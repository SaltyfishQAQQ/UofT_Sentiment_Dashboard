Tried emailing/calling for weeks and got nothing. The dean listed on the site? Never available. Always “in a meeting,” never actually there for students. Now they put me into Campus One as a “temporary fix,” but I’ll have to move AGAIN when Oak opens. So basically: move in ➝ move out ➝ move in again. What a mess!",comment,5

The UofT team and Daniels Corporation, who partnered together on this condo, should have known well in advance that they were not going to complete construction in time before move-in. Calling this a ""last-minute delay"" is a blatant lie.

1. I heard that I have to hope that the construction office accepts my packages and keep them safe in there, then I should be able to get them back when I move in to Oak House. However, if they don't, then theres nothing that the Oak House office can do. Which is pretty annoying and I don't know what I can do after that tbh.

2. I got a shared suite with a roommate, I have a shared living room and a washroom. It’s not a bad option but it’s just not what I got assigned for the Oak House.

Im not sure if everyone who got Parkside for the temporary residence ended up coming into a shared suite, but it would be tragic if it’s not ur thing.",comment,5

The first few weeks of classes are pretty chill as well. You’ll probably get compensated for the delay for Oak house but it definitely sucks not being able to be closer to campus right away. At the end it’s up to you, not living near campus the first few weeks you will feel some inconvenience with travelling, but staying at home for a few weeks would save you some money and the hassle of moving and settling in twice.
