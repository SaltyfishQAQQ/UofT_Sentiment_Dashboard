I HATE IT SO MUCHHH I almost failed MAT137 last year because of this format, I feel like (at least for me) it just encourages skipping lectures and falling behind on content. And all of the pre-lecture videos ARE JUST LECTURE VIDEOS MADE FROM DURING COVID so it's not even the same professor as the one currentlyyy",submission,32

It’s like what’s the point of having lecture if we are just solving practice problems.. Have you tried finding study buddy or groups? I joined a study circle last semester on fable and that helped me much more than this type of lectures,comment,1
