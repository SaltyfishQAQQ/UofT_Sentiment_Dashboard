Commuting this year from the GTA and I was wondering for hours between, before and after class  (before I take public transit), what are some recs for a commuter student such as my self to do, be a part of, or hang out during those hours to be more social? In residence I could randomly call up someone or spontaneous plans but now it's harder. Also in the mornings, is it too anti-social of me to just go to the library to catch up on work before and after class? How do you guys make and sustain friendships?",submission,30
What can commuter students do to be more socially open?,HassanT1357,nbwb83l,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n5yunc/what_can_commuter_students_do_to_be_more_socially/nbwb83l/,1756757678.0,"Friendships among people, similar to that among countries, initially form when there's a mutual self-interest at play.

Typically, your best chances of making friends are among people you work with in group projects,  people you repeatedly sit next to in class, or just generally people who you repeatedly see in some context and have a need to talk to. You are very unlikely to just end up making friends with some random dude in the library, for example, or a random person in line.

The key starter ingredients to befriend someone is to see them consistently in a repetitive context, and also have a legitimate need or mutual interest in talking to each other ""exclusively"" in a way. When these two things are met, you have the pre-requisite conditions necessary to make friends. After this it comes down to things like whether you're both sufficiently sociable/friendly or otherwise compatible people in that regard (which usually I would say isn't that much of a problem unless one or both of you are very anti-social or unsociable). This is sort of the ""unwritten/subconscious rules"" on how friends are made and sustained.

My best advice as a 4th year Engineering commuter is to pick one person from one of your group projects or person you sit next to and to just chat with them nicely and exchange socials. The more natural your need to talk (such as being in a group together), the easier it is. Then, on consistent consecutive days, sit with them or talk to them in situations where it's natural to do so. After a while, you will find yourselves naturally gravitating towarde each other in social contexts because youll have more familiarity with each other as compared to with the others around you. Often times, venting about classes or the professor or the class work at hand is the best ice breaker or way to initially bond. I think with this method you shouldn't have too many problems.

I hope that helps.

Edit: If you're in upper years, I would avoid trying to befriend someone already part of a ""clique"" or group of friends. This is notoriously hard to do and has a low chance of success typically as cliques and close friends keep to themselves. Your highest chance is with people who are in similar positions to yourself (people in a new context with nobody they know around, like yourself).",comment,20

Definitely wasn’t the most social butterfly walking into university but it honestly was so different when I did orientation week.

My advice, that I also plan to follow, is to compliment people, start conversations within tutorials, lectures, etc and look for places we can hang out around campus. Hart House, Sidney Smith, etc those are decent places to hangout.

But referring to my first point, the best way I opened up conversations with people is complimenting something about their appearance. Don’t fake it obviously, compliment something that actually pertains to you. And even if you don’t find anything, ask opinion/feeling active questions like “why did you take this course” etc etc to other people around you. I did that and ended up getting acquainted with so many people throughout orientation week.

Hope this helps, feel free to dm if you want any specifics!",comment,2

I've commuted for two years now. Its around a 1-1:30hr commute for me.   
  
The best way I've found to be socially open started with attending FROSH or orientation week. If you missed this or chose not to attend, the next best option is group projects or lectures. Lectures can be tough to actually make friends through, I would suggest group projects or anyone you have some sort of 'forced' proximity (via schedule or other things).   
  
I would have to say not to waste your time or be too hung up on trying to be social. I found second year to be much easier and comfortable compared to first year. People are more open, we've already seen familiar faces and likely have contact info from misc interactions. People are also more mature and will often accept any invites to hang out.   
  
If you have downtime I would suggest to join a club or genuinely just message someone / ask if any friends have time off to eat or meet up. Like I said, it doesn't hurt you in any way to send a message or simply ask ;). Worst case scenario, they say no. Best case? You have a bestie.",comment,2
