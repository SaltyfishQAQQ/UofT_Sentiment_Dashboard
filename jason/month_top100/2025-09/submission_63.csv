"Yes, that email is a scam: a redux from last year's post to avoid being grifted",RJean83,1ndkfmy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ndkfmy/yes_that_email_is_a_scam_a_redux_from_last_years/,1757524850.0,"Last year I posted about how that email is a scam. I beg the pardon of the moderators if I repost it with some edits. It is long but frankly shorter than falling for a scam.

Welcome, if you are new to the U of T email system you have now joined an email system with literally hundreds of thousands of other people. And you will be receiving so many scam emails that you will be shocked when you get a legit message.

Please look out for the following scams, they are some of the most common.

1. ""Your email is being suspended or discontinued, give your info to us and we will keep it going!"" That never happens. If U of T decides to delete your email they will just be warning you months in advance. There is never a renewal process.
2. Job Opportunity you never applied for: You are offered a job or an application for a job. They tell you it is easy money, only a few hours a week and you work from home. They never tell you what the job is, or specifically who it is for, or if it is named it is for a big name organization that would never actually hire randomly. They want your bank or email info.
3. Offer of any money or scholarship that can't be verified from an outside source. If you didn't apply for that scholarship, or it didn't come directly from your college or department, it is a scam.
4. ""They have your private secret details and will blackmail you in bitcoin"". They never hack into your computer. They have nothing on you. They may list an old password on there to trick you but if they could they would have hacked your bank account.
5. This is your professor. Only email me at this address. I need your help, and by help I mean gift cards.

Signs to watch out for-

1. You don't know the person emailing you. Lots of scammers will use a u of t email to look legit. But google the email. The admin assistant of the department of architecture is not emailing you with a job, they just borrowed her email.
2. Grammar and spelling errors. This is a prestigious school. They can afford auto-correct. Also look for any cash amounts that use USD. We are Canadian, and will only use CAD when talking money.
3. They insist on only that email address. Jobs, scholarships, tech issues, all have an email that can be easily found and a phone number somewhere, and there is often a generic department email instead of a specific person unless you know that person already.
4. They ask for your password or personal info. THE SCHOOL ALREADY HAS YOUR SIN, YOUR PHONE NUMBER, YOUR BANKING INFO. THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK AGAIN VIA RANDOM EMAIL.

Report the emails as phishing with the red flag icon, and delete. Never reply to them, you are just showing them it is an active email and someone wants to engage with them.

Practice safe emailing:

1. If you need to reset your password, share info via email or phone, etc., use only the contact email made available on the U of T website. Or ideally, you go in person and they can talk with you face-to-face.
2. Only access ACORN and other U of T sites, along with your online banking and the CRA, through the actual website, not through email links. This is true even for legit emails.
3. Keep your antivirus software updated on all your devices.
4. If you want to remove your name from the listserv and not receive these emails, you can do so by:

* Search up utorID management
* under ""Make Changes"" select ""change Legacy UTORmail options""
* login and scroll down
* check off ""Do not list <your email> in the directory and hide from the GAL""

Just please use more common sense than your 80-year old grandpa who is falling for a romance scam and you will be fine. Stay safe this year!",submission,53

* **Urgency:** They'll often want you panicked and feeling forced to make a decision in a short period of time. If you see a call to reply within X hours or days, it's a red flag.
* **DUO authentication**: As a correlate to passwords, no official office will need you to provide a DUO bypass code or to authorize their access through your DUO app. Never approve a login that you did not initiate.
* **utoronto email addresses**: emails from \[at\]mail.utoronto.ca domains typically indicate a spoofed or compromised student account. If it's \[at\]mail.utoronto.ca that's already a red flag. Official UofT offices will have an \[at\]utoronto.ca domain (but still look them up per OP's post).
* **Report scam emails using the built in reporting tool**, don't just delete them.
