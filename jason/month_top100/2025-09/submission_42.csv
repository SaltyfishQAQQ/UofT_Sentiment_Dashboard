The last thing I want to see, is a guy in just his damn underwear walking around like he owns the place!

Everyone shares one restroom, and it's a mixed gender floor. Besides, it's genuinely a little spooky seeing a 6'5 Goliath in just his underwear walking around in the middle of the night like a damn resident evil enemy.

Also; coughing. Everyone does it, obviously it's your basic human right. But if, I can hear it from morning to 2:00 AM at night, first of all get out of your dorm for once and second of all get some medication! Or at least, don't be so loud I can hear you from across the floor!

To be honest, a lot of the people UofT probably only use Chinese social media. If you are fellow Chinese, you - yes, YOU - stop going on WeChat during lectures, but secondly stop picking your nose and sucking on your finger(?, yes, this has happened) during lectures! Good grief.

While I'm at it, flush your toilets, don't smoke, don't gamble...um...most important of all, is don't butt in line in the cafeteria. I thought the Hogwarts 'real wizards flush!' posters were stupid, but I guess not. 'World's greatest minds' indeed.

Anyways, anyone looking forward to Team Fortress 3?",submission,84
