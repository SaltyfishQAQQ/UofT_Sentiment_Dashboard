The poster appears to be a conceptual diagram about the growth of the Turkish aerospace industry, framed with a religious and global perspective.

Here's a breakdown of the text:

**At the top (in Arabic):**

* **Text:** بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم
* **Translation:** ""In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."" This is the Basmala, a common Islamic phrase used to begin undertakings.

**Main Title (in red):**

* ""Store of General Hijri in Your Country worldwide""
   * The word ""Store"" might be a misspelling of ""Start"" or ""Story"". ""Hijri"" refers to the Islamic calendar, so this title suggests a global initiative or story tied to an Islamic timeframe.

**The Diagram:** The central part is a graph with two diverging lines, representing growth over time.

* **Vertical Axis (left side):** Labeled ""Turkish Aerospace Industry"" and ""Sius"".
* **Bottom Line:** Labeled with ""TAI"" (which stands for Turkish Aerospace Industries) and has text next to it: ""India-New Delhi Brings on Turkish Aircraft"". This suggests a partnership or acquisition deal with India.
* **Top Line:** Labeled ""Corisus"" (the handwriting is a bit unclear).
* **The Angle:** The angle between the two lines is explained at the bottom.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Title:** ""Angle of:""
* **Meaning:** This section lists what the angle on the graph represents. A wider angle signifies greater success in these areas:
   * Progress; Speed; Market
   * Export | Import; Share %
   * Production; much more

**In summary:**

The poster uses a simple graph to illustrate the rapid progress and market expansion (""Angle of Progress"") of the Turkish Aerospace Industry (TAI). It specifically highlights a deal involving India as a key factor in this growth. The religious heading and the term ""Hijri"" frame this industrial achievement within a broader Islamic or global context.",comment,0
