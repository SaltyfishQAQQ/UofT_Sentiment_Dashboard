Does anybody know where all 8 of the UTM slenderman pages are?,Bandestar_,1nkvjbo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nkvjbo,1758261179.0,"I saw one of the pages taped to a tree on campus near Erindale Hall last week and I asked about it and apparently they’ve been up there for a while. 

I don’t know if the pages are part of a scavenger hunt or anything, but I want to find all 8 of them and collect his pages. I don’t know if I will be rewarded or punished for this. Theories range from free lifetime parking to access to the secret McDonalds in the Davis basement. 

Regardless of what happens I plan to see this through to the end and finally beat slenderman’s evil ass slender quest. If you have any information that can aid me on my quest I would be more than grateful to reward you with several colored sticky notes and a spare regular calculator. Leave any information about the pages in the comments or in my DMs

Known locations so far:
1. On the dirt path between OPH and Erindale (Follows)
2. Outside of the instructional building, low on a tree outside of the perimeter of the soccer field hidden in some bushes on the left of the goal (Always Watches)
3. On a fallen tree to the left of the sandy volleyball area when approaching from the student union (Slenderman Forest Drawing)
4. In the middle of the trees to the right of the sandy volleyball area. You have to walk quite a considerable distance to get here. We don’t know how the original person who found this even figured to check here. (Dont Look)
