Two Offers (Toronto vs Waterloo) Is Toronto worth the extra cost?,spabook98,1n0qfdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n0qfdp/two_offers_toronto_vs_waterloo_is_toronto_worth/,1756225471.0,"Hey everyone,

I’m an international student with two PhD offers in Mechanical Engineering and I’d love some outside perspective.

Funding:

Toronto: ~31.5k/year after tax.

Waterloo: With TA + RA, I’d end up with a bit more than Toronto. Toronto professor also mentioned I probably wouldn’t have the best chances at extra awards early on since I don’t have any publications yet.


Research environment:

Toronto: Smaller team, but the professor will be on sabbatical for the first 2 terms and it didn’t sound like he’d be very available during that time.

Waterloo: Larger team, professor seems more present.


Lifestyle considerations:

I’d be moving with my girlfriend – she prefers Toronto.

I wouldn’t get a car in Toronto, but I’d consider one in Waterloo.

Toronto obviously has a lot more going on socially, but the cost of living is much higher.


So… is Toronto worth the higher cost of living given this situation? Anyone been in a similar spot?",submission,29

Also I got OGS coming in w/o a publication so the chances for awards are there. We also have applications for many MIE fellowship awards coming up. How much more could you make at Waterloo with TA? CUPE 3902 unit 1 makes $53/hour and it’s not hard to get about 65 hours a term ($2066 of base funding will come from TA so after working about 32 hours you earn the extra money so it’ll be a few thousand if you do 130 hours). We also have minimum RA payments from our supervisors but many professors can go beyond that and pay their students more.

But ultimately it depends on your supervisor. That’s arguably more important than even your university as they’re basically your boss for the next 4-5 years",comment,7

I would recommend you not to base your decision on TA, because 
- in MIE there are many many more students than available TA jobs. You may not get it, it's notoriously difficult and the allocation system is sort of broken. It's a lot easier if you work as TA for your boss, but since they are on sabbatical they may not have any.
- Your Phd is about your work and much less about TA (besides sustenance).
- If your boss is not avaliable you may not have a lot of guidance. You'll essentially be on your own for these two years. I would argue it will quite tricky, unless you have an experienced PDF to emphatically guide you.
- University name is very important, but it's not all. Your quality of work is paramount. Decide the project that align with your interests, at a location that serves you better in the long term.


All the best and congratulations on the offers :)",comment,2

You will quickly make up the difference in PhD stipend during your first years with a job afterwards. Honestly, even if you needed to take out a small loan to support living costs during your program, it’s worth doing to attend a better program. The goal of a PhD is to train you up to do research and hence help prepare you for a career. So, what matters is how the programs would affect your future career prospects. What do you want to do post PhD? I would talk to current students at each school and look at their alum placements to try to figure out people’s job prospects after each program and which is more appealing to you",comment,2

Waterloo is better for you academically and financially. As you mentioned, it's a larger team, and the professor is more accessible, with living costs being much cheaper in Waterloo compared to Toronto. 

Pros: Lower living costs, Prof seems more  present,  

Cons: Less networking opportunities, fewer social activities(boring), might have to get a car so that in(insurance, gas, maintenance), larger research team (not necessarily a good thing, and you might spend less time with the Prof since his time is divided between a larger team)

UofT:

Toronto would be a better social and networking environment, and it would look better on your resume. UofT has more prestige than Waterloo after all, irrespective of the program. Especially for exploring jobs outside of Canada (e.g., the US, UK, etc.). 

Pros: More networking opportunities and more social activities(not boring), UofT's prestige/name, world recognition and reputation, do not have to buy a car, smaller research team(more opportunities to learn, connect and more time spent with the professor ideally) 

Cons: Higher living costs, the prof is not as available/present. 

  
Both are objectively ""good"" options and great universities. Factor in the pros and cons of each and see what you prioritize. I'd personally choose UofT, and I might be biased, but I value the city, activities, social life and the prestige of UofT and the name. I mean, being the only Canadian university that ranks top 25 globally year in and year out means something..",comment,1

Would it be feasible to move to Toronto area with your girlfriend and transit or drive to Waterloo if needed ? Does your girlfriend have a job or is she studying or just living with you. Toronto has a lot more opportunities for social life, international food/culture and meeting people and otherwise.

I know a lot of my PhD friends moved out of the university area after 1st year as after first year a lot of the work is independent research based. A lot of them also work part time and then complete the studies. 

You could also move to Waterloo for the first year then move out.",comment,1

Overall UofT has a lot more reach, exposure and better rankings, prestige and reputation on the world stage, than all other Canadian universities. 

This is for 4 reasons: 

1. UofTs level of research output, quality of the research, groundbreaking nature of it and scale of it. It’s a research intensive university and almost all professors are published in academic journals and are actively doing research. In fact it’s much more research oriented and focused than teaching focused…

2. The name. After all it’s named after Canada’s biggest and most popular city. Anyone in the world knows Toronto, but not everyone knows of Waterloo, London ON, even Montreal and Vancouver aren’t on the same level as Toronto in terms of international recognition and fame. 

3. Quality of the students. It has some of the toughest and highest admission requirements, especially for its graduate schools, programs and Med school and Law school. The students that get accepted are the very best of the best. 

4. Majority of UofT professors are Ivy league or Oxbridge alumni and the rest taught at those institutions. In fact UofT has the most Ivey league or Oxbridge alumni professors out of all Canadian universities.",comment,1

90 hours would be say two one-hour tutorial every week plus around 30 hours of grading (say split into short weekly quiz grade plus one 15h midterm grading)plus invigilation plus a bit of training. This adds up to more like 75h but you got the idea.

If you want to make more you can work in the summer semester as well. It's comprised of two terms where courses are often read at double speed so you will still have some vacation time too.
You can lecture after say year 3 or around that time. Being a lecturer for a semester is equivalent to 180h of pay (or used to).
It's more of a hassle if you are a coordinator as well, so choose wisely:) 
Reading all the emails ""my granny died so I can't do the homework today"" is somewhat mind boggling after 25th letter with different reasons.
