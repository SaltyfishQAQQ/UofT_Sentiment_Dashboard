how does ANYONE know what to do?????? how do you do these readings???? how do you find these clubs??? are there even clubs like hello what is happening??? how do u get involved??? how do u find out what events are happening? parties? hello?? What is happening LITERALLY EVER I AM CONFUSED 24/7 AND EVERYBODY SEEMS SO CHILL AND I LITERALLY AHVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING

i am confused to the fullest extent, i have never been this confused in my life. and unsure. highschool was a horrible time for me but i now realize i took the community aspect for granted, we had communal lunches, smaller population, everyone knew everyone, everyone knew the drama and what was happening, events, etc. university is literally every person for themselves. and its a hard adjustment and every night i go to bed and consider seriously dropping out.

and now that im an adult its literally university or nothing. like i HAVE to go through with this and theres no other option, unless i wanna work, idk, cuz id have to work after school anyway; i dont like any of the options for life! uni or nothing or work and thats it forever now!!! elementary days are over and now im on my own and what the FYUCKKKKKKKKKK AM I DOING BRO💔💔💔💔💔

IS EVERYONE JUST OK WITH THIS AND ADJUSTING PROPERLY????? I FEEL LIKE IM THE ONLY ONE GOING BATSHT INSANE CLUELESS AND IDK WHAT IM DOING HELPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPP",submission,31

Or at least not in 1st semester. Make 2 goals: Find your footing academically, and make friends with classmates. Invite people to intentional hang outs for a limited amount of time on the weekend eg brunch, lakeshore run, something like that. If you go drinking, go with them. You will not make good friends by floating at parties aimlessly, you’ll just waste time.if you absolutely must join clubs, do so only as a general member aka no leadership roles— if you’re struggling adjusting academically, you don’t want added pressure of performing for a club group. Just. Find. Your. Footing. In. School. If you’re ahead on homework, go as a general member to a club event. Next semester or even next year, add something~ a club leadership position, maybe research (bc you focused on academics in 1st yr!), etc. base of everything is school. I know it’s hard to fight fomo but it’s so worth it to just get a grasp on school and feel like you’re winning before you add something else. Other opportunities will still be there next year, trust me. 

Do not drop out. Stop entertaining the thought of dropping out right now. Stop it. UofT open so many doors you really have no idea; even a social sciences degree here can translate into a career in tech sales, research, education, data science, hell even investment banking if you’re proactive enough and get great grades. 

If you drop out, whatever job you get will probably be your career. Uoft will open your eyes to so many possibilities for life that you may have never even considered or known existed. Optionality starts here. 

Grades are foundation for selection for high paying jobs and for research positions and grad school. You are too focused on Clubs. If you feel you are about to drop out, clubs should be the last thing on your mind. You can do it, just focus totally on academics and any extra time you have do not commit to more things, just find ways to enjoy non-committal things like attending an event / grabbing food with a friend . What you NEED to do is get a hang / flow of school, and take care of your mental health with chill social engagement that doesn’t ask any more of you. 

1st years always feel like they have to do everything. You don’t. No one expects you to, you’re like 18. No one expects you to have your career figured out. Here, your job is to derisk yourself for employers by getting a degree, learn to think critically, discover various paths and see what is good for you in your own time, and above all do what you need to do for you. Not for others, not to look on track/on time, just for you.
I know plenty of varsity athletes that had to leave their sport for like years just to focus on school, only coming back to the team in upper years or grad school. People who entered in humanities and graduated as compsci specialists. Polisci and lifesci majors who work in investment banking. For all of them, being at UofT was critical for being exposed to high performing peers, uncovering opportunities, and proving competence aligned with prestige.

Be kind to yourself, talk to yourself nicely, take care of your health, and work hard in school. By take care of yourself I mean yes social life is strongly correlated with mental health (baby monkeys literally died when given all life sustaining resources but were socially deprived). But do it intentionally, and in a structured way. Get rid of distractions. Just do school + scheduled no pressure fun. Enjoy the process, your time in uni, find pleasure/joy where you can, and add things when you have a hang of your current main task. Good luck, you can do it!!!",comment,42

Do your best to keep up with coursework and talk to people when there is an opportunity. But give yourself time to adjust. Once you get a bit more used to UofT, then you can look for more opportunities, clubs and parties.",comment,6

No future perspective to offer cause I’m also a first year so we’ll find out together if this just is what it is. Personally I’m adjusting ok to the academic side of things (humanities student so), but I’m also a bit older so I feel like that makes it easier kinda. I think a big reason I’m finding the workload doable is because I’m not at all focused on making friends and partying and stuff - first of all, I’ve been out of high school for 5yrs, so I had plenty of time to make friends and party. Secondly, everyone in my classes is 18, which is genuinely so horrifyingly young to me (I’m 23). So I’m basically just coming to campus, going to class, finding places to do work, talking to no one ever, and going home lol. Makes the workload a lot lighter. If I were you I’d focus on academics, and make ‘strategic’ friendship w people in your classes who you can work with (that sounds shitty, but not only is it useful for schoolwork, it’s also just an easy way to start a friendship that could become more than school-related)

If it makes you feel any better - walking around this place and imagining myself being 18 trying to make friends and figure everything out is HILARIOUS. I would’ve been so lost bruh are u kidding. Thank god I have no interest in making friends with all these kids because they seem to have no interest in it either lmfao - but if I did, I would be so scared and confused about how to interact with everybody. Everyone either has friends (either I guess from before uni or from… making them here? Somehow?) or keeps to themselves. There’s like zero interaction between ppl who don’t already know each other lol. It is very strange - it’s not just you thinking that

In terms of the whole “chill” thing - can’t speak for everyone else, but I personally am walking around campus actively thinking:

“just act chill dude. you’re chill, you know this shit. you know what building you’re in and where you’re going. easy shit. you know this place inside and out. oop, took a wrong turn? no worries man. just look at your phone for a sec and pretend you changed your mind about something. perfect. you know what’s going on - no worries here. nope. no confusion or discomfort whatsoever, because you’re chill”

It might work on the surface tbh. I probably look pretty chill. I am not",comment,3

And trust me, most students are also confused and feel like they don't have their shit together.

You might find it helpful to speak to a peer mentor from the CLSS! Your department may have a similar program or initiative too. They can mainly advise you on learning strategies, but they can also help with wayfinding and offering student perspectives. You can book appointments through folio.",comment,2
