The first week of class has been really exciting for me - I’ve been saving up for uni since I graduated high school, and dreaming of UofT specifically, so it’s felt pretty surreal. The campus is beautiful, my classes so far have been interesting and manageable, and I feel I’m adapting well to the grind of keeping up. 

Since I’m a bit older, the social element of uni is not a huge priority for me. I’ve lived in Toronto my whole life, went to high school here and made lots of friends, and in the five years since high school I’ve made plenty more - so my social circle is solid already. I live with my best friend in an apartment, we go out with people, I have a boyfriend and he has lots of friends, etc. I’m also a bartender, which has definitely improved my ability to talk to strangers and ignore my social anxiety. 

However, I’m struggling to push myself through the social element of school. In a couple of my classes, there have been “introductory activities”, i.e. turn to the person next to you and chat type stuff, which have been embarrassingly uncomfortable for me lol. I feel really weird talking to 18 year olds. The “friends” I’ve made in class (I’ve exchanged phone numbers and instas with like 4 people so far, just to have contacts in my classes) are really nice - but again, they’re 18. I don’t see myself ‘hanging out’ with them obviously - even studying with them is a weird idea lol. They are having a very different uni experience - they’re staying on residence, living on their own for the first time, and being…. 18. I have very little in common with them. It’s especially strange because I look pretty young and could pass for 18, so I’ll immediately be like “I’m 23 btw”, which has gotten some pretty funny reactions. I can tell that they think I’m like 30, which is honestly kinda accurate compared to an 18 year old haha. Obviously I’m aware that not everyone at UofT is freshly 18 - there are of course many people on campus who are my age or older. It’s just difficult to meet them since I’m taking all first-year classes. 

So I’ve been keeping to myself on campus, which is fine for the most part since like I said, I don’t feel a pressing need to expand my social circle. But I’m worried that I may miss out, number one, on the academic benefits of studying and discussing material with people in my classes - and number two, on meeting the many interesting and intelligent people who I’m probably passing by all the time. It feels a little weird to be having this exciting experience all on my own. I’ve been going on and on to my friends and my boyfriend about my classes, my professors, campus - but they’re not *there* with me, so it’s a little unsatisfying. 

If anyone knows of any clubs I could join that provide opportunities for genuine social engagement, lmk - but I do have a full course load, so chill clubs would be good. Even just events on campus where you’re forced to talk to people, ideally people who are not all first-years. Or if anyone has been in the same spot and figured out how to go about meeting people, lmk. I basically just wanna meet people my age, have people to work/study with, and maybe make some new friends along the way. Feel like a loser writing this post haha. ",submission,45

One thing I’ve learned (even if I haven’t fully internalized it yet) is to not let the age difference be a source of anxiety. U of T attracts a lot of brilliant, mature students and I’ve been surprised by how often I’ve had really solid, thoughtful conversations with people born in ‘06 or ‘07.

I ended up meeting a few people my age through clubs, and even one through this subreddit. But I didn’t deliberately look for clubs with older members  I just picked clubs based on genuine interest, and it turned out that lots of undergrads around our age (and even postgrads) were in them too. So I’d say focus on what interests you, and the right people tend to show up.

Martial arts clubs for example have a few older members from what I noticed, the outing club too. 

Also, even though we might feel older than first years, we’re not that far off. We’re not ""mature students"" yet, and we’re still in the same general life stage so don’t let that “I’m 23 and they’re 18” mindset stop you from meeting like minded people. This isn’t high school anymore; uni brings people of all ages together, and soon age won’t even register unless you’re in wildly different life stages (which you're not).

And yeah, maybe it’s more relevant when it comes to romantic relationships, but for friendships, study partners, and just connecting with interesting people? That age gap really isn’t a dealbreaker at all.",comment,19

I’m 23 entering my second year, and experienced the exact same thing heading into first year (and still second, lol). Everyone in my classes are pretty young and I’ve had some negative reactions when I tell them my age. I don’t really have friends at uni as a result. I work full time and am seeing someone, so I’m pretty busy, too. 

We likely won’t share any classes due to me being in my second year, but DMs are open if you want to chat!

As someone who's been through this now twice, I can't say it gets better the older you get. Most people won't say anything to your face, but the moment age comes into question the conversation completely changes.

Ultimately, these are judgements based on ignorance and entitlement. The worst offenders are the ones who think they're geniuses and are using their university experience as an elaborate networking opportunity. Everything to them is about assessing who's ""worthy"" of their time and who isn't. 

It takes time and effort to sift through the bad apples, but don't doubt the real reason why you're doing this: to get a great education for a great job down the line.

If you somehow go through the full program and don't meet anyone who you actually connect with beyond class, it doesn't matter. You already have a robust social circle beyond classes, so anything you get along the way is just a bonus. 

Also, if this is any consolation, many people from cohorts over the years who are having their ""normal"" experience straight out of high school report not making any friends in their first year. Not really surprising given how social dynamics have changed after the pandemic and how cutthroat the first year typically is.",comment,3

The mentality total changed when I simply forgot about age. Make friends with whoever vibes you vibe with. Plus don't make your age the first you talk about when you met a new person.
