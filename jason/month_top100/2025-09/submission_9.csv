i even tried to be nice (mistake, clearly) and told y’all very calmly “hey, can you whisper, we can’t hear.” 

what do i get? a smirk. silence for a whole two minutes (wow, so generous), and then you were right back at it like nothing happened. like you’re the main character and the prof is just background noise. love that.

if you wanna play games and treat uni like a café, do it from home. no one’s stopping you. but don’t come to class and ruin it for everyone else who’s actually trying to, idk, learn something. wild concept, i know. because if this happens again, i won’t be so polite. just saying. genuinely crashing out.",submission,393

They likely share your sentiment and would appreciate being able to say, ""A student has asked me to request that you keep your side conversations to a minimum so that they are able to learn...""",comment,95

In csc148 this summer, the prof would notice people talking, playing video games, eating and skipping class to study for mat102. One day he mentioned that he can make this course much harder if he wants to if everyone is “so bored”. Fast forward to the final exam, he said he would make it really tough and he definitely did.
