Has anyone considered dropping out and just getting a regular job?,throwaway_062025,1n6pxax,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n6pxax/has_anyone_considered_dropping_out_and_just/,1756834342.0,"I desperately feel like dropping out. It sounds dramatic but I’m kinda sick of this. It’s not even that I don’t want to be in school. I want to go to uni and get an education but I feel so fucking overwhelmed. Getting a part time job is so fucking hard especially having minimal experience. I just finished year 1 (starting year 2 in a few days). I really just want to work and make real money at a real fucking job literally anywhere that will take me full or part time just fucking anywhere. I hate living off my parents and using their money (they’re kind of nuts). But I literally just want to make money because I hate being unemployed. I’ve applied online and in person and I’m literally going in person to ask stores if they’ll take my resume in person so yeah. I’m really fucking depressed right now and I don’t know if I can handle going back to class and coming back home applying online and waiting to get rejected or ghosted.

Like I want to continue and get a degree and maybe if I did drop out in a few years when I make enough money I’ll go back and finish. If I did drop out I know I’d have to repay OSAP and my grants will become a loan and that’s fine as long as I make enough to pay them back. But it feels helpless not being able to work literally just going back home and not working like it feels useless and like I’m wasting my time for this degree. Even the degree I’m doing requires experience for entry level jobs which I don’t have. I’m passionate about my degree and want to continue but I don’t even know if I can.

I’m in a financially difficult place and it feels like it’s not worth it right now and continuing this for three more years feels useless. Being the first in my family to go to uni is good and all but idk anymore.

Edit: thank you guys actually reading your advice and from people who have gone through the same or known someone who has is helpful and I’ll consider counselling like someone else suggested 🥶🥶",submission,31

Dropping out will forever change your life and not for the better. You’re already in, you’re 25% done, lock in and finish.

You will get tired of working for crappy pay. Invest in a good education to find a good field of work. Your undergrad years will be fun and it depends on how you make of it. The last thing you need is to get a job to join the endless and pointless rat race of corporate America. Invest in yourself when you are young. You don't realize just how expensive the real world is.,comment,16

I appreciate my education more now that I’m a little older and WANT to be in school. Worked full time those two years and although everything worked out, I do find myself sometimes wishing I just thugged it out and finished “on time”. I’m also in a similar situation now looking for part time work (looked all summer LOL) so as awful as it is, just know you’re not alone.
