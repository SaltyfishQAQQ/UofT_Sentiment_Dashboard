I never for once thought my first reddit post would be about this. My apologies  if this is the wrong reddit section. Just like the title mentions, my pink tote bag(baby pink) was stolen from a locker in the women's changing room at Athletic centre today between 6:30pm-7:00pm. I had a couple things in there but most importantly, my white wallet, that has ALL my IDs. To whoever stole it, please, I'm begging you on my knees to please take everything you want but PLEASE please please, return my IDs. Literally just return them to athletic centre front desk or Robarts Library's lost and found desk and say you picked them up on the floor or whatever. I don't even need the wallet. Please just return my IDs and I would really appreciate it. I'm so stressed  rn and don't even know what to do. I don't have anything against you and totally understand that you might've needed something from my bag to take you through the day. So Please take everything and return my IDs. Thank you for reading my long post. Once again, my apologies if this is the wrong section. Have a great night!",submission,48

It happened to me a while ago. I started to replace cards based on urgency. My cashless wallet did get returned through the mail before I got around to replacing my driver's license.

I suggest you start by canceling and replacing your any financial cards, and cards with monetary value, like your presto card. 

I hope you get everything back, but start canceling and replacing at least your cards with financial value.",comment,1
