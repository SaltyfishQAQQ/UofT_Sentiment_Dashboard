There are tons of talented student designers at the university who would probably love the chance to get to contribute something lasting to the entire university. It would be really really cool and benefit every single student at UofT, across all 3 campuses.",submission,106

Who uses a *narrow, serif* font like that? 


Anyway, as an ID card enthusiast and niche hobby consultant, I respectfully submit a few hints. I'm not an authority. I am a mere humble ID card-obsessed fanatic.


So,uh...Pro tips, I guess: a redesign would need to be made way in advance of an order, meaning there are probably a tonne in reserve, and the cost of each card means none are likely to be tossed. Besides: it's a waste of plastic! There are also contracts in place, which create some other barriers to change. But, with preserverence, it could happen.


The portrait preportions are 7:10. I suggest that the box that the photo sits in be removed so that a slightly misaligned photo doesn't clip out of the frame.


The position of the chip in the card cannot intersect with any place where the card printer does its thing, or it will just won't stick. Different vendors make it fun by putting the chip in different locations locations. So the card template needs to allow for maximum compatibility for different batches of cards. Sometimes the chip is hidden on the left side, and other times it's on the top or bottom (sometimes depending on the location of the magnetic stripe on the back). This doesn't apply to the printed template, but does for the text and portrait elements - allow for that! 


The colour, size, and contrast in the barcode region cannot change because they need to work with every UT device that reads the cards.  UTSC athletic centre? Check. Robarts? Check. I imagine that a lot of consultations happen(Ed) to decide on a barcode standard to use, and changing it would her non-negotiable since changes to this means that the cards might not work on some devices.


So if you decide to explore this with the Innohub or whatever, just keep that stuff in mind. Don't take it personally if there's hesitation to accept any suggestions, or that they'll take a while to appear if it is given consideration. These things rarely move, and then they move slowly. But new ideas rule, so like, have fun!",comment,1
