Just want to say, this is a huge change and I for one welcome it! Maybe now we could finally soon get complete digital T-Cards stored in our phone wallet where you can tap with NFC instead of carrying around a physical card. Hell even YorkU has had digital cards for a while now, glad UofT is finally bringing it self into today's tech.",submission,41

They wouldn’t let us have both options—being uoft, they would want to save money. I personally don’t own a smartphone (typing this on a tablet), so I would probably be fugged if that became the only option. There were some problems at York regarding this issue.",comment,3

I think at York, you could still get a physical card but you have to pay for it - it might become the same for us where digital card is free, but physical while available, you might end up paying for it.",comment,1
