The energy to produce the paper towel is, as you allude to, less than that of a hand dryer (assuming 2 paper towels vs an 1800 watt dryer). However, that does not account for the transport of the paper towel, which has emissions. Buuuut then again in some places the power grid is so heavily fossil fuel based that goes the other way yet again.

In short: they‚Äôre pretty comparable if you aren‚Äôt the jerk who uses 20 paper towels.

Also, importantly, the situation has altered slightly in favour of electric dryers in recent years as we have developed more efficient hand dryers.

TCards for both St. George and UTSC are eligible since they both fall within Toronto and TPL's geographic service area. For TCards for UTM, getting a TPL wouldn't be possible since it's not located in Toronto (we'll double-check this and provide an update if that's not the case).

An lady approached and shot really loud at me to issue a final warning. Everyone turned their head to look. I felt really bad and embrased. She said waterbottle was not allowed in the dining hall, not even on backpacks. When asked what should I do with this she immediately shoted ""don't bring it or whatever"". Considering I don't live here, this is basically equivalent to not comming back again. I asked her if there is a list or rules/policy and she said it's being printed. It felt really weird being issued a ""final warning"" given that there is not even written policy. After issuing it to me she approached a girl with coffee from outside who looled like she was about to cry.

Is there a source of complaint I can submit for these kind of non inclusive and offensive behaviour from a campus stuff?",submission,474

You have to use their papper cups? Or forced to buy drinks? What happened to UofT sustainability effort? I remember back in my days they don't sell water bottles cuz they try to promote having your own water bottle and have refills stations everywhere.

Believe they‚Äôre calling themselves Restored Church Toronto now. 

Usually I wouldn‚Äôt have bothered but they caught me the week after a close family member passed. I‚Äôm exactly like all of you where rationally I‚Äôd be like ‚Äúwho would go to a random Bible group‚Äù but these groups work best on people caught at bad times, so there I was. 

Honestly, they do a great job of appearing dynamic, modern, and engaging. The whole goal is to get you ‚Äúbaptized‚Äù. Lots of love bombing and mutual ‚Äúconfessing of sins‚Äù along the way so you feel bonded to those mentoring you. The first service I went to, one of the senior female members got my number and continued to text trying to convince me to come back until I blocked her. Discretely implied that you will devote all spare time and money to the church. You are encouraged to date within the church or get your partner converted. Nothing past hugs (not too long though) with the opposite sex until marriage. You can take on advanced leadership roles by paying money for scam courses. I am very thankful I never got baptized. 

Again, easy to be like ‚Äúwho tf would entertain this‚Äù but it‚Äôs gradual and subtle and like I said, it works if you‚Äôre already struggling. 

I‚Äôve seen them at York and George Brown, too. There‚Äôs now Google results calling them out but when it happened to me, there was nothing as it was pretty new. Figured I‚Äôd add my 2 cents to the search results lol.",comment,51

They‚Äôre still far richer than any other university and have hundreds of millions in funding per year. 

And almost all top 50 universities worldwide are in the US. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd be fine and it‚Äôs not the end of the world. This presidents term will end in 3.5 years and it‚Äôs business as usual. Even now the students are not feeling the effect as much as you claim. Universities don‚Äôt just change overnight just cuz the man in the Oval Office said so.

And this fear-mongering other people engage in, in this comment section, has no place here. UofT is a private institution and by default the entire academic apparatus, institutions and the whole system in Canada is fundamentally different. 

And politics in Canada is never as polarized and extreme as the US. Our Conservative Party looks liberal compared to their Republican counterparts. Canada was never affected by extremities or polarizing ideologies, and bipartisan party politics. 

Universities everywhere are by default a liberal institution, even in countries like Iran(my home country) they‚Äôre a liberal institution and clash with the government. 

Sometimes this liberal ideology does go to extremes with that ideology. But in a free society we can all agree to disagree so long as we engage in civil discourse, stay respectful and don‚Äôt harm one another or infringe on another‚Äôs rights and freedoms.

Many programs that people applied to, were accepted to, accepted offers, and then rejected other offers...had the rugs pulled out from underneath them when those programs were pulled due to funding issues.  Tuition jumped again and the ability to pay back loans became even harder (unless you decide to join ICE).  The restrictions on student loans became even tighter.  Gun violence on campus is a ever present threat (UC Boulder, where I live, was locked down just yesterday for a weapon on campus).

A friend of mine said she dropped her daughter off at Univ of Arizona last week and noted that our old dorm was completely closed due to lack of demand for student housing.  The headlines do not communicate all that is happening on the ground and reported in local news.

Merit aid is almost non existent unless you are an athlete.  Need based aid is only offered to low income households even though the tuition is SO high that even high income households can't actually afford it.  We are comfortable and make good money, but who the heck has $40,$60,$90k PER YEAR to pay for their child's tuition (and that doesn't include housing or food!) Boulder is $40k, col. School of Mines is $60k, Yale is $92k (these are the financial info packets I personally saw this year and none of these totals include housing).

Again I‚Äôm not saying these aren‚Äôt happening, but the universities still attract students and still hold on to their rankings. 

My entire point was that It‚Äôs not the chaos the media portrays it to be. It‚Äôs still bad but the US is still a free society and democracy and there‚Äôs checks and balances on everything. And all this will pass, it‚Äôs not permanent. And that the apparent threats and extreme sentiments won‚Äôt influence Canada or Canadian universities because Canada and US are quite different politically, socially and the political and cutler landscape and foundation is inherently different. 

Canada is deeply multicultural, prone to change and much more liberal as a society and country. The US is a melting pot, relies on assimilation and is dominated by polarizing and extreme bi partisan politics on the verge of tribalism. 


You mentioned the example of merit aid and loans and used Yale as an example which is a flawed example. You‚Äôre using a top 5 ranking US university, an ivy league institution, and using that to justify your claims on the hundreds of universities across the US. 

I am not condoning any of this. Just pointing out facts. For instance where‚Äôs the statistics on restrictions on higher student loans or gun higher gun violence on ‚Äúcampuses‚Äù? 

Just because one incident happened here or there it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs an overall increase in that metric. 

Just because there‚Äôs construction and traffic on point X, Y and Z in the city, it doesn‚Äôt mean the city is drowned in construction and traffic‚Ä¶See how that logic is flawed? 

This is because‚Ä¶..drum role please 






Correlation doesn‚Äôt equal causation. 









And it‚Äôs just sad that instead of having a civil discussion here people get emotional and just downvote merely because my views don‚Äôt conform with their worldview. 

We can still disagree or dicsusss things and have opposing views. That‚Äôs literally the foundation of what a university is. Asking questions, questioning the narrative and Socratic dialogue to reach a common understanding.",comment,-4

Yale ranks higher as an overall school, but for the program my son is in... Toronto ranks higher).  My son received financial breakdowns of the two state schools because he was accepted to both.  His best friend got one from Yale that he shared with us.  

Go read the subreddit 'student loans'.  The issue with tuition, loans, etc is unfortunately the norm for a majority of students.  Most do not have a 529 that is funded well enough to cover tuition for 4 years or they don't have one at all and unless you are earning a million or more every year, most families cannot afford to pay out what can easily amount to $250k-$500k for their kids' tuition until graduation.  This is particularly true when you look at the fact that many families have multiple children.

The biggest issue I see from my perspective right now (aside from money) is that many programs were cut at many schools last spring.  I know Boulder had to cut several (programs that had to do with climate studies, cancer research, and farming solutions) because funding was cut to one area and that area had multiple programs that depended on it.  Trump also cut NOAA funding ($30M and 1$1.5B respectively).  Both of these affect programs at Boulder and honestly... NOAA currently provides key weather information and monitors solar flares for both the US and Canada (and the world).  We'll see how that goes in 2026 when the hammer officially drops.  

Point being, if you enter a program at Boulder and many other public universities right now and Trump decides to cut more here and more there, your program could vaporize in the middle of earning your degree.  What do you do when you're two years into your program and Trump decides for more cuts and you are midway into a program that doesn't exist anymore.  It's not fear mongering considering it already happened.  

But go back for minute.. you talked about all these high ranking schools in the US.. those would be schools like Yale (which you have decided to treat as an outlier nowü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) so this does matter.  But either way, merit aid is practically non existent right now unless you choose a low ranked school that is practically begging for you to attend.  My son was Valedictorian, graduated with a lot of fancy credentials attached to his name, etc.  Boulder gave $4k for general merit aid which is the max they give to anyone and then $1,000 for being ranked 1st at his school in Colorado (only available for Colorado students).  Mines gave nothing.  Yale and other ivies do not do merit aid at all and if you earn above $300k, you qualify for no need based aid at all.  Seriously... go read 'student loans'.  And yes, I personally know plenty of people who ended up in the same boat.  My niece took more than 10 years to pay her loans and she AGGRESSIVELY paid.  She's a nurse and has been out of school for 15 years now.  It's gotten much worse in those years.

Keep in mind that Trump took office last January.  This will be the first year where those cuts are going to be felt.  I simply would not trust being able to finish a degree in the US for right now whether it's because the program disappears, you can't afford tuition, the new loan caps mean you can't even borrow the money needed to cover tuition if you wanted to, or ICE comes for you (if you are brown or an international student) or ICE comes for your professorsü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.  

Students will continue to graduate for the next 4 years... some of them anyway.  It's risky though.  My son had an option that not a lot of American students have because he has dual citizenship and I am grateful for it.

In hindsight, I just didn't focus and study hard like I should have. There were no extenuating circumstances like health issues, I just didn't study hard enough. Now, my prospects for grad school are near zero, and I have disgraced my entire family.

My mother has said that grad school is non-negotiable. Everyone in my family has at least a Master's, and they will disown me if I can't at least obtain a Master's from a prestigious university. My sisters (both of whom are doing PhDs right now) said to me that getting good grades was the one thing I had going for me, and now I have lost that too. My father says that if I was going to fail like this anyways, I should never have gone to UofT in the first place; I could have just gone to some no-name university and saved everyone the trouble. The truth is, I'm an international student and my parents worked very hard to fund my expensive education, so I have wasted a lot of their money now. When I first came to Canada, I was the pride of my family, but now at all the family gatherings my parents are forced to pretend I don't exist, out of shame.

My parents have told me to return to the motherland immediately following my graduation and find work so that I can repay the funds they invested into my education. My own dream of grad school is over now; by the time I pay them back I will be well past the window of productivity in my field of interest. I wish I could say that life is just unfair sometimes, but in this case life has actually been very fair to me, and my situation is entirely self-inflicted. Studying at UofT is a privilege, and I wish I had not taken this opportunity for granted.",submission,244

All I will say is your parents disowning you if you don‚Äôt graduate with a masters from a highly prestigious university is fucking ridiculous, and any reasonable person would understand having an off semester. 

My dad took 9 years to finish his undergrad with a bachelors in engineering, and he barely used that degree, and now he can afford to send me internationally to u of t from brazil. But you and your parents think there will be no opportunities for you in life if you don‚Äôt get a masters at a top 20 school.

Just a btw, but most grad schools will look at your last 2 years of grades, and what they want to see most is an upward trend. 

I ended up going to law school after undergrad, and while I performed quite well in first year, I ended up adding a program I hadn‚Äôt originally planned to study that was in a different discipline to what I‚Äôm used to (more sciences than humanities) and did on the lower side of average in those courses. I was also worried that it would impact any postsecondary aspirations that I had ‚Äî but it didn‚Äôt. I did better in third and fourth year, and ended up focusing more on my strengths via course selection (ie choosing courses I knew I would do better in, even in my new major). 

So I wouldn‚Äôt discount grad school entirely. Even if you are in third or fourth year ‚Äî you can always choose to extend your degree with more credits and not graduate on time if grad school is non-negotiable.

But let me tell you this straight: your life is not over just because you had one bad semester.

When I came here after high school, I had no safety net. I had to juggle paying international tuition fees while working 2‚Äì3 part-time jobs just to survive. There were days I thought I couldn‚Äôt keep going. My grades slipped too, but you know what? Things did eventually get better ‚Äî because life isn‚Äôt defined by one season of struggle.

You only get this one life. And if you spend it only trying to meet your family‚Äôs definitions of ‚Äúsuccess,‚Äù you‚Äôll lose yourself. Yes, it‚Äôs good to respect your parents and repay their efforts, but you also need to protect your own mental health and dreams. Grad school is still possible ‚Äî people bounce back from academic dips all the time with extra coursework, post-grad diplomas, or research experience. Even if you don‚Äôt end up in the ‚Äúprestigious‚Äù path your family wants, you can still carve out a future where you feel proud of yourself.

The truth is, failure doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre done ‚Äî it means you‚Äôve been given a chance to learn resilience. Everyone successful has had moments where they thought they ruined everything. What matters is how you get up now.

So instead of burying yourself in guilt, start fresh:
	‚Ä¢	Focus on doing your best in your remaining courses. A strong comeback matters.
	‚Ä¢	Explore internships, co-ops, or work that can build your profile ‚Äî grad schools value practical experience too.
	‚Ä¢	And most importantly, remember that you‚Äôre not just living for your parents‚Äô pride. You‚Äôre living for yourself.

I understand the pressure to ‚Äúdo a Master‚Äôs for your parents.‚Äù I‚Äôve felt that weight too. But at the end of the day, you can‚Äôt let one GPA dip convince you that your whole life is ruined. You‚Äôre still young, you still have time, and you still have the chance to make something out of this journey.

Trust me ‚Äî the story isn‚Äôt over.",comment,7

When you have children, you have all sorts of hopes and for many people expectations can be part of that. But the truth is, a child is not your property, pawn, or chance to live out what you missed. Your parents will never say this to you but as a parent I will: part of maturing is doing the work to learn yourself, and this is usually in-step with developing the resolve and courage to disappoint those who love you most. You are not their project, they do not get to demand your indefinite future in exchange for what they sacrificed for you to fulfill their dreams for you. As an emerging adult, your own fulfillment for your life is north star. 

So, you reflected and saw your grades dropped bc you fucked around instead of nose to the grindstone, in years that matter for future. Yeah that sucks and I see why your parents are pissed re: $ paid. Now what? Work hard again and finish as strong as you can, that's all you can control. The bigger work is learning the skill of setting your own goals and the work back plan. If it includes a graduate degree, great go for it. If not, go for whatever it is instead. Maybe a year or two in the workforce will help inform this, maybe longer. Your parents will hopefully chill a bit when they see you working hard with the ethic they taught you and doing well.

Not a cent. They CHOSE to give birth to you, and they CHOSE to send you to school. Nobody forced them to, so they have no one to blame but themselves for expecting anything at all from their children. 

See how things go and if you can appeal to their emotions at all. If they still want to disown you and have you work in your home country to pay back the money, then try your best to become self sufficient outside of them. As disownment means those people no longer mean anything to you, and any debt to them is effectively null.  

It's not too late to fix your GPA and achieve not only success, but emotional and financial independence from your family. Now it's not easy in any sense, but it's reasonably achievable - especially if you've been capable of hard work in the past.   Don't let any notions of guilt or shame make you pay them back. If they want to treat you based on your perceived value to them rather than their child, then they should understand that they are absolutely no different from a venture capitalist. Unless you've signed some sort of legally binding contract that indicates you have to pay them back if you don't perform as expected, then I fear they've lost their money and that's on them for not understanding the risk.  

While this might sound harsh, I'm only mirroring their perspective of this being a numbers game. I'm assuming that you've felt intense pressure even before this - that stress can accumulate and cause you to burn out. Your GPA doesn't just take a significant hit for no reason. If you didn't study or focus as much as you expected, was it really just out of laziness? Despite everything perceptually riding on your success? I highly doubt that and I suggest that you look within yourself to figure out if there was anything else causing you to not study or lose focus.  

I have faith that you'll find your way :) Good luck!",comment,2

Maybe you are right, perhaps the expectations are unreasonable. I've always looked up to my parents and siblings. When I was younger, I thought studying up to a Master's was the norm and expected of anyone. Of course, I realized soon that is not the case, and after coming to Canada I even see people who only completed secondary education, but lead meaningful and successful lives nonetheless.

1. I heard that I have to hope that the construction office accepts my packages and keep them safe in there, then I should be able to get them back when I move in to Oak House. However, if they don't, then theres nothing that the Oak House office can do. Which is pretty annoying and I don't know what I can do after that tbh.

2. I got a shared suite with a roommate, I have a shared living room and a washroom. It‚Äôs not a bad option but it‚Äôs just not what I got assigned for the Oak House.

Im not sure if everyone who got Parkside for the temporary residence ended up coming into a shared suite, but it would be tragic if it‚Äôs not ur thing.",comment,5

Someone on that subreddit suggested I post them here as well so that other students might find them useful.  

So here's the first post, let me know if the community here finds these valuable.

[University is a Pull-Based System](https://medium.com/@brian_utsc/university-is-a-pull-based-system-5dd808c7beea)  
Highschool is ""Push-Based"", the goal is to give you the push to get you where you need to be. University is ""Pull-Based"", the goal is to provide resources that are available when you need them. Understanding this difference can be key to a successful transition between the two.

We're running a project with our lab that involves AI agents talking to students, and the health and we went to the health and wellness team to talk about what the agents should do when they sense that a student is in crisis. The default response was to send them to a webpage that was a giant wall of links. There were over 50 different resources and options for the student to choose from (lots of choice), but my response to them was that to a student in the midst of a crisis, a big wall of links is almost worse than no resources at all. It's overwhelming and intimidating.

Or on the other side, there are just lots and lots of resources that aren't advertised properly so that students searching them out can't easily find them.

Adding resources is great. But slow and expensive. Filtering and offering guidance to get the students the right things to pull is much faster, simpler, and can have a big impact right away.",comment,8

Some will rise to the top, some will sink to the bottom. There is not really a sense of supervision towards the students with regards to how the high school counselors used to help them. One thing that I really wanted my program supervisor to do is... **supervise** me in terms of maybe weekly meetings with regards to my academic progress, internship search, and mental health. For example, a marks/GPA tracking system could be built to monitor those who are falling behind if their marks fall below the threshold with automatic message sent to their e-mail notifying them about such developments. At the end of the day, I don't want to feel alone (or like another brick in the wall) when attending university.",comment,4

We don't have the resources to push much of anything (why the scales are tipped so far is a longer discussion to have at another time).

But there's a second issue here: The ethos of the university is that students are adults and should be treated as such. If you come to me for help, I can offer you lots of stuff, but it's not my place to push you into my office (okay, the push/pull metaphor gets muddy here, but you get the idea).

I‚Äôm feeling quite sad, upset, awful, homesick, and a litany of other negative adjectives.

I‚Äôm originally from BC‚Äîso this is my first time living away from home independently. I seriously don‚Äôt feel ready to move on from my adolescence (physically, mentally, and emotionally) sometimes. Every time I think about my home, my family, my friends, and the comfortable environment I had, I start to cry. I‚Äôm currently writing this post through tears. 

It feels really embarrassing when everyone else I know who‚Äôs out of province or international seems to handle it well.

Other than the homesickness, I‚Äôm struggling with anxiety and imposter syndrome. I‚Äôm so worried for the work load ahead of me and the possibility of failing. I knew that engineering is a notoriously difficult program before applying, but now that I‚Äôm actually here, it feels too real. I‚Äôve always been good at time management and getting things done ahead of time‚Äîbut I don‚Äôt know if I have what it takes to tackle this. 

I hope it gets better. I wish I could just fall asleep and wake up back in my home again. :(

First year is rough in multiple ways, there's no point sugarcoating it. That doesn't mean there aren't upsides, though, because we wouldn't survive without them. In 1st year I relied heavily on my roommates; we would all do our CIV100 and APS110/188/186/187 stuff together. If you can, find people who you can form a study group with and seek them out multiple times a week; that support meant the world to me.

The relationship between workload and marks is strange. The workload is objectively rough, but a lot of the stress people have I feel would be mitigated if it were more properly told to people that being 5% above the average on a midterm is like a 96% in high school. Depending on your goals, you might still want to push for a 3.25 GPA, but we wouldn't shame anyone in HS with a 93% average, now would we?

And yes, everyone saying to join a club is good advice. Design teams can be fun and provide a built-in community, while obviously boosting your resume, but I can admit they can be stressful. I have friends in UTSM, UTAT, UTFR, Blue Sky, Concrete Toboggan, Concrete Canoe, UTWind, RSX, HPVDT...

But I can't resist recommending the spirit clubs! My friends would shill for emailing [kaboom@skule.ca](mailto:kaboom@skule.ca) about when cannon guard training is, or following \\@bngcommittee on instagram for holiday builds and woodworking fun, or contributing to Skule Nite in whatever form you wish. Myself, well, I'd say you should write for the Toike Oike, and maybe join the mailing list at [lgmb.skule.ca](http://lgmb.skule.ca) ...

Also, our discipline club is cool, and our common room in the mining building is a bit run down but still a good study/hangout spot. :P

I just feel kind of alone right now and wanted to yell into a void.

Im going into my fourth year. My parents worked very hard to be able to make it in this country and give me the opportunities ive been given. There have been lots of sacrifices along the way. I saw that and worked super hard to get into u of t, and I was so excited.

When i left (originally from winnipeg) home, it was brutal, but I was kind of expecting it. My parents told me before I left that if i left, they couldnt afford to pay u of t tuition or any living accommodation (other than home). I understood, we were never wealthy or ""well off"" and i wanted them to save up because theyre getting older, and decided to pursue u of t on my own.

For the last three years, i have worked my tail off covering food, rent, my phone, utilities, tuition, and anything else necessary. I take out loans to pay for school and some living expenses but not all of them, so to make up for the gap, i work. A LOT. it doesnt matter if im tired, or sad, or exhausted, i cant stop. Ive adapted to this over the years, and it gets easier the more i do it (although still tough).

And hey, i chose to be here and its my responsibility, but sometimes it gets lonely. I wont say everyone because i would be generalizing way too much, but every person i have met at this school over the last four years is better off than i am, and yk what good for them! I really am happy for them. But it eats away at me. My friends and people i know (even at other unis in the GTA) get housing/food/tuition/living expenses/credit cards/hobbies paid by their parents. They can play sports and pursue hobbies, be part of clubs and activities (that all cost money), and as much as id love that, i cant afford that. Sometimes people will say things that are out of touch, or when they try to sympathize its not the same because they dont quite understand.

 I want to be clear: i dont hate them or anything like that. We all live different realities, and thats okay. You cant be upset at people because of things like this. Everyone has their own, VALID struggles, no matter what it is. But it does get to me at times. It feels heavy and i feel alone. More doors open for them and they get the experience they want because theyre in a better financial position. I love u of t and dont regret my choice, Its just tough sometimes.

PS: Im aware that there are perople out there in worse positions than me, this is just my experience.

The shock friends of mine got when they first started internships was funny to me since I‚Äôve been accustomed to working life.  I‚Äôm also grateful I don‚Äôt have any credit card debt and am able to support me and my cat :) a lot of students with financial support still have debt and things because they haven‚Äôt learned budgeting yet

it also helps that I‚Äôve worked odd jobs like cleaning houses that make decent money and have worked hard at student jobs to get experience and increase my wages 

Sorry for the really long text the TLDR is that financially independent students exist and we are thriving in our own ways! Also if you haven‚Äôt please look into contacting your registrar and the UTSU to apply for financial aid. DMs are always open!",comment,14

I also went to U of T from 2020 to 2024, and while my upbringing was different at the time, I lost my parents young and ended up homeless at 18, as well as few times after so I had to figure things out on my own. I have been on ODSP since 2015 because of chronic health issues and disabilities, and I am definitely not well off. Over the years I worked multiple jobs, dealt with OSAP denials, and covered rent, tuition, and living expenses. On top of that, I navigated grief, addiction, mental health challenges, trauma, and even the legal system as a victim. It has been exhausting at times and there were moments I did not think I could keep going.

There are so many others in similar situations even if it is not visible on the surface. For example , one ¬†of my mentors and close friends went to U of T while homeless and in the child welfare system. You can not always see what someone is going through just by looking at them or their circumstances. It can be so easy to compare yourself to peers who have parents covering rent, tuition, hobbies, or trips. That comparison can eat away at you but it really is the thief of joy.

What you are building, the resilience, independence, and ability to navigate challenges, is invaluable. Those experiences will shape you in ways that go beyond grades or extracurriculars. You are doing amazing even if it does not always feel like it. There are so many people hustling like you, quietly pushing through hardships, and your effort and perseverance matter more than you know.",comment,7

The youth shelter I was living in helped me with minimum payment because OSAP didn‚Äôt know how to deal with estrangement at the time and I struggled my way through my first year. Working part time and dealing with so much deep seated mental health. The over working was easier because it kept me distracted. I burned out by mid 2nd year and that is finally when I went to my college registrars office. 

My college registrars office got right into action once they learned of my family situation and having no family support. By the end of my schooling I received $50k total in grants just from UofT/ my college. My last year they provided the most at one time by giving me a $16k grant to get through my last semester of school. 

I admire all your hard work, and hear you that it‚Äôs just exhausting.. I hope you can secure some extra grants. If there is unmet need UofT will help you! Best of luck this year ‚ù§Ô∏è finish strong",comment,3

I wanted to add to this but with an international student POV, since I‚Äôm in a situation very similar to yours.

I‚Äôm entering my second year now, looking to graduate in 2028. I feel ya, juggling everything on your plate trying to get by. I‚Äôm on a full-course load while working three 8-hour shifts every week just to pay for my living expenses. My dad paid for my first and second year tuition with his life savings, and I have to fend for myself come next year since he can no longer financially support me. 

My family isn‚Äôt well off, like, at all. For my particular situation; what really makes it much more tough for me is paying international tuition.

To a certain extent I get why we international students pay more. The university should prioritize people from/living here. What really grapples my nerves is paying not double or triple, but TEN times what domestic students pay. But that‚Äôs beside the point.

I‚Äôve been trying to get a line of credit to support my tuition for the remaining two years at UofT (not looking good so far since I‚Äôm not Canadian). My dad is also trying to get a loan from back home, though it also seems quite bleak. 

Yeah‚Ä¶ maybe it wasn‚Äôt the best idea for me to go to UofT as someone who isn‚Äôt an international student loaded with their parents‚Äô money (I joke with my friends that I‚Äôm probably the poorest int. student at UofT).

But it really is scary, right now I don‚Äôt even know if I can stay til fourth year or if I have to pause my studies. 

Wishing you a great final year! A degree from UofT isn‚Äôt one from any random place afterall, so I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll succeed in whatever career you choose.",comment,2

I've never been in your situation but I can imagine how difficult it is so I'm truly sorry. About internation tuition - Canadian student tuition is subsidized through tax dollars via provincial (and some federal) payments, which is why international students pay more. I was curious how much funding so I asked chat GPT (ie. Don't hold me to these numbers...) and it said about $30k. So then I was curious how much standard tuition is at UofT (I'm a long ago alumn) and it said $6500 vs.$55k. So if we add the funding and domestic tuition together, you're roughly overpaying by $20k-25k. Of course, these numbers can vary greatly by program and institution.. 

So you're paying about 3x more tuition than domestic students, so still not good but not quite as awful as it appears on the surface if you're just comparing tuition bills. I'm sorry you have to compensate for our lack of funding/willingness to increase domestic tuition. 

That all said, it is definitely an issue in Canada in terms of overcharging and over enrolling international students and the government cracked down on that a year or so ago by reducing study permits by 35% overall and introducing international student caps at each institution. UofTs cap didn't change but some other places went down by 50% E.g. Conestoga college.",comment,2

This world (especially the corporate influence that has spread everywhere) tells people not to be emotional, not to feel, not to have thoughts, feelings, and that is extremely damaging.

If you want to cry? Do it. If you want to laugh? Go nuts. If you want to spend 6 hours making a meal that goes horribly wrong? Laugh because it's one more experience and adventure under your belt.

Money isn't everything, and I say that as someone in business and finance and working for/with people who would sell their mothers to Satan for a discount/praise. And wealth management is not just in funds but time, effort and so much more.

Keep going and if you need to have a breakdown, have at it.

First they take income tax (easily 20-40%), then lot of canadian pension plan money (which god knows if we will even see 40 years down the line LOL), then each time we buy something, we pay 13% on each item, then property taxes are easily in thousands as well, unless ur renting in which case its alr ggs with more than 40%+ of ur paycheck likely going to that with no ROI either. 

Tbh situation in canada is kind of bleak for young canadians. It feels like government takes so much but provides so little, and is allergic to good policies.

UofT is a big campus that's integrated within the surrounding city - there's pros and cons to that as you could run into anyone, though you would likely run into only people that's in your class or cohort. A good portion of the students just want to focus on school (regardless of their motivations ie. Personal or family obligation). A number of males also do not approach females (especially randomly) for fear of being seen as a creep at best or predator at worse. 

I meann if you want to socialize, you might need to make the effort. If you don't want to put in the effort, then I guess don't socialize? Idk",comment,6

In my entire first degree I never spoke up once in my classes even with participation being 20%, and oftentimes got 60s or 70s in classes because of it (zoom university comments section helped a lot when it came that time). 

Now, in my second bachelors, i am the biggest yapper in class so much so that my classmates are sick of me. They don‚Äôt actually know my back story and how much energy and time it took to gain the courage for me to speak at all, so they think I‚Äôm just annoyingly knowledgeable lol.

The poster appears to be a conceptual diagram about the growth of the Turkish aerospace industry, framed with a religious and global perspective.

Here's a breakdown of the text:

**At the top (in Arabic):**

* **Text:** ÿ®ÿ≥ŸÖ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸÖŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿ≠ŸäŸÖ
* **Translation:** ""In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful."" This is the Basmala, a common Islamic phrase used to begin undertakings.

**Main Title (in red):**

* ""Store of General Hijri in Your Country worldwide""
   * The word ""Store"" might be a misspelling of ""Start"" or ""Story"". ""Hijri"" refers to the Islamic calendar, so this title suggests a global initiative or story tied to an Islamic timeframe.

**The Diagram:** The central part is a graph with two diverging lines, representing growth over time.

* **Vertical Axis (left side):** Labeled ""Turkish Aerospace Industry"" and ""Sius"".
* **Bottom Line:** Labeled with ""TAI"" (which stands for Turkish Aerospace Industries) and has text next to it: ""India-New Delhi Brings on Turkish Aircraft"". This suggests a partnership or acquisition deal with India.
* **Top Line:** Labeled ""Corisus"" (the handwriting is a bit unclear).
* **The Angle:** The angle between the two lines is explained at the bottom.

**Bottom Section:**

* **Title:** ""Angle of:""
* **Meaning:** This section lists what the angle on the graph represents. A wider angle signifies greater success in these areas:
   * Progress; Speed; Market
   * Export | Import; Share %
   * Production; much more

**In summary:**

The poster uses a simple graph to illustrate the rapid progress and market expansion (""Angle of Progress"") of the Turkish Aerospace Industry (TAI). It specifically highlights a deal involving India as a key factor in this growth. The religious heading and the term ""Hijri"" frame this industrial achievement within a broader Islamic or global context.",comment,0

They will be a group of two or more ppl just hanging out in a changing room, waiting to steal cash from your wallet when you take your off your eyes, even for 10 seconds.

Also some guys would walk into your room on a moving day because that is when ppl leave their door unlocked and moving stuff. If they see a wallet or a phone on a table they would grab it. If they ran into you they would just say, ‚ÄúSorry, I thought this was my room.‚Äù And you will never see this person again throughout the semester.

Although I doubt UTSU would allow a club with an age selection and they‚Äôd state it‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù and not ‚Äúinclusive lol‚Äù. 


Don‚Äôt mean to be that guy but let‚Äôs not dwell on the past. I‚Äôm a 7th year cuz I got academically suspended at the end of my second year (failed 3 classes in first year) and took another year off myself to work and rearrange my priorities and change my life around. 

Always remember: 


The past is in the past, and it‚Äôs none of our concern. 


Don‚Äôt be chained and bound by the regrets of the past my friend. After all, the only thing you can do is learn from the past, and try to minimkze failures, mistakes and regrets. You gotta put it behind you and move on, and keep going. 

It‚Äôs not too late to do all the things you missed out on. Extracurrials? Student clubs? Parties? Sports? Friends? Yes all those are great things, but you can still do them after university if you missed out during your university years. 

And we can still do those things in our last year‚Ä¶

But I do feel you and I experienced exactly the same thing. I didn‚Äôt even make any friends the first 3-4 years I was t UofT. Only made 2 ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù and they were older and graduated 2 years ago, and only recently now I met nice, likeminded and cool people I like spending time with, chatting with and talking about life, university, our courses, charging notes, group study sessions etc. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 25 now and value real experiences and genuine connections. And I missed out cuz I was a lesser experienced person at 18, with bad social skills, not confident, shy, awkward, and the pressure of uni got to me.

You‚Äôre definitely not the only one who feels like they‚Äôve missed out.¬†Something that‚Äôs helped me feel less behind is going to some of the drop-in programs at Hart House. They‚Äôre super low-pressure, no one comes in with established friend groups and you start seeing familiar faces week to week. A few good ones to try:


Weekly Social Stop (Tuesdays) with snacks, games, chill space to just meet people.


Get Crafty! (Thursdays) is an easy icebreaker since you‚Äôre making something while you chat.


Queer & Trans drop-ins (if that‚Äôs your community) are super welcoming and affirming spaces.


It‚Äôs kind of like what you‚Äôre describing... people show up open to connection, no pressure to have a big friend group already. If you go a couple times, it really does start to feel like you‚Äôve got your own ‚Äúclub‚Äù of people who are just there to experience campus life together. üíô",comment,1

The core group of friends that I've maintained throughout the years are the people that I study with regularly, thus turning my studying into 'socialization' in a way. It makes studying feel significantly less tiring and a lot more tolerable, where we'll often take our breaks together and leave together afterwards to maybe get a meal or take a walk before calling it a night. If I wasn't able to successfully socialize with my friends this way, I would definitely struggle to maintain my social life.

I also set up days I set aside to work on a given task together with a certain group of people, which also helps me keep on track with my studying. For example, several friends and myself all do research outside of school, so we set aside a day to work together in someone's lab to get a chunk of research work done.

It's easy for people to simply say 'make time', when sometimes, you genuinely cannot make time. Please don't feel like you're somehow behind some curve because you cannot find as much time outside of studies as others, but also make sure to go about your university life in a healthy and maintainable way. Everyone just has to find their own way to make their balance, where for me, its come through my friend group being my study group. Hopefully this helps!",comment,15

Honestly I didn't really have a life until maybe the second half of third year. I think one thing that helped me get a little better at ""having a life"", was almost treating going out with friends *as* an assignment. Like, force myself to make time for at least one or two excursions a week. Basically like taking a non-credit 6/7/8th course :)). It really is all about your mindset.

2) Grades aren't everything. There are lots of programs and opportunities, especially at a place like U of T, even if you don't get into the program/next step you planned for, there'll always be doors for you.

3) ""Having a life"" will help. You need balance, going out and doing things from time to reasonable time is good for you.

4) Take fewer courses and/or an extra year if you have to. I did, it helped a lot. Everyone learns and grows at their own pace, don't let the pressure to be perfect burn you out.",comment,2

Account for your energy, getting a good night's rest, taking care of your body and mind, doing things you enjoy, and having a social life.¬†For me, that means I take 2 courses and work 12h/week. I have enough time for health, hobbies, social life, and 8 hours of sleep most nights.¬†


2. Yap with everyone

Talk to people in your classes. Talk to them during lecture breaks. Talk to them while waiting in line to speak to the professor. Talk to them before and after classes.¬†

What are your hobbies and interests? There's probably a club for that at uoft. Or maybe not, then you get to make your own. Try a bunch out and see what you enjoy. Go to random events on campus that sound cool to you. There's always something to go on campus.¬†



3. Ask people to hang out outside of classes/work

Invite them out for coffee or lunch or studying together at the library or going to one of the many campus events (there are so many things going on campus) or skating at the varsity or [insert any activity]. You need to repeatedly see someone to be active friends. A lot of people will be too busy with grinding at Robarts to spend time with you. But there are people who will enjoy spending time with you and being your friend.¬†


4. Use your resources!

Uoft has so many resources to help you succeed. You can see mental health counsellors, learning strategists, academic advisors, writing instructors, career counsellors, etc. etc. you're paying for it in your tuition, and these are all people who literally get paid to help you succeed.¬†",comment,1

I poured my heart out to this counsellor and told them many personal embarrassing details about my life, because I wanted help so badly, all I wanted were weekly sessions with a therapist or advice on how to get connected to a therapist. In response the counsellor

* \- berated me for not having a recent diagnosis and not knowing weird DSM details like 'what kind of anxiety I have'
* \- insinuated that I didn't need medication because my prescription came from a family doctor and not a psychiatrist, saying, 'he really shouldn't be able to prescribe you with psychiatric medication, it's not in his professional capacity to do so' actually my family doctor is specially licensed to diagnose and prescribe these things, he told me this himself
* \- berated me for not signing up for accessibility services; when I asked how to sign up she said 'it's too late now anyways'
* \- said it didn't seem like counselling would help me because I was 'too busy' with my work
* \- was completely dismissive of anything I had to say, for example, when I told her an example of legitimately terrible bullying I faced in the past she said, 'it sounds like they were just worried about you and didn't know how to react' in a really condescending way
* \- i told her that one of my biggest barriers to getting help in the past was that my parents didn't believe in mental illness (they are much more understanding now though), she responded by basically doing the exact same thing I told her was a barrier to me, reinforcing all of those beliefs
* \- she implied the entire time that I was only at the session to get a free pass out of my academic responsibilities, that was not true, I wanted help so badly
* \- she asked me these super personal questions like 'do you SH' 'have you attempted ...' etc. I answered honestly because I wanted help. I feel like if you ask people questions like that as a mental health professional you are putting them in a vulnerable position, you have a duty to treat them with respect and care, and not be a bully. 

I left the session regretting so much that I had ever gone, and also very stressed that all of my sordid personal information is now permanently on record at U of T in the hands of these people who clearly do not give a darn if I live or die. I cried for the rest of the day basically, because I felt so alone like nothing I did would ever be enough to deserve help or understanding. And this is as a grad student with a direct reference from a prof. I cannot imagine how much worse it is for undergrads and such. I couldn't even tell the prof. why I ended up not continuing with counselling because I was so shook up and it was all very personal, I didn't want to seem like I was complaining or being ungrateful, so that was really awkward because it made me look like I was just blowing them off or being irresponsible or difficult. 

Anyways I just want you all to know that if U of T counselling does this to you, you are not alone, you should treat these interactions for what they are, a way to protect the liability of the university and a bureaucratic process to get you accommodations or referrals, not a way to get genuine mental health help; don't give them too much personal information if that is something you're uncomfortable with being on file at the school. GO INTO THE APPOINTMENT WITH A GOAL IN MIND ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED FROM THEM, MAKE SURE YOUR DOCUMENTS ARE IN ORDER, THAT YOU HAVE INFORMATION AND RECEIPTS TO BACK IT UP OTHERWISE THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING. 

tldr; I am pretty sure if I went up to a random person on the street and trauma dumped they would give me more empathy, advice, and support than a u of t counsellor ",submission,131

I would not worry too much about UofT per se having access to your personal information. I'm pretty sure that confidentiality standards hold at UofT counselling as much as any other counselling service.

I would however suggest that it takes a while to find a competent counsellor who is a good fit for you. It sounds like you got a bad fit, and it is asking a lot to find someone when you need it the most. If you have the bandwidth I suggest you low-key look for someone who \*is\* a better fit so that you have the support you need when you need it. This may require you to look outside UofT, which may make you less worried about confidentiality, but may also cost more than what is covered.

The folks at accessibility services were surprisingly helpful to me, and I recommend getting in touch with them regardless of what process you follow. They'll allow you to register with them even if you don't have a diagnosis, and will help you get a funding to get an official diagnosis if that's what you need. 

As a graduate student, you get $500 coverage for mental health through the GSU. If you are a TA, you have access to the CUPE top up plan, which bumps that to $5000 (union strong!). If you are not a CUPE member, you can easily become one. You only need to work for 15 hours. Those can be exam invigilation in the exam centre.

""Dear Explorer,

You've journeyed far; your quest is almost done,  
To find the treasure, just look where it's begun.  
Return to the spot where your adventure took flight,  
Then glance slightly right ‚Äî keep your head held high.

On the top shelf, a name will appear,  
A great Macedonian warrior, written in the tongue of romance.  
In the pages of Athens, where history entwines,  
Your treasure awaits, in the stories it defines!""

It's signed ""The Great"".

I‚Äôve done that in the past and usually they‚Äôre ok with it unless they‚Äôve got a strict participation rule. Remember that there is UofT time where all classes start 10 minutes after the hour to take into account your exact situation.

Who uses a *narrow, serif* font like that?¬†


Anyway, as an ID card enthusiast and niche hobby consultant, I respectfully submit a few hints. I'm not an authority. I am a mere humble ID card-obsessed fanatic.


So,uh...Pro tips, I guess: a redesign would need to be made way in advance of an order, meaning there are probably a tonne in reserve, and the cost of each card means none are likely to be tossed. Besides: it's a waste of plastic! There are also contracts in place, which create some other barriers to change. But, with preserverence, it could happen.


The portrait preportions are 7:10. I suggest that the box that the photo sits in be removed so that a slightly misaligned photo doesn't clip out of the frame.


The position of the chip in the card cannot intersect with any place where the card printer does its thing, or it will just won't stick. Different vendors make¬†it fun by putting the chip in different locations locations. So the card template needs to allow for maximum compatibility for different batches of cards. Sometimes the chip is hidden on the left side, and other times it's on the top or bottom (sometimes depending on the location of the magnetic stripe on the back). This doesn't apply to the printed template, but does for the text and portrait elements - allow for that!¬†


The colour, size, and contrast in the barcode region cannot change because they need to work with every UT device that reads the cards.¬† UTSC athletic centre? Check. Robarts? Check. I imagine that a lot of consultations happen(Ed) to decide on a barcode standard to use, and changing it would her non-negotiable since changes to this means that the cards might not work on some devices.


So if you decide to explore this with the Innohub or whatever, just keep that stuff in mind. Don't take it personally if there's hesitation to accept any suggestions, or that they'll take a while to appear if it is given consideration. These things rarely move, and then they move slowly. But new ideas rule, so like, have fun!",comment,1

A couple of weeks ago, I posted an orientation event list here, and the amount of support was crazy! That inspired me to turn that into something bigger. Hopefully, this newsletter can help brighten up our semesters and give everyone more reasons to get out there.

I have gathered all the coolest events happening at UofT and made a little newsletter that recommends the most fun/interesting ones!

In my first year, I missed so many events just because I didn‚Äôt even know they were happening‚Ä¶ and honestly, I don‚Äôt want anyone else to go through that. Sometimes we need those random, exciting breaks that make uni actually memorable.

Thanks for all the love so far üíô you guys are the reason I even made this.

It's publishing houses that do that, and they are the ones you should be directing your ire at.

Academics make very, very little off of textbook residuals.  The publishers make most of that money, and they are the ones that push for new editions every few years, not your instructors.  While there certainly are instructors that do push their own books as textbooks, anything that is an actual textbook typically has terrible markups.

For example, on a $100 textbook the bookstore probably only makes $10-$15 on that sale.  The publisher makes the rest, which then distributes a meager portion of that amount to the authors.  And the reason for that is textbooks have an extremely narrow demographic for sales.  They'll get sold maybe 3 times a year, if you're lucky, to maybe a couple thousand students unless it's a super famous textbook in that field.  Textbooks are essentially special print runs with a limited window for sale, to a very limited audience.

Like, yeah... be pissed about the scam of new editions and the prices, but direct that at the publishing companies that refuse to modernize their practices.  It's not your instructors/professors making these calls... it's the publishers.",comment,9

Obviously you should do everything, but if you've done that required work and have no gas left in the tank don't push yourself to the extremes.

Friend-wise, you're going to have to put yourself out there and initiate conversation. If you see a group of people you think you might want to hang out with, slowly worm your way in. Keep doing this daily until you're acknowledged and people know your name. Also, hang out after class, even if it's just for a bit to get food or study in the library. You'd be surprised by how these little activities make a big difference in the long-run. 

Romance wise, if you have a spark with someone and you know they're single, you make time to hang out. Start off as friends and get to know them before vocalizing romantic intentions. People, especially students, want something that doesn't feel like it's work. You message them little things here and there, eventually ask them if they want to hang out one-on-one, then you see where that goes.

In terms of affordable food, I will defend the honor of The Red Truck to the death, especially for their $3.00 tempura hand roll. That value is almost unheard of nowadays in this country. Other places off campus include: 
- Banh Mi Nguyen Huong (Spadina)
- Juicy Dumpling (Spadina)

The hard truth is while you don‚Äôt have to go through this alone, only you can find your way through it. Pull your closest people in ventventvent. It gets better, I promise.",comment,1

\- what gyms are there and which ones are least crowded (and when)?  
\- what do u bring to the gym with you? do u guys bring a change of clothes?  
\- are the changing rooms nice or nah? do u guys also shower there or go back and shower at home?  
\- i heard you cant wear certain kinds of shoes or pants in the gym is that true? what are you allowed to wear?

also like. is there anything else i should know or that im missing? sometimes i see in videos people have some kind of drink with them too, is that just water or like protein shake or something, im not sure?",submission,52

I'd never gone to a gym before but it wasn't intimidating at all. I've done group classes and personal training and enjoyed those too.

\-The whole place is a little bit of a maze. There's a pool, big gym, and several smaller spaces for classes, weights, etc. You're generally allowed to go wherever you want, but you can just ask if people mind if you join. The big gym is my favourite because there are lots of people.   
\-I think only some of the smaller spaces, if any, have AC though, so you should factor weather into your plans until at least October.  
\-They scan your TCard at the front desk so make sure you have it with you.  
\-Bring a combination lock for the lockers. Do not bring valuables to the lockers as I've heard there's lots of theft, (especially at the Athletics Centre). I've never had anything stolen at Hart House but better safe than sorry.  
\-Changing/showering is kinda up to your personal preference. If I'm going home right after I don't shower/change at the gym cause I'd just rather at home.  But if you're doing stuff after the gym and want to feel clean you can change/shower there. Bring your own soap/shampoo; they provide towels at the front desk. Also up to your comfort level if you want to shower naked or in something. The stalls are private with shower curtains.  
\-I've not heard of a real dress code but just wear appropriate gym stuff and you'll be fine. They probably just don't want boots messing up the floors etc.  
\-I like having earbuds to listen to podcasts or music.  
\-I only drink water at the gym. Definitely remember a water bottle! There are several drinking fountains around the gym.  
\-Remember to wipe down equipment after you use it. There are wipe stations among the equipment.

That's all I can think of! It's been a while since I've gone but now I'm inspired. Have fun!",comment,24
2038,can someone please explain how to go to the gym at uoft,ExcellentCapKen,ncaro6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n7vp0o/can_someone_please_explain_how_to_go_to_the_gym/ncaro6q/,1756949495.0,"1. Utsg has 3 gyms: Goldring, Athletic Centre (AC) & Hart House. Goldring is mainly squat racks and free weights, Hart House is mostly machines (but has 2 squat racks), and AC is a mix of the two. I'd assume they're all equally busy, usually around 12-3 and 5-6, and probably pretty unoccupied in the mornings.
2. Just wear gym/athletic attire, bring headphones to listen to music while you work out, and yes, bring a change of clothes.
3. The change rooms are fine but you have to bring your own lock for the lockers. You can shower there, but I personally just shower at home.
4. Hart House doesn't endorse open toe shoes just because it can be a hazard if you drop weights on your toes, so I'd assume the other gyms are probably like that as well. They aren't too strict on clothing otherwise, you can wear jeans and they won't tell you to leave.

Extra: 
-You can bring a water bottle but they have water fountains there.
-If the gym is busy and you want to use a machine that someone is occupying, you can ask them AFTER their set how many more sets/how much longer they intend on using the machine. Most people will be willing to let you alternate and work in with them, but if they don't offer to, they might not rest for long in between sets or are lowkey an a**hole.",comment,13

It‚Äôs really state of the art, the equipment, pool, activities, there‚Äôs drop in sports programs (basketball/tennis/badminton/basically everything tbh), the change rooms are clean, accessible, has day lockers, the showers are super nice, the gym has two floors (I‚Äôm more of a swimmer so I can‚Äôt say much about the gym sorry!) but there‚Äôs also programs that UTSC athletic and recreation department runs like weight lighting for beginners, there‚Äôs women‚Äôs only times for the gym/pool.

So, again swimmer here, but what‚Äôs in my bag is a change of clothes, plastic bags for my flip flops/swimsuit/towel, mini travel toiletries kit for my bodywash/shampoo/conditioner/lotion/skincare/deodorant, a combination lock, a mini hair dryer, hair brush, some extra hair ties.

Many journals don't even require you to declare it if this is all you used AI for in a paper you submit.

As a TA, I don't give a rat's ass if my students use AI. If they tried to get it to do the thinking for them, the assignment rubrics themselves typically catch it, and even when they don't, the fact that the student doesn't actually understand the material will eventually catch up to them in one way or another. 

Even if there is some blatant sign that a student used AI on an assignment, I'm still only going to grade on content unless specifically instructed otherwise because for all I know they just used it to copyedit an answer they worked out themselves. Frankly, a lot of the time this scenario means that my job is easier; say whatever else you want about ChatGPT, but don't tell me its outputs aren't *legible*, which is more than I can say about many students and even some faculty.

We should be treating it like many journals do: if you use AI in your submission, you take on full responsibility for what you've submitted. If your use of AI screws you, tough shit, you used it wrong. If it doesn't, good job, you did it right or you got lucky. It's really your problem, not mine.

Ideally there should be courses or modules or something to guide students on how to properly leverage AI tools, and I imagine those are coming soon. What UofT is doing in the meantime seems like more of its typical gatekeeping behaviour so that it can look cOmPeTiTiVe.",comment,1

I beg the pardon of the moderators if I repost it with some edits. It is long but frankly shorter than falling for a scam.

Welcome, if you are new to the U of T email system you have now joined an email system with literally hundreds of thousands of other people. And you will be receiving so many scam emails that you will be shocked when you get a legit message.

Please look out for the following scams, they are some of the most common.

1. ""Your email is being suspended or discontinued, give your info to us and we will keep it going!"" That never happens. If U of T decides to delete your email they will just be warning you months in advance. There is never a renewal process.
2. Job Opportunity you never applied for: You are offered a job or an application for a job. They tell you it is easy money, only a few hours a week and you work from home. They never tell you what the job is, or specifically who it is for, or if it is named it is for a big name organization that would never actually hire randomly. They want your bank or email info.
3. Offer of any money or scholarship that can't be verified from an outside source. If you didn't apply for that scholarship, or it didn't come directly from your college or department, it is a scam.
4. ""They have your private secret details and will blackmail you in bitcoin"". They never hack into your computer. They have nothing on you. They may list an old password on there to trick you but if they could they would have hacked your bank account.
5. This is your professor. Only email me at this address. I need your help, and by help I mean gift cards.

Signs to watch out for-

1. You don't know the person emailing you. Lots of scammers will use a u of t email to look legit. But google the email. The admin assistant of the department of architecture is not emailing you with a job, they just borrowed her email.
2. Grammar and spelling errors. This is a prestigious school. They can afford auto-correct. Also look for any cash amounts that use USD. We are Canadian, and will only use CAD when talking money.
3. They insist on only that email address. Jobs, scholarships, tech issues, all have an email that can be easily found and a phone number somewhere, and there is often a generic department email instead of a specific person unless you know that person already.
4. They ask for your password or personal info. THE SCHOOL ALREADY HAS YOUR SIN, YOUR PHONE NUMBER, YOUR BANKING INFO. THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK AGAIN VIA RANDOM EMAIL.

Report the emails as phishing with the red flag icon, and delete. Never reply to them, you are just showing them it is an active email and someone wants to engage with them.

Practice safe emailing:

1. If you need to reset your password, share info via email or phone, etc., use only the contact email made available on the U of T website. Or ideally, you go in person and they can talk with you face-to-face.
2. Only access ACORN and other U of T sites, along with your online banking and the CRA, through the actual website, not through email links. This is true even for legit emails.
3. Keep your antivirus software updated on all your devices.
4. If you want to remove your name from the listserv and not receive these emails, you can do so by:

* Search up utorID management
* under ""Make Changes"" select ""change Legacy UTORmail options""
* login and scroll down
* check off ""Do not list <your email> in the directory and hide from the GAL""

Just please use more common sense than your 80-year old grandpa who is falling for a romance scam and you will be fine. Stay safe this year!",submission,50

The first week of class has been really exciting for me - I‚Äôve been saving up for uni since I graduated high school, and dreaming of UofT specifically, so it‚Äôs felt pretty surreal. The campus is beautiful, my classes so far have been interesting and manageable, and I feel I‚Äôm adapting well to the grind of keeping up. 

Since I‚Äôm a bit older, the social element of uni is not a huge priority for me. I‚Äôve lived in Toronto my whole life, went to high school here and made lots of friends, and in the five years since high school I‚Äôve made plenty more - so my social circle is solid already. I live with my best friend in an apartment, we go out with people, I have a boyfriend and he has lots of friends, etc. I‚Äôm also a bartender, which has definitely improved my ability to talk to strangers and ignore my social anxiety. 

However, I‚Äôm struggling to push myself through the social element of school. In a couple of my classes, there have been ‚Äúintroductory activities‚Äù, i.e. turn to the person next to you and chat type stuff, which have been embarrassingly uncomfortable for me lol. I feel really weird talking to 18 year olds. The ‚Äúfriends‚Äù I‚Äôve made in class (I‚Äôve exchanged phone numbers and instas with like 4 people so far, just to have contacts in my classes) are really nice - but again, they‚Äôre 18. I don‚Äôt see myself ‚Äòhanging out‚Äô with them obviously - even studying with them is a weird idea lol. They are having a very different uni experience - they‚Äôre staying on residence, living on their own for the first time, and being‚Ä¶. 18. I have very little in common with them. It‚Äôs especially strange because I look pretty young and could pass for 18, so I‚Äôll immediately be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 23 btw‚Äù, which has gotten some pretty funny reactions. I can tell that they think I‚Äôm like 30, which is honestly kinda accurate compared to an 18 year old haha. Obviously I‚Äôm aware that not everyone at UofT is freshly 18 - there are of course many people on campus who are my age or older. It‚Äôs just difficult to meet them since I‚Äôm taking all first-year classes. 

So I‚Äôve been keeping to myself on campus, which is fine for the most part since like I said, I don‚Äôt feel a pressing need to expand my social circle. But I‚Äôm worried that I may miss out, number one, on the academic benefits of studying and discussing material with people in my classes - and number two, on meeting the many interesting and intelligent people who I‚Äôm probably passing by all the time. It feels a little weird to be having this exciting experience all on my own. I‚Äôve been going on and on to my friends and my boyfriend about my classes, my professors, campus - but they‚Äôre not *there* with me, so it‚Äôs a little unsatisfying. 

If anyone knows of any clubs I could join that provide opportunities for genuine social engagement, lmk - but I do have a full course load, so chill clubs would be good. Even just events on campus where you‚Äôre forced to talk to people, ideally people who are not all first-years. Or if anyone has been in the same spot and figured out how to go about meeting people, lmk. I basically just wanna meet people my age, have people to work/study with, and maybe make some new friends along the way. Feel like a loser writing this post haha. ",submission,47

One thing I‚Äôve learned (even if I haven‚Äôt fully internalized it yet) is to not let the age difference be a source of anxiety. U of T attracts a lot of brilliant, mature students and I‚Äôve been surprised by how often I‚Äôve had really solid, thoughtful conversations with people born in ‚Äò06 or ‚Äò07.

I ended up meeting a few people my age through clubs, and even one through this subreddit. But I didn‚Äôt deliberately look for clubs with older members  I just picked clubs based on genuine interest, and it turned out that lots of undergrads around our age (and even postgrads) were in them too. So I‚Äôd say focus on what interests you, and the right people tend to show up.

Martial arts clubs for example have a few older members from what I noticed, the outing club too. 

Also, even though we might feel older than first years, we‚Äôre not that far off. We‚Äôre not ""mature students"" yet, and we‚Äôre still in the same general life stage so don‚Äôt let that ‚ÄúI‚Äôm 23 and they‚Äôre 18‚Äù mindset stop you from meeting like minded people. This isn‚Äôt high school anymore; uni brings people of all ages together, and soon age won‚Äôt even register unless you‚Äôre in wildly different life stages (which you're not).

And yeah, maybe it‚Äôs more relevant when it comes to romantic relationships, but for friendships, study partners, and just connecting with interesting people? That age gap really isn‚Äôt a dealbreaker at all.",comment,18

As someone who's been through this now twice, I can't say it gets better the older you get. Most people won't say anything to your face, but the moment age comes into question the conversation completely changes.

Ultimately, these are judgements based on ignorance and entitlement. The worst offenders are the ones who think they're geniuses and are using their university experience as an elaborate networking opportunity. Everything to them is about assessing who's ""worthy"" of their time and who isn't. 

It takes time and effort to sift through the bad apples, but don't doubt the real reason why you're doing this: to get a great education for a great job down the line.

If you somehow go through the full program and don't meet anyone who you actually connect with beyond class, it doesn't matter. You already have a robust social circle beyond classes, so anything you get along the way is just a bonus. 

Also, if this is any consolation, many people from cohorts over the years who are having their ""normal"" experience straight out of high school report not making any friends in their first year. Not really surprising given how social dynamics have changed after the pandemic and how cutthroat the first year typically is.",comment,3

You are bound to be late if you are running from John Daniel‚Äôs to OISE or Myhal to Northrop often. It is what it is.

If you are late to a tutorial, TA are most likely permissive of your lateness as long as it‚Äôs in reasonable time and you don‚Äôt disrupt anything. If you are late to a crowded lecture, nobody cares at all. 

Riding your own bike is fine, I don‚Äôt think thefts are that rampant when campus is full of people commuting, too big of a risk. They love striking bikes left at the spot for long in night or early morning instead. BikeShare is always full and often still far from my class between dock so I choose not to take it.

First year was very rough for me as well, but you can absolutely get better if you stick with this.

I think the general advice section (and other sections) in this document I'm [linking](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/30903/mod_resource/content/33/Introduction%20to%20University%20Mathematics.pdf) is excellent for people learning to do proofs, and it took me possibly more than a year to get used to applying all of these. I could have saved myself a lot of time if I learned these lessons sooner. I wrote my finals in my first semester without really being aware of some of these things and struggled a bit needlessly.

You wouldn't learn this in high school probably, but you will be tested as if you knew about it. I think start by remembering this advice, and know what proof by contradiction, contrapositive, etc. are (to the level where you could explain clearly what they are to someone in plain English).

Besides that, I suggest getting to know other students and taking advantage of office hours whenever you're stuck. It's common for students to get help and help each other to finish assignments in a reasonable amount of time.

The fact that you have the grit to focus for 6 hours to do 2 questions is already a sign that you have a good work ethic, which is very important in my opinion. You should try to balance independent hard work (which is important and constructive) and getting some kind of help if you feel like you're going to lose your mind otherwise. Just wanted to suggest this because I spent my first half of my undergrad doing all assignments by myself. I would learn by working very hard to figure things out, but I probably would have learned more if I picked my battles so to speak.",comment,8
2271,"MAT157 is eating me alive, please give me advice on how not to die",rockpotatoez,nd1sl6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nbbifr/mat157_is_eating_me_alive_please_give_me_advice/nd1sl6o/,1757318081.0,"In high school I learnt all of the computational aspects of calculus (differential and integral), but 157 was still not an easy course as I had no proof background (also I think Olympiad type problem solving won‚Äôt really help in Mat157, so don‚Äôt worry about that). It was the second hardest undergrad course I took (the course I enjoyed most though was 257). What follows is my perspective from the specialist program (and having TAed X57 courses).

 - The most important thing you have to do is truly ask yourself whether you‚Äôre in it because you like math (as opposed to something silly like flexing academic prowess). You have to enjoy what you‚Äôre learning if not I really don‚Äôt see any way to succeed in this course.

 - I highly recommend enrolling in the proofs course (Mat138 I think, and Mat102 in UTM). I don‚Äôt think this is ‚Äúmandatory‚Äù for math majors or specialists, but this was the single most useful course I tool in undergrad, because without it, I wouldn‚Äôt have truly understood the basic informal logic hence my 157 would have been shaky (hence 257 etc). I think it‚Äôs important to see basic logic and gain familiarity using examples from basic arithmetic and algebra, rather than being hit by a train with epsilon-delta as the first introduction.

 - Go to tutorials and ask your TA questions (and prof as well of course). Go to their office hours and ask questions. Come prepared (‚ÄúI have a question about ___ specifically. I read ___ from Spivak and tried ___ but I still haven‚Äôt gotten anywhere‚Äù). Go regularly, not just the week of the tests. As a TA, I can‚Äôt express how many times I‚Äôve had weaker students come to me last minute and ill-prepared - no matter how much I try to help, it‚Äôs too late by then. [Edit: Also go to the MLC when it‚Äôs not busy if you can‚Ä¶ I think technically speaking it‚Äôs not for 157, but you can learn a lot from the 137 questions as well‚Ä¶ also there have been tons of times when I‚Äôve been an MLC TA that no one shows up. in that case if you‚Äôre nice about it and you find a good TA there, they may be willing to help].

 - Talk to your classmates about problem sets (but do NOT copy). If you discuss, then make sure you go home and write by yourself.

 - Do several problems from Spivak. For reference: I did about 85-90% of all problems in Spivak (chapters 1-24) and I ended up with a 97% overall. You learn math by reading and doing problems, and Spivak‚Äôs textbook is amazing (and has several interesting problems: eg clever use of bisection arguments, and an outline of one of the original proofs (without MVT) that f‚Äô=0 on an interval implies f is constant, etc).

 - A week before tests I would you look up old Mat157 tests and time myself, because knowing the concepts is one thing but crunching it out under time pressure is another.


I spent lots of time on Mat157 and 240 (originally more for 240 because linear algebra was new to me, but later more for 157 since epsilon-delta is logically more demanding). Sometimes it would take me anywhere from a 0-1h or 3-5h or even up to 2 days to solve a problem (homework or Spivak). So if the amount of time spent is what you‚Äôre worried about, then I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre on track. This is not a course which you can postpone to the day before.


 - Sometimes when I inevitably get tired (after 1-2h) of a given problem and I fail, I move on to a different one. This allows me to clear my mind and try something new. Of course it may happen that I struggle with the other problem too. Then I either return to the original problem or move on to a new one (I usually stick to a max cycle of 3 unsolved problems). Then I repeat the cycle, and there have been many times where failed attempts at one problem nudge you along in another problem which you end up solving, and then that gives you the confidence/insight into solving the original problem. So it‚Äôs all a cycle, and failure is actually a good thing because a failed attempt at one problem could (after slight modifications) be key to another.


I really like this cycling approach as it keeps me sane (especially now when I‚Äôm doing research); of course you can also switch subjects while you‚Äôre at it. 


Finally, let‚Äôs not lose sight of the fact that what you‚Äôre learning now is a concentrated, top-down distillation of a subject, whose essential theorems, organization took a good 250-300 years to perfect (and to recognize the need for such rigorous standards). It took some of Mathematics‚Äô brightest minds, spanning centuries, to achieve this, yet you‚Äôre expected to learn it all in a year. It‚Äôs definitely doable, but don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself if you‚Äôre struggling (some of the early practitioners never figured out the solutions to problems, problems which you‚Äôll, hopefully, be able to answer by the end of the year :)

Hope that‚Äôs helpful (and also reassuring that the amount of time you‚Äôre spending is normal).",comment,7

1. The lecture design is not good. There are some logical transitions that I know because I know them, but are never actually explained. I am not sure how an average student is supposed to get through those.
2. Tutorials haven't started yet. After the tutorial is when you start panicking, but before hope that your confusion will be answered.
3. They don't teach proofs, which is brutal. Find some practice problems online (not HW obviously) (or even the ones we did in class) and feed them to ChatGPT. Then spam it with questions on how to formulate every single detail. Ask ChatGPT to make you some graphs and visualizations or whatever.

1. Say goodbye to friends and a social life. If you're going for it for your program and it's a specific requirement, prepare to make it a time commitment and emotional investment and more.

2. If you want it for the flex, consider psychology (I don't mean this in any insulting way) to see WHY you want it and to understand the rationale because it is brutal. Perhaps by doing that, you can expand your views and see more.

3. If you're going for maths, econ and many others, consider downgrading to MAT137. It feels a lot better (according to friends) to have downgraded and gotten As or Bs than failing or dropping the course.

4. Look at yourself and what you want to accomplish in life. Look at whether this will be a source of pain or regret. Did I get a good grade in it? I did. Do I wish I had downgraded? 1000% and I would trade my A for a shitty B in MAT137 if it meant I could have had better sleep and an easier time in first year.

5. Look at the entire program and pace yourself. The last thing you want is to burn out on one course.

6. Use office hours like the energy drinks you'll be taking in. Annoy the shit out of the prof and TA to learn. They aren't there to be your friend, you're a paying customer getting a service. Use them. I'll guarantee you'll impress them and the prof might open some doors, then forget you within 3 months.",comment,2

7. Rely on AI and Youtube tutorials and tricks. In the UK we learn maths by tackling specific techniques and ""cheats"" to get from equation A to B. Learn them so you can spit them out at any time, because they get very useful.

8. Don't worry about the why. Do it. Get to the core of the steps. Once you have secured the A, then you can have a complete mental breakdown. Alcohol helps (A LOT) after exams.

9. Try looking up A-Levels from the UK, specifically Core Maths, Further Maths, to get a lot of extra tips and tricks.

The textbook is Calculus by Micheal Spivak, 4th edition. However, note that mat157 is more for people interested in pursuing pure math in the future so if you are only interested in pursuing a subject that requires math but isn't just pure math you will not have to take this course as there are easier alternatives. Interestingly enough, high school math barely prepares you for this course so if you're interested in what this course is about you can look through the textbook even without having fully caught up with high school math and I doubt you'll get a different experience from your average new 157 student, especially at the beginning. If it seems interesting but you have no idea how to go do the questions I recommend a proofs textbook like 'How to Prove it' by Velleman before tackling Spivak again.

The truth is a lot of the people taking these courses that do well have a real deep interest in math from an early age. A lot of my peers that did really well were already reading textbooks with proofs and doing them for fun in high school. Some of them were truly just gifted mathematically and could quickly pick it up despite never having seen it before. 

I truly think MAT157/137 are designed for very specific individuals who have a deep interest in math.

If they're not sitting down, but still stationary, you can kinda do the same, but now you need hella confidence, and take into account that you'll probably see them again if you misread her signal.

It's literally one of the easiest skills one can acquire. I was shy and introverted, too. You don't have to be Harvey Spectre-level confident or charismatic, just breathe, don't talk too fast and think before you talk. And don't overthink it, no one is cooler, smarter or better than you. Everyone is self-conscious and nervous; some just hide it better than others. Get out of your comfort zone and try it out.

I'm 25 now, and I've been at UFT for 7 years. From my experience, the student or overall person who can talk, befriend people easily, connect and socialize gets farther ahead than the quiet introverted student with a 4.0 CGPA. The same apples are in the workplace and the dating market. No matter how good, talented, etc., you are, if you don't talk, people don't notice.

It's because there is a human factor in everything, in any job, office, institution, department, and any area of life. levergae it and use it to yoru advanatge. It's as simple as small talk. Find one thing you have in common and go with that and explore that. I've gotten A's in classes strictly because of this. Ofc it is based on merit, but you'd be surprised that if you make people feel good, wanted, and make them feel and sound interesting, and sometimes they truly are, then they would like you and would want to do you favours.

I understand that maybe during class, you might be annoyed or want to pay attention. I was just talking more generally, for context. For the first three years at uni, I made zero friends or connections. And my mental health and social life were miserable.

2. Say ""Hello"" as you sit down
3. See if they start talking about something.
4. If other people are talking, pretend to be curious and add to the conversation
5. Use an actual question about campus or course syllabus or something similar to start a conversation

how does ANYONE know what to do?????? how do you do these readings???? how do you find these clubs??? are there even clubs like hello what is happening??? how do u get involved??? how do u find out what events are happening? parties? hello?? What is happening LITERALLY EVER I AM CONFUSED 24/7 AND EVERYBODY SEEMS SO CHILL AND I LITERALLY AHVE NO IDEA WHAT IM DOING

i am confused to the fullest extent, i have never been this confused in my life. and unsure. highschool was a horrible time for me but i now realize i took the community aspect for granted, we had communal lunches, smaller population, everyone knew everyone, everyone knew the drama and what was happening, events, etc. university is literally every person for themselves. and its a hard adjustment and every night i go to bed and consider seriously dropping out.

and now that im an adult its literally university or nothing. like i HAVE to go through with this and theres no other option, unless i wanna work, idk, cuz id have to work after school anyway; i dont like any of the options for life! uni or nothing or work and thats it forever now!!! elementary days are over and now im on my own and what the FYUCKKKKKKKKKK AM I DOING BROüíîüíîüíîüíîüíî

Or at least not in 1st semester. Make 2 goals: Find your footing academically, and make friends with classmates. Invite people to intentional hang outs for a limited amount of time on the weekend eg brunch, lakeshore run, something like that. If you go drinking, go with them. You will not make good friends by floating at parties aimlessly, you‚Äôll just waste time.if you absolutely must join clubs, do so only as a general member aka no leadership roles‚Äî if you‚Äôre struggling adjusting academically, you don‚Äôt want added pressure of performing for a club group. Just. Find. Your. Footing. In. School. If you‚Äôre ahead on homework, go as a general member to a club event. Next semester or even next year, add something~ a club leadership position, maybe research (bc you focused on academics in 1st yr!), etc. base of everything is school. I know it‚Äôs hard to fight fomo but it‚Äôs so worth it to just get a grasp on school and feel like you‚Äôre winning before you add something else. Other opportunities will still be there next year, trust me. 

Do not drop out. Stop entertaining the thought of dropping out right now. Stop it. UofT open so many doors you really have no idea; even a social sciences degree here can translate into a career in tech sales, research, education, data science, hell even investment banking if you‚Äôre proactive enough and get great grades. 

If you drop out, whatever job you get will probably be your career. Uoft will open your eyes to so many possibilities for life that you may have never even considered or known existed. Optionality starts here. 

Grades are foundation for selection for high paying jobs and for research positions and grad school. You are too focused on Clubs. If you feel you are about to drop out, clubs should be the last thing on your mind. You can do it, just focus totally on academics and any extra time you have do not commit to more things, just find ways to enjoy non-committal things like attending an event / grabbing food with a friend . What you NEED to do is get a hang / flow of school, and take care of your mental health with chill social engagement that doesn‚Äôt ask any more of you. 

1st years always feel like they have to do everything. You don‚Äôt. No one expects you to, you‚Äôre like 18. No one expects you to have your career figured out. Here, your job is to derisk yourself for employers by getting a degree, learn to think critically, discover various paths and see what is good for you in your own time, and above all do what you need to do for you. Not for others, not to look on track/on time, just for you.
I know plenty of varsity athletes that had to leave their sport for like years just to focus on school, only coming back to the team in upper years or grad school. People who entered in humanities and graduated as compsci specialists. Polisci and lifesci majors who work in investment banking. For all of them, being at UofT was critical for being exposed to high performing peers, uncovering opportunities, and proving competence aligned with prestige.

Be kind to yourself, talk to yourself nicely, take care of your health, and work hard in school. By take care of yourself I mean yes social life is strongly correlated with mental health (baby monkeys literally died when given all life sustaining resources but were socially deprived). But do it intentionally, and in a structured way. Get rid of distractions. Just do school + scheduled no pressure fun. Enjoy the process, your time in uni, find pleasure/joy where you can, and add things when you have a hang of your current main task. Good luck, you can do it!!!",comment,43

No future perspective to offer cause I‚Äôm also a first year so we‚Äôll find out together if this just is what it is. Personally I‚Äôm adjusting ok to the academic side of things (humanities student so), but I‚Äôm also a bit older so I feel like that makes it easier kinda. I think a big reason I‚Äôm finding the workload doable is because I‚Äôm not at all focused on making friends and partying and stuff - first of all, I‚Äôve been out of high school for 5yrs, so I had plenty of time to make friends and party. Secondly, everyone in my classes is 18, which is genuinely so horrifyingly young to me (I‚Äôm 23). So I‚Äôm basically just coming to campus, going to class, finding places to do work, talking to no one ever, and going home lol. Makes the workload a lot lighter. If I were you I‚Äôd focus on academics, and make ‚Äòstrategic‚Äô friendship w people in your classes who you can work with (that sounds shitty, but not only is it useful for schoolwork, it‚Äôs also just an easy way to start a friendship that could become more than school-related)

If it makes you feel any better - walking around this place and imagining myself being 18 trying to make friends and figure everything out is HILARIOUS. I would‚Äôve been so lost bruh are u kidding. Thank god I have no interest in making friends with all these kids because they seem to have no interest in it either lmfao - but if I did, I would be so scared and confused about how to interact with everybody. Everyone either has friends (either I guess from before uni or from‚Ä¶ making them here? Somehow?) or keeps to themselves. There‚Äôs like zero interaction between ppl who don‚Äôt already know each other lol. It is very strange - it‚Äôs not just you thinking that

In terms of the whole ‚Äúchill‚Äù thing - can‚Äôt speak for everyone else, but I personally am walking around campus actively thinking:

‚Äújust act chill dude. you‚Äôre chill, you know this shit. you know what building you‚Äôre in and where you‚Äôre going. easy shit. you know this place inside and out. oop, took a wrong turn? no worries man. just look at your phone for a sec and pretend you changed your mind about something. perfect. you know what‚Äôs going on - no worries here. nope. no confusion or discomfort whatsoever, because you‚Äôre chill‚Äù

It might work on the surface tbh. I probably look pretty chill. I am not",comment,3

so for reference i found out that someone from the same class as me commutes using ttc. I saw them today at VMC and didn‚Äôt approach them because my bus was here. I don‚Äôt have their socials or anything (so i can‚Äôt even text them about it) so i was wondering if it would be weird to approach them next week after class and ask them about if they commute and if they would maybe want to ride together. Personally i would love it if someone asked me this because i know how isolating the commute can be but i know it can be a bit strange too.

Let me know becayse i‚Äôm scared it‚Äôs gonna come off as stalkerish or weird. Especially because i‚Äôm a very awkward and shy person‚Ä¶ 

Thanks!

It sounds dramatic but I‚Äôm kinda sick of this. It‚Äôs not even that I don‚Äôt want to be in school. I want to go to uni and get an education but I feel so fucking overwhelmed. Getting a part time job is so fucking hard especially having minimal experience. I just finished year 1 (starting year 2 in a few days). I really just want to work and make real money at a real fucking job literally anywhere that will take me full or part time just fucking anywhere. I hate living off my parents and using their money (they‚Äôre kind of nuts). But I literally just want to make money because I hate being unemployed. I‚Äôve applied online and in person and I‚Äôm literally going in person to ask stores if they‚Äôll take my resume in person so yeah. I‚Äôm really fucking depressed right now and I don‚Äôt know if I can handle going back to class and coming back home applying online and waiting to get rejected or ghosted.

Like I want to continue and get a degree and maybe if I did drop out in a few years when I make enough money I‚Äôll go back and finish. If I did drop out I know I‚Äôd have to repay OSAP and my grants will become a loan and that‚Äôs fine as long as I make enough to pay them back. But it feels helpless not being able to work literally just going back home and not working like it feels useless and like I‚Äôm wasting my time for this degree. Even the degree I‚Äôm doing requires experience for entry level jobs which I don‚Äôt have. I‚Äôm passionate about my degree and want to continue but I don‚Äôt even know if I can.

I‚Äôm in a financially difficult place and it feels like it‚Äôs not worth it right now and continuing this for three more years feels useless. Being the first in my family to go to uni is good and all but idk anymore.

Typically, your best chances of making friends are among people you work with in group projects,  people you repeatedly sit next to in class, or just generally people who you repeatedly see in some context and have a need to talk to. You are very unlikely to just end up making friends with some random dude in the library, for example, or a random person in line.

The key starter ingredients to befriend someone is to see them consistently in a repetitive context, and also have a legitimate need or mutual interest in talking to each other ""exclusively"" in a way. When these two things are met, you have the pre-requisite conditions necessary to make friends. After this it comes down to things like whether you're both sufficiently sociable/friendly or otherwise compatible people in that regard (which usually I would say isn't that much of a problem unless one or both of you are very anti-social or unsociable). This is sort of the ""unwritten/subconscious rules"" on how friends are made and sustained.

My best advice as a 4th year Engineering commuter is to pick one person from one of your group projects or person you sit next to and to just chat with them nicely and exchange socials. The more natural your need to talk (such as being in a group together), the easier it is. Then, on consistent consecutive days, sit with them or talk to them in situations where it's natural to do so. After a while, you will find yourselves naturally gravitating towarde each other in social contexts because youll have more familiarity with each other as compared to with the others around you. Often times, venting about classes or the professor or the class work at hand is the best ice breaker or way to initially bond. I think with this method you shouldn't have too many problems.

I hope that helps.

Edit: If you're in upper years, I would avoid trying to befriend someone already part of a ""clique"" or group of friends. This is notoriously hard to do and has a low chance of success typically as cliques and close friends keep to themselves. Your highest chance is with people who are in similar positions to yourself (people in a new context with nobody they know around, like yourself).",comment,21

Definitely wasn‚Äôt the most social butterfly walking into university but it honestly was so different when I did orientation week.

My advice, that I also plan to follow, is to compliment people, start conversations within tutorials, lectures, etc and look for places we can hang out around campus. Hart House, Sidney Smith, etc those are decent places to hangout.

But referring to my first point, the best way I opened up conversations with people is complimenting something about their appearance. Don‚Äôt fake it obviously, compliment something that actually pertains to you. And even if you don‚Äôt find anything, ask opinion/feeling active questions like ‚Äúwhy did you take this course‚Äù etc etc to other people around you. I did that and ended up getting acquainted with so many people throughout orientation week.

Hope this helps, feel free to dm if you want any specifics!",comment,2

I've commuted for two years now. Its around a 1-1:30hr commute for me.   
  
The best way I've found to be socially open started with attending FROSH or orientation week. If you missed this or chose not to attend, the next best option is group projects or lectures. Lectures can be tough to actually make friends through, I would suggest group projects or anyone you have some sort of 'forced' proximity (via schedule or other things).   
  
I would have to say not to waste your time or be too hung up on trying to be social. I found second year to be much easier and comfortable compared to first year. People are more open, we've already seen familiar faces and likely have contact info from misc interactions. People are also more mature and will often accept any invites to hang out.   
  
If you have downtime I would suggest to join a club or genuinely just message someone / ask if any friends have time off to eat or meet up. Like I said, it doesn't hurt you in any way to send a message or simply ask ;). Worst case scenario, they say no. Best case? You have a bestie.",comment,2

Try and submit an appeal, and gather a plan to present to your academic advisor on how youll try and keep on track, and how they can help you. Your advisors genuinely want to see you do well and succeed so make sure to talk to them. 

And also what I personally did though if your currently on suspension is work or figure out why youre at uoft and if the best method is to transfer schools as well. It may seem scary and feel like youre quitting, but sometimes transferring out into a new environment where you can start over, without ghost of your past haunting you feels liberating.

There is no requirement in basically any degree that you go to every lecture and tutorial, if you have disability-related reasons why you can't.

I‚Äôm an international student with two PhD offers in Mechanical Engineering and I‚Äôd love some outside perspective.

Funding:

Toronto: ~31.5k/year after tax.

Waterloo: With TA + RA, I‚Äôd end up with a bit more than Toronto. Toronto professor also mentioned I probably wouldn‚Äôt have the best chances at extra awards early on since I don‚Äôt have any publications yet.


Research environment:

Toronto: Smaller team, but the professor will be on sabbatical for the first 2 terms and it didn‚Äôt sound like he‚Äôd be very available during that time.

Waterloo: Larger team, professor seems more present.


Lifestyle considerations:

I‚Äôd be moving with my girlfriend ‚Äì she prefers Toronto.

I wouldn‚Äôt get a car in Toronto, but I‚Äôd consider one in Waterloo.

Toronto obviously has a lot more going on socially, but the cost of living is much higher.

Also I got OGS coming in w/o a publication so the chances for awards are there. We also have applications for many MIE fellowship awards coming up. How much more could you make at Waterloo with TA? CUPE 3902 unit 1 makes $53/hour and it‚Äôs not hard to get about 65 hours a term ($2066 of base funding will come from TA so after working about 32 hours you earn the extra money so it‚Äôll be a few thousand if you do 130 hours). We also have minimum RA payments from our supervisors but many professors can go beyond that and pay their students more.

But ultimately it depends on your supervisor. That‚Äôs arguably more important than even your university as they‚Äôre basically your boss for the next 4-5 years",comment,7

I would recommend you not to base your decision on TA, because 
- in MIE there are many many more students than available TA jobs. You may not get it, it's notoriously difficult and the allocation system is sort of broken. It's a lot easier if you work as TA for your boss, but since they are on sabbatical they may not have any.
- Your Phd is about your work and much less about TA (besides sustenance).
- If your boss is not avaliable you may not have a lot of guidance. You'll essentially be on your own for these two years. I would argue it will quite tricky, unless you have an experienced PDF to emphatically guide you.
- University name is very important, but it's not all. Your quality of work is paramount. Decide the project that align with your interests, at a location that serves you better in the long term.


All the best and congratulations on the offers :)",comment,2

You will quickly make up the difference in PhD stipend during your first years with a job afterwards. Honestly, even if you needed to take out a small loan to support living costs during your program, it‚Äôs worth doing to attend a better program. The goal of a PhD is to train you up to do research and hence help prepare you for a career. So, what matters is how the programs would affect your future career prospects. What do you want to do post PhD? I would talk to current students at each school and look at their alum placements to try to figure out people‚Äôs job prospects after each program and which is more appealing to you",comment,2

Waterloo is better for you academically and financially. As you mentioned, it's a larger team, and the professor is more accessible, with living costs being much cheaper in Waterloo compared to Toronto. 

Pros: Lower living costs, Prof seems more  present,  

Cons: Less networking opportunities, fewer social activities(boring), might have to get a car so that in(insurance, gas, maintenance), larger research team (not necessarily a good thing, and you might spend less time with the Prof since his time is divided between a larger team)

UofT:

Toronto would be a better social and networking environment, and it would look better on your resume. UofT has more prestige than Waterloo after all, irrespective of the program. Especially for exploring jobs outside of Canada (e.g., the US, UK, etc.). 

Pros: More networking opportunities and more social activities(not boring), UofT's prestige/name, world recognition and reputation, do not have to buy a car, smaller research team(more opportunities to learn, connect and more time spent with the professor ideally) 

Cons: Higher living costs, the prof is not as available/present. 

  
Both are objectively ""good"" options and great universities. Factor in the pros and cons of each and see what you prioritize. I'd personally choose UofT, and I might be biased, but I value the city, activities, social life and the prestige of UofT and the name. I mean, being the only Canadian university that ranks top 25 globally year in and year out means something..",comment,2

Would it be feasible to move to Toronto area with your girlfriend and transit or drive to Waterloo if needed ? Does your girlfriend have a job or is she studying or just living with you. Toronto has a lot more opportunities for social life, international food/culture and meeting people and otherwise.

I know a lot of my PhD friends moved out of the university area after 1st year as after first year a lot of the work is independent research based. A lot of them also work part time and then complete the studies. 

You could also move to Waterloo for the first year then move out.",comment,1

Overall UofT has a lot more reach, exposure and better rankings, prestige and reputation on the world stage, than all other Canadian universities. 

This is for 4 reasons: 

1. UofTs level of research output, quality of the research, groundbreaking nature of it and scale of it. It‚Äôs a research intensive university and almost all professors are published in academic journals and are actively doing research. In fact it‚Äôs much more research oriented and focused than teaching focused‚Ä¶

2. The name. After all it‚Äôs named after Canada‚Äôs biggest and most popular city. Anyone in the world knows Toronto, but not everyone knows of Waterloo, London ON, even Montreal and Vancouver aren‚Äôt on the same level as Toronto in terms of international recognition and fame. 

3. Quality of the students. It has some of the toughest and highest admission requirements, especially for its graduate schools, programs and Med school and Law school. The students that get accepted are the very best of the best. 

4. Majority of UofT professors are Ivy league or Oxbridge alumni and the rest taught at those institutions. In fact UofT has the most Ivey league or Oxbridge alumni professors out of all Canadian universities.",comment,1

90 hours would be say two one-hour tutorial every week plus around 30 hours of grading (say split into short weekly quiz grade plus one 15h midterm grading)plus invigilation plus a bit of training. This adds up to more like 75h but you got the idea.

If you want to make more you can work in the summer semester as well. It's comprised of two terms where courses are often read at double speed so you will still have some vacation time too.
You can lecture after say year 3 or around that time. Being a lecturer for a semester is equivalent to 180h of pay (or used to).
It's more of a hassle if you are a coordinator as well, so choose wisely:)
