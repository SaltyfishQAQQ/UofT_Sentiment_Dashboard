They know exactly how many students need these required courses but somehow always underestimate tutorial/lab capacity. 

Pro tip: have backup plans for every single course, especially the required ones. Check if there are alternative sections at different campuses or times that might work. Also worth emailing the department directly sometimes they'll open more sections if enough people complain.

The whole system needs an overhaul tbh. I actually help students navigate this mess through course planning consulting because it's gotten so ridiculous that people need professional help just to graduate on time.",comment,2

If there really are not as many tutorial spaces as lecture spaces, this is an issue that they will, ideally, fix before the term starts. This is likely just an Acorn error; they would not actually make it so that there aren't enough tutorial spots for everyone in the lecture section.",comment,3
