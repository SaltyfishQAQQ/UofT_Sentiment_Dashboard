Acorn is down because it‚Äôs general enrolment, it opens at the same time for everyone so everyone‚Äôs trying to get into the courses they want.

Unfortunately it sucks and the school does not want to pay for more load capacity on acorn.

If it‚Äôs a program requirement, I believe you could be granted an exception to be put into courses regardless.",comment,5

That's literally so dumb, just make it different times to be safe.
