This change really tanked my GPA, and it’s currently at 2.0, which I know is horrible. For my master’s, I’m considering a Master’s in Finance, but I don’t want to go straight into a master’s program—I want to get a good job first. So, I was wondering: should I really care about my GPA? Or should I switch to a political science major and do a math minor instead? I’m so confused. Do banks in Canada, like CIBC, care about GPA and what you major in after graduation? I’m so scared that for the past week, I’ve only been getting three hours of sleep each night thinking about this.",submission,14

I just networked like crazy, and proved that I have the certifications they wanted. (Edit 2: it was an entry level position, salaried, but entry level with upwards movement based on tenure and performance. I also had multiple friends who already worked there. So again, please do take this as a grain of salt. But I hope to offer some sort of fact-based comfort nonetheless). 

So, make sure you network as best as you can & have a good repertoire of internship/work experience and you’re good! (Edit 3: but of course, having a degree is WAY better bcs further certifications require you to have a bachelor’s OR at least 3-4 yrs of experience, think CFA or CPA)

Also, if you are thinking about doing investment stuff in Finance, make sure you get either your CSC or CIFC as well

Edit: lastly, most people don’t even put their GPA on their resume nowadays anyway. (At least that is what I heard from my friends who work in recruitment and HR).",comment,9

Benefit of working in a startup is that you get to literally look over the shoulder of leads or hiring managers etc of the candidate selection process. 

When a job gets posted on linkedin or w/e, these people in charge of hiring gets thousands and thousands of emails. They are human beings just like us, and they'd rather have someone in the company refer someone to come in for an interview. 

Bottom line is, GPA does not relate directly to your desirable career path, but networking and referrals certainly have a big impact. 

High GPAs will get you internships at banks, and this experience gets you noticed if you were to apply for a full time position in that company or else. 

Even if you don't land your first job at the big banks, it is very common for people to easily transfer to bigger banks or corporations with a few years of experience at a smaller company because you would get referrals from your coworkers or seniors. If you perform well. 

And I'm not sure which year you're in, but like others have said, last 2 years GPA are only relevant. Graduate schools do not account for your first 2 years GPA. 

To build a network, attend seminars and workshops. Grab as many business cards as you can from speakers in these events. Smile a lot when you see them, leave a good impression. This will get them to remember you and look at your resume in a pile of thousands and hopefully call you in for an interview. 

I had below 2.0 GPA prior to year 3, got suspended twice. I had to write a 10-page appeal letter after 3 years for U of T to take me back in. I took responsibilities and had a 3.7 GPA in year 3 and 4. I got admitted to a Graduate program but I had an offer from the company i'm working in right now and I'm glad I made this choice. 

Otherwise I'd be sitting on thousands of dollars of student loans debt lol. 

Good luck in your program. Math is still a practical program and will get you jobs, its a matter of time and effort from your end.",comment,3

I think it really depends on what you need for your masters. IF the masters in finance programs would require you to have a better GPA (or at least show that you are constantly improving yourself), maybe it would be better to switch your major to increase your GPA. (For this one, I can't exactly say much since I have never looked into getting a masters in Finance, apologies :( ).

As for your second question, from what I see in my old colleagues who are thriving right now, none of them have a degree in math or finance related. I think only one of them had a bachelor's degree and it was in engineering. Most of us have some sort of college diploma either in business or something else, but have above and beyond certifications related to the field. (Keep in mind that we all entered from an entry level position and moved either up or laterally within the span of 1-3 years)

However, on the recruitment side of things: I could see that having some sort of strong math background or minor in math could be a plus during the hiring process (depending on the nature of the field in Finance you want to do).

I used to work more in the investment side of things, so I remember that they put more of an emphasis of having the proper certification (CSC/CIFC), knowledge in investing (generally the laws and regulations), etc rather than the actual degree in, say, financial management or something.

I hope that this helps! :)

EDIT: grammar, im sleepy lol.  
EDIT 2: So... I probably would vote for switching to Poli Sci major + a minor in maths, perhaps a minor in stats? The maths at uoft seems to be very proof based, and maths in finance tends to be application based.

(also, please take care of yourself. Tl;dr, in my experience, especially if you are willing to work your way up, no one pays attention to your GPA.)",comment,2
