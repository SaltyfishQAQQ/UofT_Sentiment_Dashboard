Why are most UTSU events just full of delusional bs?,zeptabot,1m6oijr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m6oijr/why_are_most_utsu_events_just_full_of_delusional/,1753214547.0,"I went to this ""End Of Year Celebration"" in May and went to this workshop called something along the lines of ""Values of your international experience"". where some guy with a bachelor of teaching using cringey self-degrading jokes and some other guy who studied some kind of humanities made a big gesture to announce their pronouns along with their names, and started with some kind of activity where they have us draw our ""tree of skills"" on a paper and present to the room as a group.

I think two Asian girls left on the spot. And afterwards the presenters got absolutely roasted when they are trying to go along the script talking about ""intercultural competency"" and ""international experience are valued by employers"" while one girl brought up her friend from another country who used to work as a family doctor but could literally only wash dishes and some other guy mentioning he sent 140+ applications without a recieving single interview.

The whole experience made me feel surreal as if I just watched an The Office style sketch that's meant to be cringey.

The difference is that The Office has actually good writing, while what happened there that day is just sad.

I feel like all those ""events"" and ""workshops"" for social, well-being, housing, development, etc. like this one workshop called ""Why Can't I Focus?"" is uselss, run by underpaid humanities / social science graduates who are full of delusional bs and toxic positivty, which is probably just for show and they don't actually believe it anyway. So what's the point? Why is our funding & tuition money going these bs initiatives?",submission,69

I'll never understand why people believe this. Odds are like 99.9% that anyone who is looking at your CV or interviewing you went to university. They know what student unions and student clubs are. Is anyone at university impressed that you're in a student union or club? Then why would anyone be impressed by that on a CV? Would the people saying this be impressed by that? For the most part it's very unimpressive except for a few technical clubs that actually compete or do stuff that demonstrates hard skills.

 You're telling me these longstanding national, provincial institutions and regulatory bodies haven't figured out a way to transfer medical qualifications or create a framework to assess internationally trained medical doctors' credentials, especially from non-western countries, because  it would take too much time to figure it out and simplify the process?    

 You're naive because you think this system is working fine and internationally trained medical doctors just need to be more positive and learn more intercultural competence skills while they deal with barriers to re-credentialing, created by the institutions, for medical professions and specialities they are already trained to do. 

It's because of these bureaucratic institutions' laziness, and greed frankly, that internationally trained medical professionals are washing dishes or driving taxis instead of getting into medical practice and jobs in Canada where they could continue to apply and enhance their medical skills by helping Canadian patients. Because if internationally trained doctors get their credentials effectively and efficiently after they arrive in Canada, then how will UofT, Royal College, and CPSO make money off the backs of international professionals. 

Also, if all internationally trained medical professionals are able to get through a simplified re-credentialing process to assess academic rigour, medical certifications, and job qualifications without having to complete their entire medical degree again in Canada, they would have the opportunities to enhance their medical skills to respond to the market demand changes in medicine that in your mind are so ""drastic"" it justifies professionals not having medical jobs they are actually trained to do. 

But hey, for you, the institutions aren't the problem, its the internationally trained medical professionals and international students who aren't taking the intercultural competency sessions and are only asking for support from their university to find jobs, to you know, live and be productive members of Canadian society. Next time before posting another counter argument so stupid, practice some self-awareness and gain some perspective; you could also benefit from this thing called intercultural competency. 👀",comment,2
