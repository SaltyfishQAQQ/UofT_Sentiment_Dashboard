Anything you managed to glean from an all-night study session is negated because you need sleep. Sleep is how your brain moves the info from short-term to long-term memory and is necessary. 


Similarly, instead of trying to cram 8 hours of studying before the exam, do small chunks throughout the semester. There really is no cheat aside from consistency. But some stuff to help be consistent is studying with others (body doubling)  learning if you study better on the morning or evening, etc. ",comment,21

Even if it’s a math class and you’re a psychology major, you worked hard to get there. Practicing gratitude for yourself and the class allows you to create the space to effectively study. 

2) You’re going to remember by making as many connections as you can. It’s really never been about direct memorization but about breaking it down and making sense of all the parts. So it’s not necessary about learning a single slide or single lecture, but figuring out how it finds into the larger concept. This is why a lot of people choke on exams. It also helped me a lot to rewrite the notes in my own words by hand. If you do this every week after the lecture, you have to study minimally for the exam.

3) Do past exams or scan past questions by joining previous cohorts’ groups and go to midterm/exam time. Usually there is at least a few hard questions that are the same. It helps you the gauge what the professors are looking for.

4) If you have time and feel ready, help others. This always helped me understand and consolidate the material better. Also made great friends this way.

5) Prioritize sleep and physical health as much as you can.",comment,5

**(I developed these strategies after trial and error, and now I'm in my 5th year and have been getting As regularly for the past 2 years)**

Here are some of the most effective strategies I've learned during my time as a Political Science and History major. Some are common sense, some are a bit more unconventional, but they've all been game changers for me. **These are 8 tips to help you:**

**1. Read the Instructions. All of Them.**

This sounds obvious, but it’s the most critical first step. Before you do anything else, you need to read the syllabus from head to toe. It contains everything: extension policies, assignment guidelines, and grading schemes.

More importantly, read the specific instructions for every assignment, midterm, and final exam. Professors, especially in 100 and 200 level courses, are often very detailed in their assignment and test guides and instructions.  Pay close attention to the wording. I once saw a classmate get a terrible grade because they wrote a standard essay for what was supposed to be an analytical critique paper comparing two articles without a traditional thesis. They missed that crucial detail in the instructions. The syllabus and assignment guides are your roadmap; don't ignore them. This might sound cliche, but it's a simple way to do better in the class.

**2. Active Listening > Robotic Note-Taking**

Don't try to transcribe and type every single word the professor says during a lecture. I always see students typing even when the professor goes off-topic or tells a joke or talks about their personal life, etc. To me, this suggests they're not listening or, at the very least, not actively absorbing the information. They're like robots, just typing, but not listening.

The goal is to actively listen. Engage with the material as it's being presented. Only write down the most important things: key facts, names, statistics, dates, or concepts you know you might forget. Often, a professor's tone of voice will change, or they’ll outright say, ""This might show up on the midterm, or this is super important,"" that's your cue to write.

**Here’s a great test for yourself and the best principle in academia and university:**

**After a lecture, can you talk about the main concepts for 5-10 minutes in your own words? If you can't, you haven't truly understood the material!! If you can, you can ace the class.**

**Pro-Tip: Use a Pen and Paper. Countless studies show that taking notes by hand improves comprehension and memory. Plus, a laptop is a major source of distraction. Let’s be honest, it’s easy to get sidetracked by notifications or the temptation to check Instagram. Old-school pen and paper keep you focused.**

**3. Record Every Lecture (Your Secret Weapon)**

This tip is a game-changer. Ask for permission first, but if not, I've found ways to do it discreetly with my phone or laptop. Sit closer to the front to get clear, crisp audio. This frees you up to actively listen in class (Tip #2) and provides a perfect record of the lecture for later reference. This way, you're not stressed about missing key facts and details and can actively listen.

You can take more detailed notes later that day or on the weekend by listening to the recording...

And this can save you for midterms and finals, where you feel like you don't know anything and panic. You can just listen to the lectures again...

Office hours with your professor and TA are there for a reason. Don't go in expecting them to re-teach an entire lecture. Instead, use that time to ask specific questions. If a concept from a reading is unclear, or you want to discuss your approach to an upcoming assignment, they are more than willing to spend 10-20 minutes walking you through it. This can provide immense clarity and show them you're engaged.

**Secret Universal Tip (THE HUMAN FACTOR)**

**There's a human factor in every class, course, university, department, company, business, and virtually all facets of society. Leverage that and expose it. Use it to your advantage. If the prof and TA know you exist and know your name... that's a huge plus. Then, when you need that 1-2% grade boost, or midterm or assignment regrade, they will take that into account. As much as professors and the university claim that marks are merit-based and objective, there is a human element and subjectivity involved.**

**When I regularly went to office hours, talked about the lecture, readings, and even real-world events and topics, I befriended the professor or TA, and in those courses I got a higher mark, as opposed to the same courses where I put in the same amount of energy and effort.**

**6. Access ""Secret"" University Resources**

These are two resources that even upper-year students sometimes don't know about:

**The Exam Repository:** At U of T, there's an online repository of past final exams. You can find exams from your course from a few years ago to get a feel for the format and the types of questions your professor asks.

**The Syllabus Repository:** This is gold. If you can find a syllabus for your course taught by the same professor from a previous semester or year, you have a massive advantage. Professors rarely change their syllabi year-to-year. This means you can get a head start on the readings, see the assignment topics in advance, and plan your entire semester.",comment,2

As a humanities student, essays are my bread and butter. Here’s my entire process:

**Start Early:** Even if an essay is due in two months, read the instructions on the day you receive them. Highlight the word count, citation style, and key requirements. Brainstorm topics. This initial step prevents the last-minute panic that can harm your grade. It also gives you time to brainstorm ideas and truly ""think"" through the assignment. Starting a research essay a week before it's due is already too late.

**The 70/30 Rule:** Spend 70% of your time on research and outlining, and only 30% on writing.

**The 70% (Research):** This isn't just about finding sources. It's about building your entire argument. This stage includes: formulating a thesis, finding high-quality articles, refining your thesis based on your research, and creating a detailed outline with your main arguments and evidence, quotes, paraphrased and summarized portions (with page numbers!).

**Going back to Notebooklm:** this is where it comes in handy for papers. You upload all the scholarly journals you've found from the databases you searched. Upload them into the notebook for the course, then select only the sources for the essay and the essay instructions sheet, and write your topic and thesis. Afterwards, you can ask for help to refine and improve your thesis based on the sources here, or ask which sources are most suitable and can support your thesis. It’s a great way to scan and filter through peer-reviewed articles or chapters from this book to find the most useful for your thesis, and even request it to find relevant parts (quotes with page numbers).

**The 30% (Writing):** Once your outline is solid, the actual writing is surprisingly fast. You can even write a 3,000-word essay in 5-6 hours if you've done the heavy lifting and have your sources, quotes with page numbers, and overall outline ready. I often write my body paragraphs first and save the introduction, conclusion and formatting and editing for last. 

**Formatting & Citations Matter (A Lot):** Proper formatting, citations, grammar, and punctuation can usually account for up to 30% of your essay grade. Nailing this is one of the easiest ways to boost your mark.

**Use the Right Tools:** To perfect that final 30%, a tool like **Grammarly Pro is essential.** It goes beyond a basic spell check to review your tone, style, punctuation, and even the accuracy of your citations. It also includes a plagiarism and AI checker, making it a valuable final step before submission. **DO NOT use the generative AI feature, it includes, cuz that's basically using AI to write, but use it for editing, correcting your grammar, tone, style, punctuation, and to find synonyms and fix sentence fragments and using too much passive voice.**",comment,2

**Never Skip Lectures:** You can't get by on readings and slides alone. Lectures are where professors provide context, give examples, and expand on dense topics, and it's easily 80% of the learning. A student who attends every lecture will almost always outperform a student who skips but does all the readings.

**Go to Tutorials:** Tutorials often count for 10-15% of your final grade. That's the difference between a B+ and an A-. But it's not just about attendance; it's about active participation. Ask a question or offer an opinion. That's how you get full marks and easily boost your overall grade. And the majority of the time, TAs mark your assignments, tests, and exams, so showing up and participating has a significant impact due to the human factor I mentioned earlier. This holds true more for assignments than tests, since essays tend to be subjective in grading and not entirely objective. A professor or TA might give a paper a 75, but another might give it an 81... So show up. The same is true for Lectures, especially in 300 and 400 level courses when classes get smaller and professors know all students by name...
