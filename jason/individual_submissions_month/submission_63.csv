I‚Äôm on a budget so I‚Äôm hoping to find a cost effective way of eating, that also doesn‚Äôt take too much of my time. Do you guys have any recommendations or advice?",submission,16

I have some tips from cooking for myself: (in no particular order

- if i put in the effort of making something nice, i make two portions and freeze one for later

- find a good protein and carb source, for me it‚Äôs TNT chicken drumsticks (it‚Äôs the cheapest i‚Äôve found) and pasta/rice (also pretty cheap), stick to those and do varieties as an added bonus

- get the veggies you are ok with eating raw, cuz sometimes life happens and being able to eat without opening the stove is a big plus

- TNT sauces are absolutely a godsend, especially the chinese pickles and sauces that are more like a chili, you can ‚Äúmake‚Äù a meal very fast by just taking said sauce and mixing it with rice/noodles/pasta (although slightly less healthily) if needed",comment,23

2. Cook in bulk
3. Freeze the extra

Example: I like noodles and chicken. So I buy them in family packs and cook at once and freeze for the rest of the week. Works great. The whole cooking time takes 30 mins and I do it once or twice a week. 

I have been doing this and saved a ton. Go to discount groceries like TNT or No frills. For me, it was hard at the beginning but once you cook a few times, you will be golden. Good luck:)",comment,5

Also, rice and tortillas are lifesavers for carbs since you can make an endless amount of meals with them. Also, find some cheap and good marinades or sauces that you like because they can help make meal prepping easier while keeping the food delicious. There‚Äôs also just mooching of the meal plans of friends since they are very hard to finish.",comment,4

It's really important that you avoid fast food and god forbid Uber Eats cause they add up fast. The best thing someone can do is go to the Walmart and buy the cheapest things like ramen packs, box macaroni and bread (at least that'll be my plan for my second year)",comment,1
