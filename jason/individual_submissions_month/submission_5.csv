Focus on your grades and gpa and try to find friends and built a social circle. 

As for everyone else, it‚Äôs al noise. There‚Äôs an idea called signal to noise ratio by Steve Jobs. 

In your waking hours 80% of your tasks should be signal and signal I what needs to get done today, priorities: like work, studying, exercising, to do list and Important things you have to finish TODAY. 

Noise: everything else, goals, future plans, social life, miscellaneous tasks, thinking what other ppl are doing and comparing yourself with them. 

Once you do this you get closer to the goal daily and actually accomplish a lot and before you know it you reached that goal. 

Take university for instance. If you think about the fact that you need 20 credits to get your bachelors and this gpa and to make POSt if you haven‚Äôt for example, and etc etc. You‚Äôll always be stressed, have anxiety, fomo and think about what other people are doing. and procrastinate cuz you‚Äôre full of noise and your mind is thinking about the noise. 

Cut away all the noise. 

And there‚Äôs millions of differences between each person, and no one is the same. Everyone‚Äôs environment, background, personality, work ethic, social circle, network, connections, luck, circumstances are different. 


I can tell you from firsthand experience and seeing this with my own eyes time and time again don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre behind and other people are doing better than you. 

Majority of students that have a great empty resume are not that bright and it‚Äôs a lot of fakery, imitation and fooling people going on. 

I have several friends at UofT, that if you go on their linked in profile and other social media you‚Äôd think they‚Äôre CEO of chase bank or chairman of the federal reserve or a billionaire entrepreneur or ceo of Fortune 500 or a world leader in politics. 

But they‚Äôre failing university, have no routine or schedule, wake up at noon, and they‚Äôre doing so many universal things that ‚ÄúLOOKS‚Äù nice and productive and that they‚Äôre successful but it‚Äôs all for LOOKS and it‚Äôs all noise. 

At the end of the day see why your goals are and focus on them. Is it grad school, law or medical school? Focus on your gpa and boost your grades as much as you can cuz that‚Äôs 70% of what matters. 

You‚Äôre a university student and your job is the university and studying. That‚Äôs the priority. Any extra time you have, join student clubs, university events, job fairs, grad school fairs, build your resume and update it and apply to a dozen jobs a week. But again that‚Äôs secondary right now, priority is great grades. 

I used to think like you but once I set goals with a ‚Äútimeline‚Äù and ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù and broke it down into steps, then I‚Äôm 80% signal daily. And get closer to my goals daily. 

And I never think about other ppl or if they‚Äôre doing better than me, what‚Äôs popular, trading, or try to copy and emulate them. Cuz I have my goals and know what it takes to achieve them and get there and I‚Äôm on track. 

The reason you feel this way is because you might not have a well defined goal, plan or end result you want to achieve badly, and strive towards daily. 

A goal without a deadline, timeline and plan is only wishful thinking and lying to yourself. Break the goal down and tell yourself what does it truly take, what actions do I need to implement, what habits to develop and what to do daily to get increments closer to that result or goal. Then implant the signal to ratio daily, you don‚Äôt have to do 80% signals and 20% noise that‚Äôs just an example, do 70/30 or 60/40.

And you be so busy and productive that you won‚Äôt even have time or energy to think about others and work lent care less what they‚Äôre doing or are up to. 

Have a sense of urgency but with yourself and your life, not against someone else and what they‚Äôre doing. Believe me a lot of your peers and ppl you see that have it all figured out, don‚Äôt have shit figured out. They‚Äôre just trying so many different things at once and hope one sticks, only difference is they‚Äôre doing and taking action, even though that action is without planning, and all over the place, which can help them, hence the linked in profiles with dozens of accreditations, certificates, volunteer and student club experiences that 99% of employers don‚Äôt care about and they care about your degree, REAL WORLD work experience, not being the head of a student club, and some care about your gpa (if it‚Äôs hyper competitive and they ask for it).


Also having great people around you is key. Friends are overrated if it‚Äôs just fake friendships and wasting your time in social circles. Pick and choose the people you associate with carefully and asses if they‚Äôre value to your life, if they‚Äôre genuinely good people, if they have the same values and principles. 

You truly are the average of the people you hang with‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a cardinal rule and fact. 

But friendships and being social can‚Äôt be forced. Let it come to you and it‚Äôll happen naturally. Just be open to socializing and communication and try to network and connect with classmates in lectures, tutorials and another great way to meet friends and intervening people is at the gym or any event the university offers.


Final tip: 

1. Update your resume monthly and make tweets to it and make it A.I. optimized I forgot the correct scanning algorithm but majority of businesses and employers use A.I. to scan resumes for what they‚Äôre looking for, whether that name be. This is cuz they get hundreds of resumes and it makes it easier, albeit cold and heartless and they might miss bright candidates doing this. 

2. Go to office hours a lot and create a relationship and somewhat friendship with your profs. Try to do research with them or work with or volunteer for them. 2-3 reference letters from profs is worth an entire linked in profile and all the jargon you see on there. 

Become friends with your profs essentially and before you know it your circle is intellectuals and people that can add value to your job prospects.",comment,29

And guess what there are plenty of people doing the same and I‚Äôm sure uve ended up in another‚Äôs persons mashup of the impossible standard don‚Äôt believe me ask anyone especially those in this list of people who you think are ‚Äúsucceeding‚Äù and i promise you they will mention another person who is succeeding in a trait that they don't have.
anyway here‚Äôs what helped me when i felt like this. pick one goal. literally just one. it doesn‚Äôt have to be some crazy thing like ‚Äúbuild an app and get a job at google.‚Äù it can be like ‚Äúfind someone to build a project with‚Äù or ‚Äúapply to 3 internships this month.‚Äù and then u gotta say it out loud. to someone. tell a friend, dm someone, idc just say it. once u say it out loud ur kinda forced to follow through.
and try to find someone who‚Äôs in the same spot as u. someone who also wants to start something but doesn‚Äôt know how. u don‚Äôt need a mentor or whatever, just someone to push u a bit and for u to push back. that part is huge. accountability changes everything. u just need one person that‚Äôs all it takes.
also and this might be the most important thing... get off reddit/socials for a bit. no hate to this app i‚Äôm literally on it rn replying to u lmao but fr the dopamine loop is real. u see all these replies, feel inspired for like 5 mins, then nothing changes. then u look for another post. and another. and ur not living ur life anymore, ur just watching other ppl live theirs
so yeah. ur not a failure. ur just in the fog right now. and that‚Äôs fine. everyone goes thru it, some just fake their way out better than others. but the fact u were honest abt it?? already makes u diff from like 90% of ppl who just suffer in silence pretending they‚Äôre good
start small. tell someone what ur gonna do. find one person to do something with. log off a bit. ur not stuck forever i promise. It‚Äôs not a race , its not a competition making it a competition will only result in failure, set a routine for yourself start now not tomorrow not another day.",comment,10

* time box your studying so you're not thinking about others
* you dont really know how others peoples lives are, imagining anything beyond their performance in undergrad is just inviting more destruction in self esteem
* consider volunteering, no cost but at least you're doing something for others instead of bashing yourself 

>  i do wanna work on projects and apply for internships but i have no idea where to even start?

look at job postings, see what skills you can pick up and time box your studying. Network and go to events, unless someone is actively helping you out with a job you are going to have to do things yourself. We all go through the adult life culture shock you just got to keep going at it a bit day by day.

And I resonate with this despite others saying that I've got life figured out, presumably because of my grades/work/research experience. 

I guess my point here is that it can often seem like the people around you are doing great, but I will guarantee you, a good amount of them feel the same kind of uncertainty and stress and anxiety that you do. I know I do. I'm going to be a hypocrite here (and it's especially hypocritical because I know what I'm about to say is easier said than done), but life really is a lot nicer when you focus a little bit less about how others are doing, and focus a bit more on how you're doing. And once you prioritise yourself, it becomes a tiny bit easier to put your head down and grind--whether that be for school, research, or projects for internships.

When I started going to uoft for engineering, it was hell from the start. Everyone was already miles ahead of me even though I JUST started university; they all knew what they wanted to become, they already were involved with so many clubs and leading/directing so many events, while i was trying to figure out how to go from one class to the other. Even though at first it was rough, I endured it because I told myself ""I'll eventually do these stuff as well and become an academic weapon"".  
Second year came and I did my best to be active in the school society like everyone else: join a few clubs, apply for few directorship positions in some events, and try to be a good student and person who'll help everybody else. The breaking point came when I was doing all of these activities, overloading myself with work and sleep deprivation, but still I couldn't catch up to anybody. even though I was actually making an effort it was useless. I started falling into depression, academically fell, and physically got out of shape too.   
It got severe enough that after exams for first semester ended I gave up. I didn't go to a single class in 2nd semester, skipped labs constantly, and even skipped a few final exams. Meanwhile throughout the entire 2nd year even though I was gone for like 4 months, none of the people I knew from uoft cared to even text me and ask ""yo you still alive?"".   
Fast forward to now I'm enjoying my peaceful summer, working a small engineering job and living life!  
I got PRO2 which stands for probation 2 (I also failed a class in 1st sem) and are suspended from uoft for 8 months including summer.

Overall ... UofT did make me feel like the biggest failure in the world; its a school that doesn't care if you make it out or unalive yourself because of the sheer amount of work it puts on you, and it only cares about your money.

PLEASE DON'T END UP LIKE ME! If you feel like you're about to go down the same path as I did DO ANYTHING TO GET SOME HELP. It still hurts that I have to do 2nd year again when everyone I used to know is moving on.",comment,3

Don‚Äôt worry about the others. Stop right now. Academic success has a correlation to life success but only to a certain extent. The question you should ask yourself is this: Do I have the hunger to make it in life? Nothing will drive you to success like hunger.  

Friend of mine literally had a 1.9 GPA in third year and secured a pretty good internship. He‚Äôs someone who takes action in life. And he wasn‚Äôt even that outgoing. Now he‚Äôs travelling the world and enjoying life. So DOING things in life is much more important than worrying about a 3.8 GPA. 

As for social skills, just put yourself out there. There may be external factors involved that mess with your head such as not being in shape, not having enough money etc..but your mindset is what‚Äôll set you apart. How are you going to improve your life from this very moment?? Gotta ask yourself these questions every single day. 

Also, keep in mind UofT is just a name, 10 years from now are you or anyone you know still going to care that you went to UofT when Jimmy from Ryerson has a yacht? Not exactly. Life is what you make of it.

I know it can sometimes feel like there's a set way to be successful, and it usually goes along the lines of courses, side projects, internships, letters of recommendations, etc. But if you think about it and you abstract the things that these really show, then its more like how credible are you? Can you self learn? Are you passionate? Start small with the available doors open to you. I really hope I don't sound preachy at this point, but I have a friend who got a job just through blogging about her degree and writing about research papers she found interesting. Its obviously difficult to be motivated and really easy to procrastinate- but you need to fix this first. Then your goals will seem a bit more clear. Also, idk if this is the engineering student in me talking, but have fulfilling hobbies. So many of the people around me operate on this robot scedule that's gonna eventually burn you out/allow you to disappear once you graduate with everyone else. But yeah, take this time and consider yourself a little lucky because the best thing you can do with this degree is be creative. Show what makes you unique in your field and blood sweat and tears your way through it. Do something bold when sending an email, and place emphasis on skills that other people might not even consider related (biggest supporter of the idea that everything is connected)¬† Set some time aside to learn the rules of the game though, even if they seem like small side projects, they're good if you can pick an interesting topic. Find a mentor if you can to get feedback as you work on learning and building a foundation for skills. Coming from a 2.0 gpa student who's just learning the ropes - good luck op!!

Don‚Äôt neglect your health and fitness for just school and work. You need this body for the rest of your life. And in 10-20 years you‚Äôll laugh at how trivial all these problems are now. These problems with school, grades and stress of finding jobs all sound life altering and huge to you today but will seem trivial once you pass them. 

Training, exercising, and  have a healthy diet is essential for your mental health and can give you more energy, reduce stress/cortisol, and is great for your overall mental clarity and mood. Your body also produces serotonin and healthy dopamine. 

Every time I‚Äôm super stressed or over thinking I go for a bike ride, a long walk outside, or lift weight and I feel so much better, confident and relaxed and can think and plan clearly. 

Sleep is also essential. Ik it might sound cliche and redundant but believe me. Try getting in at least 7 hours 7 days in a row and you‚Äôll feel superhuman. Don‚Äôt stay up late if you don‚Äôt have work or important shit to do. Fix your Circadian Rhythm/ your internal clock and get sun light daily(even if it‚Äôs cloudy, get 20min of sun light right after sleep. 

Drink a lot of water and healthy foods. I‚Äôm not saying count calories but employ the same strategy as signal to noise ratio even in your diet. So 80% of the diet eat first, healthy proteins and meats, healthy carbs and unprocessed foods and no junk or fast foods, the rest of the 20% treat yourself. 

4. Schedule and plan heavily. Google calendar, Google keep, iCloud calendar, reminders, notes. It‚Äôll de stress you and you know what you gotta do daily, weekly, and even one month down the line. 

Add all meetings, lectures, appointments in Calder with reminders and all assignments and test with reminders for as early as 14 days, then set a reminder on the Calder event for 10, 7, 3, 2 and 1 days. So you‚Äôre constantly reminded and won‚Äôt miss them. 

Colour code and make separate calendars for each part of your life:

I have one for: 

University: all lectures, tutorials, test, assignment and exam events and dates with reminders going back 14 days or sometimes even more and reminder/alerts on the Calder event like I mention above. 

Social: this is for parties, dates, family events, going to the cinema to watch a movie, going to the beach, whatever it may be. 

Fitness: Add your gym sessions with daily(I do 9am day off) and an hour before the gym session reminders/alerts. 


Personal: This is for all free time, appointments, dr appointments, haircuts, shopping, whatever you like to do in your free time 

Work: this is for well, work and work tasks, meetings and events 

Make a separate colour for each so it‚Äôs clear what‚Äôs what and make the Calendar events that happen weekly recurring events. If it‚Äôs a daily event like for example fitness do daily and lectures do weekly. Update it daily or weekly. 

Then make a to do list of the specific project, assignment, tests studying, and any other specific tasks you wanna do that day. Make it in tow 2 sections signal (which should take up 70-80% of your waking hours) and noise(20-30% of your waking hours: which is free time or time for shit that‚Äôs not a priority). You can do this on a paper Calendar but make sure it‚Äôs for daily tasks and not weekly cuz you need space to write. 
(Number the signal and noise to do list by order of priority and importance) 

If you don‚Äôt get all your daily to do list/tasks done it‚Äôs ok but try to finish majority of them. Anything not done today, move it to tmrws to do list.",comment,14

Focus on your grades and gpa and try to find friends and built a social circle. 

As for everyone else, it‚Äôs al noise. There‚Äôs an idea called signal to noise ratio by Steve Jobs. 

In your waking hours 80% of your tasks should be signal and signal is what needs to get done today, priorities: like work, studying, exercising, to do list and Important things you have to finish TODAY. 

Noise: everything else, goals, future plans, social life, miscellaneous tasks, thinking what other ppl are doing and comparing yourself with them. 

Once you do this you get closer to the goal daily and actually accomplish a lot and before you know it you reached that goal. 

Take university for instance. If you think about the fact that you need 20 credits to get your bachelors and this gpa and to make POSt if you haven‚Äôt for example, and etc etc. You‚Äôll always be stressed, have anxiety, fomo and think about what other people are doing. and procrastinate cuz you‚Äôre full of noise and your mind is thinking about the noise. 

Cut away all the noise. 

And there‚Äôs millions of differences between each person, and no one is the same. Everyone‚Äôs environment, background, personality, work ethic, social circle, network, connections, luck, circumstances are different. 


I can tell you from firsthand experience and seeing this with my own eyes time and time again don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre behind and other people are doing better than you. 

Majority of students that have a great empty resume are not that bright and it‚Äôs a lot of fakery, imitation and fooling people going on. 

I have several friends at UofT, that if you go on their linked in profile and other social media you‚Äôd think they‚Äôre CEO of chase bank or chairman of the federal reserve or a billionaire entrepreneur or ceo of Fortune 500 or a world leader in politics. 

But they‚Äôre failing university, have no routine or schedule, wake up at noon, and they‚Äôre doing so many universal things that ‚ÄúLOOKS‚Äù nice and productive and that they‚Äôre successful but it‚Äôs all for LOOKS and it‚Äôs all noise. 

At the end of the day see why your goals are and focus on them. Is it grad school, law or medical school? Focus on your gpa and boost your grades as much as you can cuz that‚Äôs 70% of what matters. 

You‚Äôre a university student and your job is the university and studying. That‚Äôs the priority. Any extra time you have, join student clubs, university events, job fairs, grad school fairs, build your resume and update it and apply to a dozen jobs a week. But again that‚Äôs secondary right now, priority is great grades. 

I used to think like you but once I set goals with a ‚Äútimeline‚Äù and ‚Äúdeadline‚Äù and broke it down into steps, then I‚Äôm 80% signal daily. And get closer to my goals daily. 

And I never think about other ppl or if they‚Äôre doing better than me, what‚Äôs popular, trading, or try to copy and emulate them. Cuz I have my goals and know what it takes to achieve them and get there and I‚Äôm on track. 

The reason you feel this way is because you might not have a well defined goal, plan or end result you want to achieve badly, and strive towards daily. 

A goal without a deadline, timeline and plan is only wishful thinking and lying to yourself. Break the goal down and tell yourself what does it truly take, what actions do I need to implement, what habits to develop and what to do daily to get increments closer to that result or goal. Then implant the signal to ratio daily, you don‚Äôt have to do 80% signals and 20% noise that‚Äôs just an example, do 70/30 or 60/40.

And you be so busy and productive that you won‚Äôt even have time or energy to think about others and work lent care less what they‚Äôre doing or are up to. 

Have a sense of urgency but with yourself and your life, not against someone else and what they‚Äôre doing. Believe me a lot of your peers and ppl you see that have it all figured out, don‚Äôt have shit figured out. They‚Äôre just trying so many different things at once and hope one sticks, only difference is they‚Äôre doing and taking action, even though that action is without planning, and all over the place, which can help them, hence the linked in profiles with dozens of accreditations, certificates, volunteer and student club experiences that 99% of employers don‚Äôt care about and they care about your degree, REAL WORLD work experience, not being the head of a student club, and some care about your gpa (if it‚Äôs hyper competitive and they ask for it).


Also having great people around you is key. Friends are overrated if it‚Äôs just fake friendships and wasting your time in social circles. Pick and choose the people you associate with carefully and asses if they‚Äôre value to your life, if they‚Äôre genuinely good people, if they have the same values and principles. 

You truly are the average of the people you hang with‚Ä¶that‚Äôs a cardinal rule and fact. 

But friendships and being social can‚Äôt be forced. Let it come to you and it‚Äôll happen naturally. Just be open to socializing and communication and try to network and connect with classmates in lectures, tutorials and another great way to meet friends and intervening people is at the gym or any event the university offers.


Final tip: 

1. Update your resume monthly and make tweets to it and make it A.I. optimized I forgot the correct scanning algorithm but majority of businesses and employers use A.I. to scan resumes for what they‚Äôre looking for, whether that name be. This is cuz they get hundreds of resumes and it makes it easier, albeit cold and heartless and they might miss bright candidates doing this. 

2. Go to office hours a lot and create a relationship and somewhat friendship with your profs. Try to do research with them or work with or volunteer for them. 2-3 reference letters from profs is worth an entire linked in profile and all the jargon you see on there. 

Become friends with your profs essentially and before you know it your circle is intellectuals and people that can add value to your job prospects.",comment,3

So I think I'll give you a broad answer here, and if you need more detail, you can DM I guess.

In terms of what research I've been able to get, the simple answer is research with profs ;). It's a broad question, and I kind of have an eclectic background; since first year, I've done volunteer research, paid research (in the form of NSERC USRA, and just simple stipends from profs), research at Vector, and my workplace is heavy on research as well. And as for what subjects: ML/AI, mathematical bio, NLP, CS ed, and stats. 

In terms of what classes were beneficial for research... my advice here might be a bit unconventional. There are only two classes that I think have been essential to my ability to do research: MAT137 for being able to think rigorously and write proofs and STA355 for the ability to apply that to statistics (which is my main field of interest now). Everything else I've done research in, I've learned from scratch (besides having a baseline competence in math/sta/cs). So for instance, I've worked with Vector, and yet I've never taken an ML course in my life. I've published first-author in NLP, and I've never taken an NLP course in my life. So on so forth. Classes at the undergraduate level are there to give you an *introductory* understanding of a field. To do actual research, I find that you need to be willing to put in the hard yards outside of class. 

The actual benefit of classes is the ability to network with profs. I've never been someone who's been good at going to class, but my friends who do, really benefit from being able to talk to a prof face-to-face. A prof will obviously favour you more if they know you :).

As for general advice: know the difference between limiting yourself, and knowing your boundaries. It's a lot better to be specialised in 1/2 fields, than have a overly diverse background. At a certain point, that really doesn't help, and it's something I wish I knew earlier in my life. With that said, you need a strong level of fundamentals in all of MAT/STA/CS. Although these aren't necessarily the courses that have been most impactful towards my research work, these are the courses that I think have been most beneficial for my development: MAT137, MAT224, MAT357, CSC148, CSC165, CSC373, STA261, STA355, STA492.

And here's perhaps some advice for getting research (might have skipped that). The hardest thing in getting research is finding a prof to trust you. For me, I am infinitely grateful to two profs that trusted me despite my apparent lack of experience. And once you show results with some profs (e.g. in the form of publications), I find that other profs are more likely to trust your research potential. Never underestimate the ability to cold email well, and always be on the lookout for opportunities. If you get rejected, don't take it personally. Even the smartest people I know, have gotten rejected many times. And also: even if you don't have a prof, there's nothing stopping you from proposing ideas to profs. They might ignore or ghost you. Or they might support you. 

Getting jobs is a little bit different, and I won't really cover that in depth here. But three quick points. First, projects are obviously important. But it is just as important to make sure they're unique and cool. Second, your resume really, really matters. And third, I hope you're good at coding (I don't mean the coding UofT teaches you either). And if you're not, it might be worth hopping on leetcode for a bit. Because in my experience, soft interviews are usually pretty easy, and coding ones are the easiest to mess up. 

This was an incredibly long answer, and I'm sorry for that. Hopefully it's helpful though.",comment,3
