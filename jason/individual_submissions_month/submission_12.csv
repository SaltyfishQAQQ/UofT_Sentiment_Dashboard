I went to Belize for a week through a [program run by New College and CELA](https://www.newcollege.utoronto.ca/indigeneity-sustainability-and-food-belize-2023/) to study indigeneity, food, and sustainability. It was life changing. I grew so much and met so many friends. I contributed only $200 to go, everything else was covered fully. They call out for applications at the begging of the winter semester of each year normally.

Another way is through courses![ International course modules](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/international-opportunities/international-course-modules#past-icms-accordion-1), or [Indigenous course modules](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/indigenous). These are courses that you take during the regular school year and then during reading week you get to travel abroad to learn. This year there are trips to Greece, South Africa, Peru, Guatemala, the UK, and more! Again all only for $200.

Theres also the [School of Cities International Multidisciplinary Urban Capstone Project ](https://schoolofcities.utoronto.ca/learning-sofc/mucp/)(IMUCP) that allows you to work with people from other disciplines and travel to places like India, St. Kitts and Nevis, etc. These trips are fully covered! 

There is so much to learn from field work, so I suggest that everyone apply with the intent to learn and not pursue these frivolously as a vacation. These are really meaningful opportunities that open doors for students who especially would financially be locked out of opportunities to study abroad otherwise.

I hope this post leads someone to an amazing learning experience abroad that goes beyond their wildest dreams!",comment,9

He has long hair and sometimes has his pigtails as his hairstyle. He’s around the English and Philosophy departments on most days. If you see him and get his attention while saying “Welcome to MUNA” instead of saying “hello” or any form of a greeting, he gives you his first two books for free. But he only does it for one student per semester, which is the first student that says the phrase to him. You’ll have to wait for the next semester to try to catch him around and be the first to say the phrase if you want his books for free. The books merge dark fantasy and philosophy, and after some time, you’re not sure if what he is doing is just a magical story he made up or if what he wrote is something that is real. He makes the books himself, and he’s kind of idiosyncratic, but you’ll probably think about dark fantasy differently after that encounter.",comment,6

I got to go to Palo Alto, Singapore, Geneva, and more for almost nothing out-of-pocket. I've done research/work at these settings, developed strong relationships and made everlasting memories. UofT has insane connections with other universities for research opportunities, programs, and conference funding, and I would argue these funds tend to be underutilized by students.

Check out the international experience office - they offer a *generous* amount of funding for these opportunities. UofT has such a large network across the world and it would be a shame to not make the most out of it.",comment,1

>  
The Change of Coverage & Opt-Out period is at the beginning of every school year, or the beginning of the Winter semester (for those students who began their school year in the Winter term) During these periods, you can opt out, or enrol your spouse and/or dependent children in the Health & Dental Plan.

>You must show proof of coverage from another plan to opt-out of the health portion of the plan. Provincial coverage is not sufficient as another plan. You may opt-out of the dental portion of the plan without providing proof of other coverage.

>For students beginning in the Winter term, the Change of Coverage & Opt-Out period is Jan. 2-31. Please note that for those beginning in the Winter semester, coverage under the plan is from Jan. 1 to August 31.
