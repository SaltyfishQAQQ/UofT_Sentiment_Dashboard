Don't be distracted by social media (like Reddit) when you are working or studying. Take two nights a week to have fun, whatever that means for you. Make friends so you can discuss tough questions together (but don't copy off your friends). 

Also, make sure you eat as well as you can afford, get enough sleep, and try to move your body in whatever ways are comfortable for you that you enjoy. Those will all help you to be more productive.",comment,5

edit: yes also as they mentioned, specialty streams like aero or biomed which aren't as easily accessible in core 8 are also a reason you may want to do engsci. but again these are areas which would probably prefer a master's anyways",comment,5
