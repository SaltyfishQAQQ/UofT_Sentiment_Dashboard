SYNTHETIC AND CATALYTIC CHEM SPECS HAVE TO TAKE 5 YEARS TO GRADUATE NOW SINCE HALF THEIR UPPER COURSES NEED THE LABS AS PREREQS AND ANYONE WANTING TO DO A CHEM MINOR IS FUCKED. WHAT IS WITH THIS FUCKASS DEPARTMENT, ALL THESE LABS IN LASH MILLER AND YOU CANT HAVE ANY EVENING SECTIONS????? THERE ARE MORE THAN 20 PEOPLE IN CHEMICAL PHYSICS AND THE CHEMISTRY SPECIALIST AND THERE’S ONLY 28-40 SPACES FOR L E C T U R E   C O U R S E S. HOW IS ANYONE SUPPOSED TO GRADUATE IN 4 YEARS HERE???? ITS LIKE THEY LOOKED AT THE ENROLMENT HELL FROM LAST YEAR AND WAS LIKE “this is fine”. THEY BETTER START OFFERING THIRD YEAR LAB COURSES IN SUMMER BECAUSE WHAT THE HELL. ",submission,79

It's an endless loop. I couldn't make it to CHM343 last year so I had to gun for it this year and I'm sure a lot of other 4th years had the same problem. Then you'll do the same next year,comment,20

Maybe they might increase the course sizes for 326 and 328 if enough people are on the waitlist since they’re lecture courses with no labs (it’s absurd that 326 only has like 40 spots when phy356 has 200 despite them being exclusions seriously wth),comment,2
