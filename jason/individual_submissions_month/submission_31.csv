I'll start: AST101 (The Sun and it's Neighbours): mandatory attendance (with clicker), tutorials, and a project due near the end of the semester. I ended up doing alright, but the class average was a C+, which is WAY lower than I expected given that it's pretty much the universal first year bird course lol

The class did not have access to the lecture slides, and there was a lot of memorization required for the midterm in December (the course is a full year). Our study guide told us to study everything, EVEN if it wasn't said or written in lecture. So the whole textbook and readings were fair game on the midterm. I personally didn't enjoy learning about anthropology in general, so I might be a bit biased in this review. If you truly enjoy learning about anthropology, then definitely take this course, but don't just take this course if you're not interested and you think its going to be easy. This was just my experience, and I'm sure other people had different experiences with this course too!",comment,13
