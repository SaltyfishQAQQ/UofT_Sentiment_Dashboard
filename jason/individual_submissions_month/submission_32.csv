How common is it to actually get a work study position?,SignificanceLost5958,1mfajba,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mfajba/how_common_is_it_to_actually_get_a_work_study/,1754088060.0,"From all the posts I've seen, it seems like you basically have to apply to like 100+ positions just to get a few interviews and maybe an offer. So I'm wondering, out of the people who applied, how many of you actually ended up with a position in the end and how many applications and interviews did it take? And what about everyone else? did you just keep applying until the deadline or did you give up after a while? how many applications and interviews did you do? It's starting to seem like maybe it isn't even worth it to try and find a work-study position given how oversaturated and competitive it is, not to mention the current job market in general.
Edit: For context, I‚Äôm a second year transfer student in psych",submission,43
How common is it to actually get a work study position?,XZLDESTRUCTION,n6frlxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mfajba/how_common_is_it_to_actually_get_a_work_study/n6frlxe/,1754090110.0,"Work-study has become quite competitive. In my first-year Fall-Winter, I applied to about 20 positions and was offered 3 interviews. Summer after first-year, I applied to about 30 and was offered 8 interviews. Both terms gave me multiple acceptances to choose from. This last summer, I applied to 60 positions, got 4 interviews, and was rejected from all of them.

The program is currently no longer sitting on an excess of funding that they previously received, which means less positions are posted to the board than in previous years. And alongside mounting student unemployment in the private sector, you'll definitely have a struggle",comment,28

I'm not sure if this is true, so please take this information with a pinch of salt, but I think the work-study program got budget cuts?? For this summer's work-study term, there weren't that many positions, and it seems like there was more competition for fewer positions. In my opinion, UofT not funding the work-study program is crazy because for many UofT students, work-study is one of the only ways which we can get a part-time job in this economy ü•≤ü•≤. Hopefully UofT refunds the work-study program because there are so many students who depend on work-study jobs for various reasons.",comment,10

My manager received an email from the university telling them that there will be even less positions for the fall/winter term.,comment,6

And both of them were rejections that I wouldn‚Äôt have even gotten if I didn‚Äôt personally email them about my application status. I didn‚Äôt get a single interview.

Maybe it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt have internship experience? (All I have is work experience in a couple of jobs I did over the years). But nowadays you need internship experience to get internship experience, and work study experience to get work study experience. It‚Äôs a vicious cycle.",comment,7

I did end up getting an offer late April so I stopped applying. While I was shortlisting positions to apply for, some clearly said that they prefer students in earlier years of their undegrad degree because a lot of the times the work study students stay for research projects in their third/senior year. In my own experience, even tho a lot of the positions have a very late deadline, it might be better to apply early as some positions might be filled up early. 

I would say it's definitely worth applying for because you never know when things might work out. But my advice would be to apply as early as possible and to tailor your cover letter for each position.",comment,2
