There are 100k students, with a bunch being international and paying humongous tuition, plus the public funding they receive. ISNT THAT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO MAKE A WORKING WEBSITE?????? ISNT THAT ENOUGH FOR THEM TO OFFER ENOUGH CLASS SEATS FOR EVERYONE?????  
like, how do you make sense of this course enrolment????? how do they say with a straight face that besides paying tuition, besides doing good in your classes, you still have to pray for your acorn to work faster other students', or else you might not be able to enrol in a class you need for your graduation????
I get uof has a shton of students, but why tf do they accept so many ppl if they can't provide a functional education for all of them???
 Of course its because of the tuition fees, as they can keep providing ass services because uofts reputation keeps bringing new students in. If they can keep their bad infrastructure and still bag tuition fees, why would they invest in better stuff for the students?
Completely nonrelated, but another thing that makes me mad is how late they publish final exams dates. For international students this is hell, specially in the fall term. Want to spend the holidays in family? Well, either you gamble and buy tickets before the finals' dates are announced or you wait and end up having to pay ridiculously high prices for the tickets. I trully wonder why they cant share the dates in September already. It is not as if they only knew which classes have a final exam in November, so why do they take so long to make the schedule and share it. 
Anyways, I was so mad with course enrolment today and had to rant somewhere ",submission,287

You're in second year now, you know the drill. Most 200-level classes float around 60 to 80 students, about 70% land in that sweet spot. Maybe 20% inch up to 100, and barely 5% go beyond or fall short of 50. Not official stats, but its a ballpark…So you cane waitlist or there's almsotnalwsys apce available for you, especially if they're courses for your major since you get priority enrolment. 

Yeah, waitlists suck, and ACORN moves slower than Toronto traffic during rush hour, especially when everyone jumps on at once. But here's a news flash: it affects literally everyone, domestic or international. Paying international tuition fees doesn't give you VIP access to the site; domestic students pay through taxes, so you're not exactly bankrolling the servers alone.


ACORN crashes because, surprise, over 100 thosousand students are stampeding the system simultaneously within the 2-3 weeks of course enrolment. And at any time tens of thousands of students login for each years course enrolment time.

I had no issues cuz I had my courses and time slots ready in enrolment cart and just pressed enrol when I signed in…it take some pre planning pn your part. 

Sure, your frustrations about late exam schedules are valid, but let's drop the entitled attitude for a second. Try juggling exam dates and locations for 7,500 courses across three campuses. St. George alone has about 4,300 courses, UTM and UTSC tack on another 3,200. 

Doesn't sound that simple now does it? 

Everyone gets their exam schedule and  timetables late. Its not just you and your 100k tuition lol. 

And yeah, we all have our petty complaints, like no study rooms when finals roll around, or gym rush hour looking like a Black Friday sale. But you're sharing this space with thousands of other people, not booking a private resort. This is the real world and it won't revolve around you or accomodate your needs and wants specifically. 

Take a step back and recognize the privilege you've got. U of T ranks consistently as Canada's best university and comfortably sits within the global top 25. They have around 29.7% international students, significantly more inclusive than most elite institutions that favor legacy admissions and nepotism. You're here on merit, not because your last name gets buildings named after it.

U of T’s infrastructure, libraries, and academic resources are unmatched in Canada. You’ve got access to databases and Ivy League-level publications most students only dream about. Your professors? They're primarily Ivy League and Oxbridge educated, leading researchers, and recognized experts in their fields. Good luck finding that caliber at most other Canadian schools.

Bottom line, complain if you must, but keep your head on straight and realize the immense benefits you're getting here. It’s U of T, not some second-tier community college.",comment,-8

Its really clear to me I lacked communication in my post, as ppl commented the same misconception over and over again. 

I DONT want to be privileged just because I pay international tuition, and never meant that. I DO THINK international students should pay more than resident students, because the taxes from canadian citizens should be used to invest in canadian society. Therefore, as uoft receives funding coming from the canadian government, canadian students should be able to have a more affordable upper education here.
I DO, however, think that in the moment I apply and get into uoft, I pay my tuition and attend my classes, I am a student equal to another, canadian or not. 

What I was mad about in my post is that EVERYONE complains about the course enrolment at uoft - something I believe the university should be able to solve with some investment, which would lead to a better experience for every student. You shouldn't have to worry about not being able to attend an important class just because you weren't quick enough to press enroll. Also, about that, just fyi I too had my whole schedule planned and in my enrolment cart. I actually even had a whole ah flow chart just to know what other courses Id enroll if I didnt manage to get into what I primarily wanted. Even with all of that, both today and in my priority period I took like 40 minutes only to press enroll and have it work.

About the privilege I have, I do know and acknowledge it! Uoft is a great university with great education. But acknowledging that doesn't disable me from criticizing things that could and should improve. Maybe I was too harsh with my words in the post, but that was the mind state that course enrolment left me at today. 

About the finals schedule, nah, it should be that simple. As soon as September hits they have all necessary information: which courses will have finals, the days when finals will take place, and the rooms available at those days. It shouldn't take long to have a program sort everything and have a 3/4 people fine check everything just to see if stuff isn't off. Maybe Im wrong and theres something more to it, but it really looks like something you could just chat gpt.",comment,8

Sorry, I think I might have been unclear in my rant, but the only thing Im asking is for a university ranked among the best in the world to actually show why it is so. I know uoft is a public canadian institution, and that the tax money that has been spent on it should be reverted to canadian society through canadian students. I do agree that international students should pay more in public institutions, as it would be unfair with residents. Now, once I payed my international student fee I do think I should be able to complain about the university, just as any canadian student would. I don't think entitlement is the correct word when Im complaining about a service I payed for. (about the educational system in my country I do agree, I still hope to one day see students coming from other countries to study in brazil)

Meh. Waterloo draws students acrosd the country for programs across its offingd.

MgGill, likewise.

UBC, same.

UofT? Lol nope. And nothing in OPs post talked about math/comp sci.

It may have a few programs at the undergraduate level that are worth moving for, but for the vast majority, most students would be far better off staying in their home province and finding a local, smaller univerisity with smaller class sized and - equal or better - teaching at the undergrsd level. Or starting at a local college and transferring into a uni inthird year. There will always be ‘some programs’ and even ‘some teachers’ that make it worthwhile.
