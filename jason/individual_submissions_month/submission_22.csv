The key is not to look at them for anything more than a second, never make eye contact. To an unhinged addict, that's a challenge. Best to walk around them by about 5feet or cross the road. This all started with mental health issues but now it's about addiction and desperation.

They're looking for a fight, could be because it's mid month out of drugs if this happened recently. Or if this was timed for the first week after payday, they've taken too much meth or crack. Not fentanyl, they sleep out of the way unless it's tranq, freeze like zombies on the sidewalk but still not reacting.

They all get money from our government. $733 Ontario Works OW, or $1408 Ontario Disability Support Program, ODSP if they have a room or lie about having one. They get about $400-600 less if no room rental. This money runs out as the month progresses to stay high. They rely on donations or trading anything they can steal. All goes to drugs since we have so many free handouts downtown to eat, clothe and feed oneself. Not cigarettes though.

Anyways, if this happens every time to you, might help to change your behaviour slightly. Next time could be worse even if you feel you can well defend yourself, homeless addicts all pocket carry knives downtown. It's why all the stabbings in the news downtown. Gangs can afford those illegal guns, eh!",comment,4

Just follow others' advice to watch out for those particular individuals. Travel in groups and try to walk away from them or take alternate route. Follow number 1 rule of self defense: avoid altercation unless necesaary.,comment,1
