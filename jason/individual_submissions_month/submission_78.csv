Should I just give up on UofT Engineering once and for all?,IntlStudent800,1lzhc5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1lzhc5b/should_i_just_give_up_on_uoft_engineering_once/,1752483082.0,"Hey,

I really need some honest advice.

I started UofT ECE in 2023 and completely tanked my first semester. A mix of personal issues and external pressure wrecked my mental health and I ended up on academic probation. Things didn’t get better in second semester — I was stuck in a cycle of depression and escaped into social media all day instead of facing my problems. I didn’t put in the work, and it showed.

That summer, I retook 3 failed courses and finally got my act together: 2 A+’s and a B. For a moment, it felt like I was back. Like I could still do this.

Then 2nd year Fall happened.
I failed 4 courses. I got hit with an 8-month academic suspension.
My depression hit an all-time low. I was almost suicidal and had dark thoughts. I kept scrolling all day to numb myself use escapism and stop thinking. My parents stayed supportive through it all, and I honestly feel like I didn’t deserve them. I let them down in every possible way.

Why did this happen?
•	I massively underestimated how brutal second year would be
•	My mental health was not at all good
•	I had zero structure, no time management, no routine
•	I only studied right before exams
•	I had no friends or real support at UofT
•	And I just never built healthy coping mechanisms

I convinced myself maybe I’m just not cut out for UofT. Maybe I should just leave Canada, restart my degree in the middle east (where I’m from), and then go abroad again for a Master’s.
Easier to manage, less pressure, I’d probably do well there and rebuild my confidence.

But here’s the dilemma:

If I go back to UofT this fall and do well (Fall + Winter):
•	They’ll erase my 0.33 GPA semester and just mark it as “retroactive withdrawal”
•	I stay on track for a UofT engineering degree —  global value
•	I also keep my Canadian PR, and I’m on track for citizenship (long story short, my family moved back home from Canada)

If I restart in the middle east:
•	Clean slate, probably much better grades
•	Lower stress, better mental health, more support from family
•	But I lose my PR and chance at Canadian citizenship
•	Universities don’t have the same brand value — so I have to go abroad for a Master’s to compensate

So yeah… I’m torn. I want to go back to UofT, but I’m scared I’ll crash again. I don’t know if I’m mentally strong enough to pull off 5 intense courses under pressure with no second chances. But walking away from UofT, my PR, and everything I worked for feels like giving up.

Has anyone been through anything similar? What would you do in my shoes?
I’d really appreciate any perspective. I’ve been stuck in this mental loop for weeks and feel totally lost.

Thanks for reading.

P.S. Please don’t comment just to tear me down. I already know I messed up and I beat myself up for it daily. I’m not looking for sympathy, just clarity.",submission,15
Should I just give up on UofT Engineering once and for all?,payloadchap,n32639a,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1lzhc5b/should_i_just_give_up_on_uoft_engineering_once/n32639a/,1752493593.0,"So, I relate to this a lot. *A lot*. I finished first year of ECE with decent grades and then promptly failed 4/5 courses of 2nd year fall semester and was suspended for 8 months. Like you, I had terrible time management skills (COVID and online learning didn't help in that regard), only studied before exams, had no engineering friends, and didn't reach out for help because I somehow thought I'd be able to handle it even after my very poor midterm results. 

Understanding what you were doing wrong instead of deflecting the blame is the first step, and it is also the biggest step. From the looks of things, you've already started that process, but what helped for me was to take a step back and really think about what it is I actually wanted. In the beginning, I was convinced I just wasn't cut out for ECE and was determined to drop out of engineering to study something I ""actually enjoyed"". Once enough time passed and I was able to calm down a bit more, I started thinking about my academic journey and how I'd ended up here.

This is where things diverge for different people. For some, they realize that the issue really is just some kind of executive dysfunction masked by high performance which the engineering curriculum mercilessly exposes with its workload and difficulty and lack of scaffolding like high school provides. Or it could be a faulty assumption that you *must* study something that you're truly passionate about, and if you don't feel that intrinsic passion then something's wrong with you, you don't fit in with the others, and you're studying in the wrong field. It could be a combination of the two. And it could be more. It's really dependent on the individual here, but the good thing about those 8 months of suspension is that it gives you the time to reflect upon yourself.

Anyhow, in my case, on top of the two reasons above, I realized that I had internalized this expectation of exceptionalism, and when I wasn't seeing that being reflected in my grades, it caused a cascading effect where the worse I performed, the more demoralized I got. I was able to break out of that cycle the second time around, and I'm now finishing up my PEY at a top semiconductor company. 

Yes, it's true that the damage to your cGPA isn't ideal and it does affect your ability to land certain opportunities. But it is *by no means* the end of the world. Unless you're gunning for those ultracompetitive software or ML positions or plan on doing research, what I've found is that experience and soft skills can easily substitute for grades. This is especially true for hardware roles that emphasize practical skills. You still have plenty of options if you do choose to give it another shot. 

I'll end things with this: there probably are a lot of different elements that went wrong for you to end up in this situation. Some of it was in your control, some of it wasn't. For the former, identify what those issues were without self-pity, and you'll be able to figure out how to address them. For the latter, accept that you had no control over those elements, and try your best to work around them. And regardless of what any of these elements are, you ""not being smart enough"" is *not* one of them.",comment,5

Is giving up now is the right decision???? You are the best judge of your capabilities. Procrastination is your BIGGEST enemy. If you think you can conquer and do somewhere around 8 credits each year (fall, winter and two summer subsession) then go for it. If you think - not your cup of tea - then also meet the advisor - try and plan your 3 years and see if you can cope with the course load. 

  
I can very well understand that it is not easy to get into a uni of the Stature of UofT. 

  
Having said that - it is better to cut losses and understand what is the best course of action. If you think returning to do the masters makes more sense - go for it. 

  
If you think - you still have a great shot at recovering - Kudos! Try it out. But always be true to yourself.",comment,1

However i do know how u feel because i procrastinated and underestimated my courses like hell and ended having to retake one. Worst feeling ever but probably one of the best things which ever ended up happening to me. i focused on what’s next and made sure i did not procrastinate and doom scroll as a coping mechanism. Yes like you i did that asw. I would recommend definitely find good friends who can help you with studying or just go to every office hours possible. It’s gonna be a grind but do it in my opinion should be worth it. Don’t overestimate ur capabilities and take the minimum course load. You are not gonna get good grades from the get go or probably not by the end of the sem either . But you will get there eventually. 

Looking at the other side idk which country you are from but the point of going to uni is to get a job imo so if you think getting a job there is going to be easier do that. 

Final thoughts don’t be lazy grind it out and like the comment above said procrastination is ur biggest enemy regardless of which university you go to. Each uni will have its own difficulties and nothing comes easy in life.",comment,1

Please only consider doing what you enjoy,  and what keeps your physical and mental health in state. If you feel like being at your HOME country with your parents will lead to a better output in your academic achievement and mental state,  please do so.

P.S If you study in Canada it doesn't guarantee you a PR. Multiple programs even lost their PGWP availability. A process from PGWP to PR only last at least 3 years, and 3 more years for Citizenship without leaving Canada. And it might get even worse in future",comment,0

I already have the PR, I don't have to do anything extra for it other than just stay and study in Canada for 2-3 years until I get my citizenship. So basically, by the time I finish my 4th year, I'll be eligible for it.

The dilemma was that if I leave Canada, I'll lose my PR status that I already have currently. But if I stay and continue, I'll be on the path to citizenship before I graduate UofT.",comment,1
