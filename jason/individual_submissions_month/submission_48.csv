Was course enrolment terrible for anyone else?

The way I was stressing out trying to figure out something that would work out on the spot, my heart was beating so fast. I got waitlisted for 2 important first year courses and Iâ€™m just praying to God that Iâ€™ll get in or else Iâ€™m doomed.

I tried my best to readjust my new schedule so thankfully I should be fine as long as a I get the spots I got in waitlisted for.",submission,24

Sorry to hear it was tough for you. Depending on your program, it'll get easier in the higher years. E.g. I'm a 2nd year Archaeology student and i got all the classes i wanted with sufficient space left. My friends (2nd year Life Sci) got screwed with enrollment because there's so many people taking similar courses. TLDR: the more niche and exclusive your program is, the more likely you are to get the courses you want.",comment,1
