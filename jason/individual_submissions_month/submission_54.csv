Is there a life cycle for clubs? So many clubs exist only for 1 or 2 years,isimsiz60,1mf6zds,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mf6zds/is_there_a_life_cycle_for_clubs_so_many_clubs/,1754079249.0,"I'm an incoming freshman and these days I'm checking student clubs at UofT. But many of them seems to be founded only one or two years ago. I even saw a person founded a club at his/her freshman year, like literally on september. And I didn't see a significant amount clubs that lived for even like at least 5-7 years. Is this the normal at UofT? Why is everybody trying to be a founder rather than taking it from the past leader/president? The clubs I see are mostly related to finance but I encountered a few recently created non-finance related clubs too.",submission,21

Allegedly shows more initiative and it’s infinitely easier than trying for a leadership position at an established clubs,comment,38

There are some exceptions such as ones that require membership fees, receive outside funding, or work very closely with a student levy receiver. Things like game clubs seem to always come and go and others are unable to establish succession one year and then just disappears.

For advice, don’t look at SOP. It has too many inactive clubs and some clubs that are active don’t bother to register. Go to your orientation(s). If you are interested in professional or academic development, look at the course unions for all programs of interest. If you are interested in fitness or the arts, check out hart house. If you are in artsci, start with your college community and college student union. Even if you are off-campus, they are usually a great community to have, and you’re paying fees to them anyway.",comment,16

Clubs need to be competitive, and competitive clubs are made of a lot of competitive students and so you have to first persuade them that you can be a good club by introducing good resources that you can get from external partners if you have competitive members which puts most clubs in a negative feedback loop because it's impossible to start.",comment,8
