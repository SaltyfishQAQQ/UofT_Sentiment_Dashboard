Are there any job options like being a TA, researcher, or a tutor (even if they’re not for freshmen)? If so, are these jobs hard to get? I’m thinking of getting into physics if that helps!!",submission,12

i've mentioned how competitive it is, but it should be noted that your odds of landing a research position at uoft are probably better than other institutions. however, this is pure speculation, so educate yourself on the opportunities available at various institutions.

as for tutoring positions, they exist, but idk how competitive they are; pretty sure that the math learning centre (or whatever it's called) hires upper-years, but take this with a grain of salt. i recall in my first-year physics courses, there were 2nd(?) year tutors specifically for the course. again, don't know how competitive it is to land these positions.",comment,1

Some positions run year round and it's very easy to get rehired for the next year.,comment,1

If I go into physics I actually am planning on continuing my education after my bachelor’s if I can, so hopefully I’ll be able to become a TA then. 

Also, sorry if this is a stupid question, but what exactly do those admin workers do?",comment,1
