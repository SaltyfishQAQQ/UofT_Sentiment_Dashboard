Of course that's if it is not already available for free online, although it can be tricky to find for free for certain courses.
I've seen a few on second-hand buying apps like karrot and Facebook marketplace.
It helps to save the costs of new textbooks from the UofT bookstore at least by a little bit, especially if you end up not using it much in your course.

Hope that helps~",submission,148

It is however illegal to distribute content without permission, so if you want to download textbooks for free without breaking the law, turn off seeding if your method of downloading is by torrenting.",comment,6
