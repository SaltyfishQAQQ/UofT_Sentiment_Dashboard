It was pretty dull mainly because I think the other students were either too shy or embarrassed to do some of the team activities and I felt kinda bad for the team leaders/organizers because honestly they were really enthusiastic and tried their best. They gave us a little tote bag filled with ""goodies"" (an ugly mug (imo), a toothbrush, some stickers and I'm pretty sure like a 10% off booster juice voucher + more things I don't remember). All the people I met at orientation were pretty nice but I do not talk to any of them and are not my friends, I made my friends through lectures/clubs. Also the food was not that good but I was not expecting much anyway (tims and some sandwiches) . Personally I didn't find the experience to be worth +$100. Also the team leaders I talked to said that they gave out T-shirts in previous years and maybe if I had gotten a T-shirt this review would be slightly more positive (I really wanted a T-shirt D: ). Bottom line is, I don't think you need to pay this much money to meet new people.",comment,6

I’m a second year who’s also in new college, last year I didn’t go to orientation and I don’t think there’s any loss at all. Since you gonna live in residence so you will make a lot friends from your rez. Also I have friends who went for the oweek and they think it just so so.

It might be hard to make new friends in your classes, especially as a commuter, so orientation’s a good opportunity to get to know people. You also don’t have to attend all the events if they don’t interest you.",comment,2

Orientation was one of the most fun experiences I’ve had a UofT and it helps with making friends since you’re mostly all in the same boat of not knowing many other people,comment,2

I'd say if you go you have to be in the mood of doing activities and talking to people. A lot of people just go and hope friends will spawn in their lives. It helped me to get more confident before the beginning of the year, but yeah it's not magic and you can still make friends outside of the orientation. I'd still recommend to go but not going is fine",comment,1

I dont think the orientation was that worthy except for the people u meet really, my friend group rn is all from orientation. there def were friends that got distant bc we didnt match the vibe etc but i think its nice to check out once! But also i met many friends after orientation who did not attend and they were perfectly ok w not going too so I think there are different perspectives on this. I personally felt tough making friends after orientation bc you sit in lecture and after its done, everyone goes off, but found easier in tut, labs where you work together.",comment,1
