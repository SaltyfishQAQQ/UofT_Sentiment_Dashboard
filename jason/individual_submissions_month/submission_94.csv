I have two semesters left of undergrad and think I'm cooked for a Master's,emaad-with-hype,1mcpq9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mcpq9m/i_have_two_semesters_left_of_undergrad_and_think/,1753828425.0,"Some context,

I am in fourth year at uOttawa in an Honours Econ with a minor in Math. When I apply UofT will be one of the schools I apply for, I ideally want to get into Munk but I also know it's prestigious and I barely have a shot. I'll still try though.

For context, I'll mostly have a 77% GPA (last two years of courses which Master's check for). So I'm barely making the cut if at all. I was a member of like 2 or 3 extracurricular clubs but never an exec. I have had 5 different internships at different places (Scotia, three in government, most recent in a policy firm). I also wrote an article for a policy website as part of my research project. But that's pretty much it. I have no other research experience, nothing major in an extracurricular, and my grades are mediocre at best. 

So yeah, I'm probably cooked aren't I? My strategy is to go around asking the program directors for advice much like what I'm doing here. Maybe contact some research groups in the University and apply to some FSWEP stuff. But I'm wondering what are the possible options I have. Would love to hear the perspective of past applicants and prospective applicants.",submission,11

Like find someone in the department for what?,comment,1
