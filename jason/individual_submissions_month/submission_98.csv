I am entering my 5th year of undergrad. im a global health, equity, and immunology student. i really want to raise my gpa more, and also, have more years of a successful gpa under my belt. 

i have been in between wanting to apply to law school or grad school. right now i am considering grad school and then seeing if law school is something i want down the road. personally, i feel as though i want to have the option for law school, meaning taking extra years (a diy post-bach if you will) would be beneficial as most law schools i am looking into take your B2/L2 years. my 4th year was alright but i know i can do better, and i honestly have reasons for performing poorly in my eariler years. part of me also thinks just going to grad school would be fine, but law schools dont rlly look at grad gpa, and id be paying a higher tuition for a program. 

now on the flip side, taking grad school would definitely help me improve my skills a bit and even help me find a job (hopefully that is) and possibly persuade me away from law. i am just so interested in law though. in an ideal world, id do grad school, work for a couple years and go into law down the road. id like to go into law with work experience and a better idea of what i want to do in law. 

this all being said, im still not sure what the best option is. i feel as though i am judging myself for wanting to take 5+ years of undergrad, but i know its totally normal now a days. in terms of money, i guess i would be adding on a bit more to my loans as i also receive grants and work part time, so its more to do with my end goal which seems to be more precarious then i thought. 

anywho, any thoughts?",submission,12
