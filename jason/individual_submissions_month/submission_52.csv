Especially engineering guys with your overwhelming routine.   
Do you guys follow a rule like ""only skip when necessary"" or is it more like ""if I don‚Äôt feel like it, I don‚Äôt go""?  
Also, does skipping actually affect your GPA, or do profs usually not care as long as you do the work?  
Would love to hear how others balance attendance, mental health, and just... life.",submission,22

Most of the comments here are terrible. 

FYI your profs do notice if you don't show up. They notice if you're too tired to think. They notice if you seem hung over. They notice if you sleep in a giant lecture or sit there talking to your friends. (I know this because I'm a lecturer). Why don't they say anything? Do you go after a five-year old who calls you a ""dum-dum"" when you're just walking by on the street on your way to the store? 

For English, History, Music (History and Theory) and Linguistics (at least some areas of linguistics) you have the readings and what the prof says about them. Then you read more and form your own ideas about it and that's kind of how learning in the Humanities works.

The 'wait until your 4th year' advice is good, so long as you've learned by your 4th year to ‚Äª‚Äª‚Äªnever‚Äª‚Äª‚Äª miss a lecture / seminar meeting for third and 4th year courses (or even 2nd year courses or tutorials for first year). It's like being a working adult and skipping meetings hoping the boss doesn't notice you're not there. 

If, for some reason, you are in third, fourth or fifth year of your undergrad and are taking a first year course in an area closely aligned with something you've already successfully done, then missing a class might not be a big deal (because you've actually learned how to think and learn by then). But hopefully, if that's the case, you're just taking it out if interest and to broaden your knowledge about the subject you've already done, and so you're interested enough in the subject that you won't want to miss classes.",comment,22

I have friends who do attend classes, and some that don't. I'm of the latter type. And in general, I see minimal differences between our marks. In most STEM classes, I find that if attendance is not mandatory, it is often more beneficial to just not attend class. Those who do attend class might end up getting like a couple percent more than me (this is generally the case), but the upshot I receive by not attending class, is that I have more time to do other extracurricular activities that they don't have the time for. Research, TAing, etc.

This is just my experience though, and as you may have figured out from the other comments, this is definitely not universal. My advice would just be to spend the first few weeks figuring out your learning style. Do you like it when someone explains concepts to you? If that's the case, then lectures are the way to go. If on the other hand you like learning at your own pace, skipping definitely isn't a bad option.",comment,1
