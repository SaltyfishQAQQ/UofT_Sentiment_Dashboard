I started university in 2018 but took two years off, one year due to academic suspension and another year for personal reasons. However, I turned my CGPA around and am now earning 80s in all my courses.

It's never too late to begin your education, so don’t feel too old. I’ve had classmates in their 30s and 40s.

It's more common than you think, and always remember that the majority of university students are in their 20s. You’ll fit right in.

Congratulations, and I wish you all the success!

Starting your studies at 20 can actually be an advantage. You’re older and more experienced than 18-year-old first-years. Additionally, you’re likely in a better mental space, with improved time management skills and a stronger work ethic.",comment,2

Started my undergrad at 22 and am currently entering my 3rd year (took a 2-year gap due to COVID). It's completely normal, and we are still young. Honestly, there's no specific age to head to uni, and everyone leads their journey differently, so no shame/embarrassment in that.  

Also, a gap year was the best decision that I made for myself, as it helped me reset, research about future aspirations, which led to choosing the program that I am currently studying and liking. 

You got this, and all the best :-)",comment,1
