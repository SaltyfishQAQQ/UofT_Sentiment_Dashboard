Would love to have any to all advice that I can!

(For ref, planning to major in poli sci and soc/phil w/ days a week where I prioritize extracurriculars. However, not am employed lol) ",submission,13

Develop a good sleeping cycle before classes start, I cannot stress how important sleep is.

Textbooks or other related course materials come after first week but start checking Quercus around last week of August, some profs post course syllabus early. 

Expect first year to be the most difficult so it's okay if your gpa doesn't look incredible on papers focus on getting into your post and establishing a good base (like writing skills) if you don't the remaining 3/4 years will be just as difficult. 

Use office hours, talk to the TAs, usually it's the TAs that grade your work so if the TA know who you are, more often than not you'll do better on essays.",comment,8

Get familiar with staircases, washrooms, entrance and exit doors, and the general layout of the room itself. Also locate any coffee/food trucks nearby. Huge stress reducer for your first week.",comment,3

In 1st year thereâ€™s a big learning curve in regard to writing essays at a college level. I remember my first couple of papers were pretty messy and I regret not taking advantage of the writing centers,comment,1

Not mandatory but those uoft calenders and a sexy pair of whiteboard markers saved me for organizing exam days, tutorial quizzes, assignments, etc

Skim the subreddit and maybe kijiji/facebook marketplace when ur syllabi come out and a book is required

Review your finances and set dates to make the most of ur tuition payments. A lot of students skip out on getting a good dental scaling or even fillings

Make sure ur devices are set up for ur courses like note taking, having an ipad, etc",comment,1
