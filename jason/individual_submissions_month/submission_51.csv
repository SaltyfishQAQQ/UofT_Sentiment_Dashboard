Let's say you're doing a math major, which takes 8 FCE to complete, and an English major, which also take 8 FCE to complete.  To do both majors, you'll need to take 16 FCE of courses to complete because the two majors have nothing in common.  Yay!  16 > 12.

Let's say you're doing a math major, which takes 8 FCE to complete, a stats minor which takes 4 FCE to complete, and a physics minor which also take 4 FCE to complete.  And let's say the stats minor requires 2 FCE of basic math courses and the physics minor requires 1.5 FCE of basic math courses.  Other than that, there's no overlap.  8 + 4 - 2 + 4 - 1.5 = 12.5 > 12 but barely.

You can imagine that there would be combos where the overlap is truly significant and doesn't reach the 12 FCE bar.  

The idea is that you cannot satisfy the degree requirements by putting together a bundle of programs that are too closely related.

Does this help?",comment,49

What is is meant by ‚Äúmust consist of 12 different credits‚Äù for graduation requirements?,ThatGenericName2,n5frsw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mani04/what_is_is_meant_by_must_consist_of_12_different/n5frsw5/,1753626456.0,"My understanding is that the credits for those programs must be distinct. Ie; if I'm doing a physics major and a CS major, there's a number of math courses that are requirements for both programs. For the purpose of program requirements, those credits are counted as effectively only done for one of the 2 programs.

The 20 credit requirement for graduation gives quite a buffer for this requirement, and so in the example below let's pretend that there's instead a 12 credit requirement for graduation. Let's say I've 12 credits worth of courses, of which 4 is unique to CS (meaning not from courses that are also a requirement in physics), 4 is unique to Physics, and 4 credits are from courses that are required courses in both programs, and let's also pretend that all the requirements for the programs individually has been satisfied. In this case, even though I've satisfied the individual program requirements, and also required the 12 credit requirement, I have not met the requirements for of 12 different credits because 4 of those credits are from courses that are required in both, and therefore I only have effectively 8 ""different"" credits.

I believe the main purpose of this is to prevent people from essentially doing the minimum requirement to tack on additional minor or major programs since there are occasionally some minor programs that have pretty big overlap with a part of a different program, to give another example, off the top of my head the Math minor program is only a couple courses off most other programs that have heavy math requirements such as CS or Physics.",comment,7

On the other hand, a Stats major and a Physics major probably have a lot less overlap, that when combined, you get more than 12 distinct credits.

In your case, as long as your majors and minors consist of at least 12 distinct cresits, you are good.

They only count 20 credits to the total overall degree, but it is possible to go above, and it is theoretically possible to take 12 each. I expect most students won't, but you can. 

(eg. I graduated with 24 total credits because of condensed courses/overload, and I know someone who had 30-ish credits when they graduated because they just didn't want to graduate and kept taking summer courses/enrolling for the year.)",comment,1
