For starters you have a course conflict on Tuesdays. You do know departments and p4ofessors wont accommodate a course conflict if you have midterms, finals or assignments on the same day or due at the same time? Cuz you picked this schedule. 

Fix that course conflict on Tuesday first. 

Do 5.0 in fall/winter and 1.0 in summer then thank me later. 

I'd even say do 4.0 in fall winter and 1.0 in summer and your still graduate in 4 years. 

Your GPA, mental and physical health will be saved. 

6 courses means at least 12-24 hours of studying per week. Hundreds of pages of reading weekly, 6 midterms, 6 final exams and maybe even more assignmnts and quizzes. 

And you have class all week days. Its better to have a lighter Friday or Monday or no class at all on Mondays or Fridays for errands, shopping, appointments(doctors, haircut, etc), personal stuffâ€¦.and it'd be like as if you have a 3 day weekend and plenty of time to catch up with studies and assignments",comment,4

Also just take 220; 222 is a bunch of math on thermodynamics/kinetics that're honestly not very useful if you're interested in synthetic chemistry - it's way harder than 220 as well (especially if it's still Schofield). 220 covers a bit of quantum as well which helps a lot in terms of understanding and preparing for courses you're gonna have to take in the future as a synth spec like 348 and 443.,comment,1
