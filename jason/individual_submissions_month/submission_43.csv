I think it definitely depends on season and comfort but if you want something that will last you at least all of undergrad go with a backpack. All of my bags are in great condition but my K√•nken has survived the most wear and tear.

Remember quality over everything. A pricier backpack or laptop bag > cheap one that'll rip in a year or two. 

A 25 or 30L backpack with a laptop compartment is amazing. You can fit so much in it and they're not that large cuz they have nice compartmentalization. 

I myself have a leather laptop/messenger bag that fists my laptop in its sleeve, notepad, 2-3 notebooks, all my chargers and pens and highlighters. I just don't like the look of backpacks but they're more comfortable and spacious‚Ä¶
