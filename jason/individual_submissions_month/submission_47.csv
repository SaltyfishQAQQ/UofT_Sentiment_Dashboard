I have received my OSSD yet UofT says I have not met the conditions,Educational-One-4576,1m3w3dt,https://i.redd.it/g15ertuk0udf1.jpeg,1752931247.0,"I received an email yesterday telling me that UofT says that their records don't say I completed the OSSD requirements. When I look at my academic record on OUAC, it says that I received my OSSD, and I can confirm that I definitely did. A bunch of my friends are having the same issue, even ones going to Waterloo and Western. Has anyone else had this problem?",submission,24

It’s NOT JUST YOU, they have received countless calls. Here’s what you do: call your high school. The guidance dept at ours manually updated ‘received OSSD’ within the system and that will flow through to OUAC. 
I’m not taking chances…I might get the high school to give me a copy of my son’s transcripts (must be sealed) and we’ll deliver them to the school ourselves if we don’t hear any updates tomorrow (Monday).",comment,1
