A little context: I just finished my first year at UofT and have been taking some classes over the summer. I'm in science, and unfortunately, I failed one class in my first semester and did pretty poorly in a lot of the classes I had to do well to go into the field that I wanted to. I retook the class that I failed in summer and managed to get a pretty alright mark, but I am now taking a second year class to get ahead because I heard that some summer classes are easier and I have found that to be true until a week ago. I received my midterm mark back after studying for almost a week and got a failing grade, and not just any failing grade. I think I must have done the worst in the class (The average was around 71%. I got around a 40%). I genuinely have no words for myself and have been in a depressive episode ever since getting my mark back a week ago. I feel as though no matter how hard I try, no matter how much I study, no matter how much effort I put in, I always fail. I think to this date I have failed more midterms than I have passed and I'm not sure if I have test-taking anxiety, but whenever I am doing work by myself, it comes to me easily and i can work well without outside help. But when it comes down to writing a test, I'm not sure what comes over me, but I just always perform so badly. I think with every failed test my anxiety just grows more and more so that when it comes time to write the next one i feel even worse. I had so many big hopes for myself when I came to UofT. I was planning on going into the specialization I wanted, finding a career in a city that I really liked and starting up my life. But now I'm not sure if that'll be the case. Please, if any of you have been through this and know anything I can try, I feel like the dumbest person in the world right now frankly.",submission,44

Unfortunately, university can be a huge reality check (believe me, I know). The fact is, you don't need to be very smart to cram a bunch of facts in your brain for a test. Your poor performance is almost certainly due to bad study techniques, poor discipline, or test anxiety.

Don't stress over how 'smart' you are. You can do well at UofT as long as you put in the effort.

What are your current study strategies like? Do you find that you can comprehend the lecture material well? Have you sought out assistance at all?",comment,11

The University of Toronto is tough, and you‚Äôre definitely not alone‚ÄîI‚Äôve been in the same situation myself.

I know it‚Äôs frustrating when it feels like your effort isn‚Äôt reflected in your results. But if you‚Äôre passing, try not to be too hard on yourself. Focus on improving step by step. Sometimes it‚Äôs not just about how hard you work, but also about finding the right strategies‚Äîlike better time management or different study methods.

It might help to speak with your registrar or academic advisor. U of T offers various workshops and resources that can support you with study skills, time management, and even mental health.

What helped me personally was only focusing on the professor‚Äôs material. I also practiced a lot with past midterms and finals. And don‚Äôt underestimate assignments‚Äîthey can be a great way to boost your grade and give you more breathing room during exams.

Also, consider lightening your course load if things feel too overwhelming. You can always take a course or two in the summer to catch up. It‚Äôs okay to adjust your pace‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt a race, it‚Äôs a marathon.

Lastly, don‚Äôt let grades define your self-worth. It sucks when you don‚Äôt get the mark you hoped for, but in the long run, your experience and resilience will matter far more than any single grade.

Hang in there, and be kind to yourself. You‚Äôre doing your best‚Äîand that counts.",comment,8

Luckily, you're still early into your uni career. Summer classes are fast-paced and can be as challenging as regular classes. Could you talk with an academic advisor or a learning strategist to find ways to study?  Also find a study group or buddy to keep u accountable, that worked really well for me. Chin up, you'll be alright",comment,3

Since you're taking courses all year long without a break in the summer, combined with the stress, you've surely did some damage to your mental health. 

Don't let failure keep you from succeeding, a failed class or even a few won't matter if you continue to pace yourself, know your limits and succeed your way. I'd say take a break, maybe a few days just not thinking about school, then come back and see how you feel. Also, remember that uoft is known for being difficult and making its students cry, so you're not alone. 

As for the test-anxiety thing, I'd try to focus on methods to clear your mind during an exam. This may sound a bit strange, but I've always found essential oils to help me calm down before a test and stay focused. other than that, talking to people in-person, seeking extra help from a prof or even meditation can all help you cope with pre-test anxiety. You may not be able to control your reaction, but you can help yourself overcome it.",comment,3

I was in a pretty similar situation myself and also finished my first year not doing so well either where I end up dropping two courses and making up for the credits in the summer. I think first year classes are generally speaking to general and I think once you find the thing you‚Äôre interested or start doing more specialized courses in later years, things will get better. 

I think something that really helped was knowing what was manageable in terms of load (maybe taking a reduced course load if needed) as well as being aware of what I struggled in (i.e passive study methods like reading off notes, cramming last minute and not giving myself enough hours of sleep, time management) and then figuring out better ways to go about things. I‚Äôd also strongly suggest if you have friends in science or even people from labs and tutorials, I‚Äôd take a few pointers of how they maybe study or even asking for help/ working together makes a huge difference. Something that helped me turn around my marks and my habits was the fact that by second semester, I had spent more time doing assignments and reaching out to both my lab partners from semester 1 and 2 whenever I needed help with practice questions and worked through lab assignments. On the side, I also took note of how they went about their lifestyle choices (like with time management and good things with how they went about being overall balanced as a person) and started implementing what they did that worked. It doesn‚Äôt hurt to see what you could do better through other people that might be doing the same courses + good to learn through ‚Äúosmosis‚Äù as I‚Äôd like to say. 

Lastly, I want to reassure you that success does come with failure and I think you can really turn it around if you put your mind to it (which I know you can). First year transition is difficult and allow yourself to breathe a bit. I heard success stories where people have gone from an extremely low gpa from first to a much higher one by 3rd/4th and by then you‚Äôre probably used to the pace and how to manage school, it‚Äôs going to be ok. Hope this helps and you‚Äôre free to reach out if needed!",comment,2

There's a massive learning curve between high school and university, and it takes a while to adjust. 

This is so common and expected, that grad schools usually don't consider the first two years of undergrad when deciding admissions. 

Not that being common helps what you're feeling. But just know you're not alone. You're not a failure. You're at the start of a journey and there will always be stumbles. It's stupid, but the old adage of what doesn't kill you makes you stronger is true. You'll learn from this. You'll learn how you need to adjust your schedule, or remove distractions. Or you'll learn how you study best. 

Book a meeting with your program advisor. hopefully they'll be able to give you a game plan. 

You got this.",comment,2

It's easy to feel so bad about yourself after failing to meet expectations, but something I just recently learned is that although you may think you've already lost, the fact that you're still here shows that you haven't failed yet. Just because you didn't do well in your first year, it doesn't mean it's over and the best thing you can do is stay determined and keep doing what you can",comment,1
