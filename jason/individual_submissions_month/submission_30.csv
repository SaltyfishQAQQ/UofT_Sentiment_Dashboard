Have You Been Able to Find a Date Ever Since Coming into U of T?,At_Space_Station,1mh4u4z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mh4u4z/have_you_been_able_to_find_a_date_ever_since/,1754284561.0,"So I’ve started to think about dating lately. I’ve never done it in U of T, even though I’m heading into my third year.

There’s lots of time and places to talk to others on campus I find, yet I never tried go ask a date. I just thought I wasn’t good enough to go beyond being friends, or worse that we get awkward and alienating potential friends.

But just for referencing. Have any of you been able to ask someone out. What’s like the success rate of just getting out there?

Also, I really need to find a roommate, that’s another practical reason why I’ve been trying to get dating.

Any good advice appreciated. Thank you for reading.",submission,52

The more you obsess over it, the more energy you drain. 

If things happen naturally, only then go with the flow. Or else, focus on your work. 

I strongly advise against dating in the undergrad program, as I have been a TA for undergrads for 2 years, I've seen very horrible cases of people falling behind while trying to love someone, it just gets ugly. It's gonna drain your energy, either way, as it's a responsibility. A relationship to pass time is a myth. You have a lot of trade-offs, and one of them is your future trajectory, too. Being a TA for these kids, I was able to help them out emotionally, mentally, in my capacity to accommodate them in the course.

In my deeply personal opinion, UofT is a horrible place to date, and Toronto is practically the most difficult place to make friends in to begin with. Especially during my master's, people from my diaspora were horrible, especially with the opposite genders. The graduate crowd is extremely toxic as it gets because most of the international folks are in the fight for survival. In their vulnerability, there is a high chance that they'd exhibit fucked up behavior. 

I'd rather be sane than sorry. But I don't deny that nothing is possible. It is possible if things go naturally without causing you massive trouble or hinder/deviate you from your trajectory, maybe start talking to people upfront? 

Find love that supports you, not the superficial one aggravates your misery. I've seen shit, I'd want you to be safe and sane.",comment,8

advice: just go out and do stuff (volunteering, partying, talking during lectures, whatever it may be), and if you meet someone you click with, ask them out. the success rate will vary from person to person, so just do it regardless of the ""success rate"". also, strike a conversation first; randomly approaching people asking for their numbers isn't the best idea.

personally would not ask any out any co-workers, but that's up to your discretion.",comment,2
