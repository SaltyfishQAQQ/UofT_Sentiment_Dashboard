We‚Äôre both girls, both so chill match each other‚Äôs vibe so well, met frequently and spoke to each other every day almost, and now I don‚Äôt know what to do. I also reached out to her multiple times, called and texted her, also left a long note explaining and asking what went wrong. She recently traveled for a week so we didn‚Äôt talk that much but ever since she‚Äôs been back, she‚Äôs ghosted me entirely, removed her location and not answering anything. I even texted her sister on ig lol.

The irony is that we used to be so big on communication, especially with one another, and I thought that she‚Äôs one of my closest ever friends whom I‚Äôve confided in. 

What should I do I mean at the end of the day if something is wrong I just wanna clear things up and have no stress. I never really fight with any of my friends or have problems with anyone so this is honestly a shock to me. Am I tweaking?",submission,32

Sadly, you need to let go. I would say, that anyone that treats you like this, does not deserve your friendship. She is being childish and disrespectful of your feelings and you don‚Äôt need anyone like that. Let it go. Be mad at her for how she is treating you. Just turn your back and do not look back. Like the song says ‚Äú now you are someone that I used to know‚Äù‚Äô
Good luck.",comment,23

You‚Äôve already tried actively asking and radio silence. What more can you genuinely do? You even went as far as texting her sister (albeit not certain how that went) which shows how much you cared.

If you got her number which I suppose you do have just go around any restaurants/cages/bars .. any public places which have washrooms and in the washrooms' on the door inside the washrooms' write her number and under that write ""looking for fun with a winky face"" or something like that 

Hope this helps :)",comment,3

I don't understand people like this either. They're so rude. If you don't intend on maintaining friendship, why bother in the first place on starting one? But know that you are not at fault. This happened a lot to me in my first year. Actually, I will speak to someone for an entire semester. Sit next to them. Speak every single day exchange social media study for exams and final together and then suddenly if I don't make the effort for one day it's as if we never spoke in the beginning at all. 


These sort of people always expect other people to reach out or hang out first and when they feel like that their needs are not being met. They kind of move on. Another  comment also mention that she may have potentially met a boy who is preoccupying her time and you are just a placeholder. Male-centered women are some of the worst and it's kind of embarrassing when it follows them outside of high school.


In my experience you just got to move on. I'm sorry this happened to you and I know that it can be very discouraging with reaching out to other people and making other friends in your class. But trust me, it is within your best interest to just move on with your life and find someone else who is just as willing to pursue a friendship with you as you are with them.

 Remember that friendship is a two-way street. If you're always the one reaching out and asking to hang out, chances are they think of you as a background character. Unfortunately, people like this exist a lot in university. I heard it's more so common at the university of Toronto, but move on stop chasing her. It's not worth it.",comment,5
