Social Sciences (except political science) - Almost all left wing, at least liberal.  
Humanities - Left or Liberal  
Political science - Mixed  
Engineering - Centrist or right  
Life Sciences - Liberal  
Physical Sciences - Centrist or right  
Computer science - Mixed  
Business - Centrist or right

Don't focus on this too much tho, there is plenty of political diversity at UofT in all groups.  Don't avoid groups of people just because of my opinion, I might not even be correct.",comment,87

I lived in Victoria College and the community there is pretty ubiquitously left-leaning to centrist. Any sort of large C Conservatism is socially discouraged and may get you labelled. But most people are liberal in the sense that they value free expression and other civil liberties. 

In the broader university, there's more diversity and - as another poster noted - varies considerably from one department to the next. Humanities = left, Sciences = centre, Engineering = centre, PoliSci = centre/right. 

I think you should develop your political thought independently in university, and U of T certainly allows you to do so with opportunities to debate your viewpoint and discuss politics in different social settings. In my experience, these forums could get heated and emotional but that's just part of life. You'll be fine - just focus on your views and don't let other people bother you.",comment,3

I would say that a lot of people are willing to talk about municipal policies and city planning but not federal politics. I've had interesting conversations about transit (bike lanes, TTC payment structures, congestion on the road), housing (homeless encampments, mid sized housing, zoning laws, parking requirements), position of hospitals (most are downtown, good/bad?), library services ect. However if you get into international matters you will not get anything past ""It's sad war exist, we should all just get along"", no one talks about indigenous peoples (all conversation will get shut down), and people are uninformed about reproductive regulations though they will listen intently.

Most people align with right ideology, personal freedom >government. But don't agree with traditional right policies. For example many people I've spoken to say that bikes and public transit allow for more autonomous transportation over cars. They don't like zoning laws and say its government overreach to limit builders to single story dwellings.  Both of these ideas I associate more with the left.",comment,1

People are just cadaverous with sunken eyes, staring at the ground as the roam the halls of the school. Political culture?! The only culture there seems to be is the culture of fast-walking people who need to get from point A to point B in 45 seconds or less in a campus that’s the size of 165 football fields. Literally, NO ONE cares about politics. Once class is over, everyone dips out of sight, and out of nowhere too. Their either vanish completely out of thin air, morph into the walls, or somehow fly away and phase through the roof to escape into freedom. You’ll be lucky to have a conversation with Casper about any sort of politics once class is over. “Cash me outside, how bout that?” is NOT one of the catch phrases that flourish within UofT St. George because I can assure you that, absolutely NO ONE is outside to catch any sort of care about politics.

It's a privilege to be able to engage in ""controversial topics"" without being ""intense."" Plus, it's pretty reductive to say that these conversations don't exist just because they don't welcome conservative values. There are more ways to contribute to the discussion than playing devil's advocate.

And if it makes you feel any better: liberalism =/= leftism, and even humanities courses/professors are largely liberal, not leftist. Plenty of liberal racists, sexists, conservatives, etc.. here whose entire careers in humanities/socsci depend on the ability to entertain ""both sides.""
