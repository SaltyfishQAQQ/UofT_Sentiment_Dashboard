I‚Äôm an incoming second year and I unfortunately have a rare disorder that has impacted my life a lot over the past couple years. having gone through the extensive process of tests, appointments, gaslighting medical professionals, attempts for remedies, medications , and everything else ‚Ä¶ i‚Äôve developed a passion for spreading awareness about these issues. i went years without diagnosis because no one knew about my issue (i even had doctors and SURGEONS tell me that my diagnosis ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt exist‚Äù). 
NORD is the National Organization for Rare Disorders and they support and provide resources for many clubs and councils in different high schools and universities (ex TMU, Mcmaster, mcgill, etc)
Part of me wants to start a NORD club at uoft but i am not someone who has experience starting/leading initiatives and i def wouldn‚Äôt want to put effort into something that doesn‚Äôt spark interest to anyone else. 
If anyone thinks this is something they would be interested in pls dm me cause i would only do so if i had a group of likeminded ppl on board",submission,20
