I counted my credits wrong and I'm worried I won't be able to graduate,Stunning-Display-783,1m61f7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m61f7k/i_counted_my_credits_wrong_and_im_worried_i_wont/,1753148657.0,"Hi,

I'm just really anxious and scared right now, so I'd really appreciate any advice or support I can get.

I was originally intending on graduating this coming fall, and I should have all the credits I need to graduate - actually I have 20.50 credits in total, so I have an extra 0.50 credits.

The problem is that when I was planning my courses, I must have miscounted the number of credits I needed in 200- and 300-level courses, which is such a stupid mistake on my end, so I'm going to have 5.50/6.00 credits at the 300-level by the time this summer semester is over, in time for Fall Convocation. It's also too late for me to register for any courses this summer.

This is really bad - I'm already registered for graduate school in the fall as well and I'm worried my plan for the next two years is going to fall apart. Does anyone have any advice or suggestions on what I can do so I can make sure I graduate in the Fall? I'm going to talk to my registrar ASAP. Would it be possible at all for me to ask for them to waive the third requirement or make an exception seeing as I've also taken extra courses?

Edit: I'm not sure if it matters but I should also mention that I'll have definitely completed all of my program requirements by the end of this summer.",submission,25

That's the thing you should be looking at, not pen and paper calculations...

If it were a problem with program requirements, you could look into whether there's there a way to still graduate by changing your program selection.  e.g. If you were planning on graduating w/ a specialist, can you drop that down to a major and two minors or to two majors or something in a way that allows you to graduate.

If it's really a degree requirement, I'm stumped.   I don't know if there's any flexibility when it comes to degree requirements.  If it's the ""At least 6.0 at the 300/400-level"" requirement then have a very good look at your 200-level courses and see if any of them could possibly be argued to be at a higher level than their number?  (Sort of how MAT223 should be counted as being at the 100 level despite its number.)  If this is something that the department of said course would back you on as being true, this could be a tree to bark up.

Otherwise, not all graduate programs require an undergraduate degree.  I know someone who went into a PhD program without having completed their bachelor's degree.  Is there any hope in a) finding an online course at the 300+ level and b) contacting the graduate program that's admitted you to find out if they'd be okay w/ your completing your degree in December?  (They may not be amused by your splitting your attention in this way but it's better than having to defer the graduate program by a year...  unless it's a graduate program that would allow you to start in January...)

To find online courses, go to timetable builder and choose UTM+UTSC+FAS and under ""show more filters"" you can select courses at the 300+ level and online courses.  I see 42 options when I do this.",comment,9

You can contact the registrar ASAP and see if there is a 300 + self paced elective you can enroll in now to complete now. Alternatively you will have to do a course to finish so look now for what you can register for for the Fall and make sure you only have to pay for the single course.,comment,4

Fortunately you caught it now rather than later but seems like rn you’re changes are getting that degree requirement modified for you or you having to take one more course in the Fall to eventually graduate in summer 2026,comment,2
