The main Study Permit paperwork is to prevent people from people using Student Visas to work in Canada. I doubt a student from the country's top university will be denied unless there is something seriously wrong.

Also, I got an award and deferred it, which apparently took care of the minimum payment. Fortunately, I am nowhere close to a situation as complicated as yours.",comment,1

It‚Äôs better to call International Student Services for clarification. I also have international friends who submitted their study permit applications without paying, and they got rejected just last week.

They might treat your case differently since you‚Äôre a protected person, but as far as I know, all international students are expected to pay upfront to confirm their enrollment. This helps IRCC see that you‚Äôre serious about your studies.",comment,1
