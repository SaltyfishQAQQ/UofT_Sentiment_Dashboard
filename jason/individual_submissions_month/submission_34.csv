***tl;dr skip to the bottom for the table I made of courses, their course averages, and at the bottom of the table the average cGPA of all the students who took those courses. I calculated the average cGPA to be 2.7525***

After graduating with my double major in mathematics and statistics last month, I looked back on all the years I'd spent toiling away at problem sets and studying intensely for back to back midterms and thought to myself: Did I do good?

Then, I remembered that I have access to the average final grade for every single one of my past courses on Acorn, which I then compiled into a table and using [UofT's official gpa weighting scheme](https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/records-academics/transcripts/grading-scales-notations/) I computed the average cGPA to be ***2.7525*** (or 2.76 since UofT often rounds up to the nearest hundredth).

  
Please take this information with a grain of salt, as this is ONLY reflective of people who took every single course I took in the exact same sessions as I did with the exact same professors. If you did not study mathematics and statistics, this number could be wildly lower or higher depending on what you did study! However, I think that this is somewhat representative of the mathematical and physical sciences as there is a lot of overlap between departments there.

  
Here is the table where I calculated all this information, I also reviewed each course and gave it a bird score and ""fun"" score!

Notes to clarify why you should take this information with a grain of salt:

Just for further clarification, this is by no means a perfect representation of the entire student body of UofT, not even within the mathematical and physical sciences department. Although most of the courses I took were pre-requisites for my programs, class sizes varied (between 30-1000 students), and there is quite possibly 0 students at UofT who I shared all of my classes with me for my entire undergrad. 

UofT’s official GPA calculator calculates gpa as a weighted average, taking into consideration credits taken vs letter grade. Additionally, UofT does not award gpa points on a linear scale (i.e. an A+=4.0=A, but an A-=3.7) If by random chance in every course I took the class got 86% as their true average grade, then that would mean the difference between a 3.7 average and a 4.0 average for every course. Obviously this is unlikely but not impossible.

The reason I decided to publish this is to provide the best evidence I could have what the true average cGPA could be for UofT students. I’ve seen people anecdotally express that it probably hovers between 2.5 and 3.5, but without any sort of evidence to back it up. The only way to find quality information about this would to actually conduct a survey on UofT students or to obtain information from the university, both of which I didn’t try very hard at and may be possible for you to do.

The only conclusions you can certainly draw from this data is that getting a C+ or higher in my program would have been above average in many of the pre-requisite courses I took, and this information can help set the standard for future students, who, like I did in first year, were devastated with their first grade in a course that wasn’t an A or B. Besides that, it’s just a snapshot into an entire 4 years.",submission,41

It's already an accomplishment to receive your degree no matter your GPA. 

When I was an engineering undergrad, they used to publish your class rank based on your average numeric grade (e.g. ""you ranked 50th out of 230 students""). 

One interesting thing was that engineering grades were sometimes quite bimodal. So I was surprised to see a chunk of people who'd get As and A+s, and a chunk who straight up failed. 

It was personally flattering (or humbling) to see that even if you do really poorly in a course, there are likely many people worse or as bad as you are. The opposite is true too. I think you did plenty well.",comment,3

This isn’t even considering that even if someone took the exact same courses as you in the same session, the average gpa formula is different than how you presented it, because you aggregated it by course rather than by individual.

Cool information nonetheless.",comment,1

I have a hunch that the difference would stem from people taking the more advanced courses. STA237, MAT137, and STA238 have more advanced alternatives, and several other courses I took have alternatives as well. I’d be curious to see what the average gpa looks like for someone who took the “harder” courses.

However, right now I can’t imagine any better alternatives to collecting this data without going through the university or doing a hefty survey.

If I knew the actual number of students in each course, the true cGPA calculation formula (mine is based off applying a weighted average to my own gpa, which matched acorn), then I think it would be a tiny bit more representative of the broader student body. 

I’ll make an edit to my original post addressing the caveats more clearly.",comment,3
