From my understanding, it seem to be a record of all extracurricular stuff you've done during your degree. So I was wondering if it was worth it to invest some of my time for it?

Thank you!",submission,14

It's a great way to meet new people, it can be a lot of fun, and depending on what you get involved in, it can open up interesting opportunities and provide you with some great experiences. 

This makes me sound ancient, but I was actually an undergraduate in a undergrad leadership position who was consulted about the implementation of the CCR. The thing is, nothing like this exists outside of U of T. The idea was/is for it to be a transcript of extracurriculars that U of T verifies and you can use to show employers that you were involved. My experience, and the experience of the people that I graduated with/worked with in extracurricular roles, is that employers don't know what it is, and they don't really care. 

If they're interested in your extracurricular activities - which, for me at least, many of them were - they just take your word for it. They aren't calling U of T to ask if you were a member of the dance team. They don't contact UTSU to verify if you actually served as president of a course union. They're not expecting a paper trail, and so they don't ask for it. 

It's kind of fun to have the CCR, but no one has ever asked me for it or given it more than a passing glance, in a like 'oh, neat,' kind of way. 

So, getting involved and investing time in an extracurricular? 10/10 would recommend. But putting in time to make sure the CCR is up to date and accurate and all that - probably not worth that much of your time.",comment,17

Overall - yes.

It’s a mixed batch:

There are some positions that are CCR approved that don’t provide much: just participating in a one time event for example and filling out a reflection.

While others are more long term and require some sort of leadership and decision making. The latter being more helpful to keep track of and can be really useful for job applications as a way to attest to your skills. 

So overall I’d recommend it.",comment,1

If you are doing activities you enjoy and by filling out a little end-of-year survey or something, you are able to get a CCR credit, then absolutely go for it! But if you're slogging through several workshops just for the sake of a CCR credit, you're wasting your time.

What is actually worth investing your time into is extracurricular/leadership activities on campus. The soft skills and experiences you gain are more valuable and give you things to point to as proof of your competency at teamwork, communication, etc when you have grad school applications or job interviews.",comment,1

Unless you're from social science or humanities, who probably wouldn't graduate with any kind of employable technical skill and have to make a living as some kind of woo-woo man or grifter

Jesus. Your posts are all obsessing over soc sci and humanities students. Why does it trigger you so much? It’s not like CS students have the best reputation in terms of jobs rn. But no one’s hating on you.

Sure technical skills are important if your job requires them. But also good luck getting employed at a good job when you automatically assume you’re better than the others around you. You attract what you put into the world.",comment,2
