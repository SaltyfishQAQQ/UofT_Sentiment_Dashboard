I mean which program you find enjoyable in the content and teaching quality and just makes you wanna learn more about the topic. This can be your current program, or your minor program, or something you gave up but did like.

For me it’s Political Science. I like seeing political topics, at least the ones in Pol Sci courses have always been cool. Some profs and TAs are absolute up there. 

Some examples of fun POL classes are 107 (March of folly, it’s almost like watching a History channel show), 208 (introduction international relationship, goes to every factor in examining history, war, state competency, human nature, and sprinkled with economic ideas too), and maybe 109 (war, it’s like 208 but even simpler)",submission,12
