He also said he's going to ride the TTC every day to figure out what's wrong. I'm sure anyone who's taken either the 504, 501, line 1, Line 2, or legit just gotten on a shuttle bus or been stuck because of an emergency situation at Lawerence station knows how insufferable just getting around toronto is, and expecially how unreliable it can be for getting to class or even exams ontime is. I hope he uses student voices to impliment better changes to the ttc, including better discounts and fairs. Have almost missed 30 minutes of an exam because of delays on line 1/2. I have not gone to some classes because of issues. I feel like uoft students (maybe even get TMU and OCAD students) should send a letter addressing issues cause at least this dude seems like he cares enough and has a lot of experience. I'm just tired of having to add a whole extra 2 hours sometimes to my day because of closures and disruptions ",submission,80

There have been some excellent proposals to improve transit in the city, like expanding the GO train network, and RapidTO.
