So it could be that there are faculty whose teaching assignments are yet to be solidified.  Or...

There could be sessionals who still need to be hired for some instructorship positions.  Sessionals = graduate student course instructors, postdoctoral fellow course instructors, course instructors from the outside hired because of special expertises.

Like I bet they have an idea of what prof is teaching what course but it’s not 100% either due to prof availability or another reason,comment,12

Before a class even ended a prof was telling us about one he was teaching this upcoming year and it was listed as TBA until recently. 
Also had a prof last year who could t even updated the querus page because he wasn’t even in the system (only got it sorted the first day of lecture, he was frustrated!)",comment,3

Then I go see course X on acorn/TTB and all sections say ""TBA"" lol. I understand there's so much planning involved in such a huge uni, but I just foolishly wish they would get posted before we are stuck in a section with no possibility of switching due to all being full. :/",comment,-1

If they haven't received work authorization yet, they might not want to list them on acorn/TTB until they know for sure that the person can teach. 

Dumb to put it on LinkedIn if that's the case though.",comment,5
