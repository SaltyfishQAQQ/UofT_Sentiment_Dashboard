Is UofT Worth it? [Questions from a High School Student],Consistent-Rule-894,1m56klg,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m56klg/is_uoft_worth_it_questions_from_a_high_school/,1753063152.0,"Hi!

I am currently entering my grade 12 year in an Ontario High School and since I was in grade 9 UofT was seen as this coveted university that everyone should strive to want to go to. I truly wanted to go to UofT (St George Campus) for the longest time but I recently went to Montreal and visited McGill and my mind has been shifted. 

I am going to write bullet points on the observations or questions that worry me about every going to school in UofT or Downtown Toronto in general. 

* Can I actually get a real job that will pay a livable wage after a BA?
* Do people live on res even after 1st year? If not where do they go? Toronto is expensive, so I don't understand how a college student would be able to afford an apartment within the city
* I understand UofT is not a party school. But are there any activities that are done within the school that do a good job at fostering community
* I want to study Humanities/SocSci and I know people call UofT the university of tears but is it as tearful in that faculty?

All these points leading to my overarching question that:

**IS GOING TO UOFT, OR EVEN CONSIDERING IT WORTH IT?**",submission,12

A degree is only as valuable as the effort you put into it. If it's going to classes with the readings already done or the essay that's due in 3 months already finished, or doing the optional readings or even doing the unassigned questions in a textbook (hint: sometimes they show up on tests). Your degree is only as valuable as the effort YOU put into it. 

Going to your profs office hours with questions, reading the syllabus, joining a club, talking with your classmates, making lifelong friends its all possible but you have to put the effort in because no one else will especially at UofT.

This applies to basically every program at UofT but first year your usually not in your final program and a lot of smart people fail for the first time in there lives while some people thrive. 

Your job might not be related to your degree at the end - but if you put in the effort you can get the skills to succeed in almost any program.

It is possible to coast and in some programs coasting will still get you a job - but in most of the social sciences / humanities coasting isn't good enough.",comment,17

Is UofT Worth it? [Questions from a High School Student],Old-Mycologist1654,n4b0w7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m56klg/is_uoft_worth_it_questions_from_a_high_school/n4b0w7n/,1753085409.0,"If you want to go to the St George campus (or McGill for that matter) for the ambiance (Ivy in the walls, Harry Potter-esque archetecture), you are making a mistake. Nobody (I mean employers) cares which campus you went to after you graduate. 

1. With a BA in Humanities / Social Sciences, probably no, you cannot get a job with that in Ontario and especially not in the Greater Toronto Area (if you mean something other than store-level retail, or maybe teaching English at an eikaiwa in a mall in Japan, or as an Assistant language teacher). Many people do a postgrad through an Ontario college (Humber, Centennial etc) to get a internship /  placement in their field. Or teacher's college etc. Scarborough campus has co-op programs and joint programs with Centennial so you graduate with qualifications from both. They may have the best chance for a job after graduation for Humanities area grads. 

2 Toronto is expensive. It's one of the most expensive cities in the world. There are two other campuses. You can get a place to live for a lot less if you go to either of the other campuses (often a single room in a house [with a key lock on the door] with a shared kitchen and bathroom). You may end up getting a bus in, though. Probably most of the student population at the other campuses are communters who live with their family. I would say most students do not live in apartments when they go to UofT. OTOH you can get a room out in Scarborough or Mississauga and commute into Toronto. 
 
3. You should choose where you go based on costs and also where the programs are available. If you want to major in English lit, then you can do that at any of the campuses. Or at York etc. If you want to do a program that is ONLY available at the St George campus, then maybe you will find that McGill doesn't have that program either. If you want to major in French, then yeah, McGill would be better (so would Ottawa U, or Glendon College of York U) for just being surrounded by it almost all the time. If you want to major in English, look at the courses available at different universities. The way English is taught at York U is quite different from the way it's taught at UofT. 

I skipped your community question. The answer is that that's entirely up to you. There are clubs at all three campuses. It isn't uncommon to spend years at UofT or any other university and have pretty good acquaintances within individual classes (and individual clubs), but nobody you really hang out with outside of school (one of the reasons schools advertise that you can make life-long friends in cohort programs like postgrads is because that is rare in tertiary education). If you live in shared housing, maybe the people you live with will become your defacto group of friends. But maybe not. If you look around, you'll see a lot of people who are just by themselves when they aren't in classes. Commuters take classes and then go home or to their part-time jobs (and their circle of friends is probably centeted around their high school friends who are also commuters, and often to other schools / campuses). People who live off campus (but maybe not with their family) may be leaving to go sit by themselves and watch Netflicks in the room they rent if they aren't going to their p/t job. The truth is that the stereotype of the person returning home to do laundry is often returning home out of loneliness. It's just part of growing up. So if you're a Humanities / Social Science major, it helps if you are msjoring in something that you really, really like.",comment,7

I'll reiterate what others are saying too, you are what you make of your own educational experience!

And no most don't live on res after first year. Most people I know are looking for apartments that have a 30 minute or less commute time. this is extremely doable. I am saying that as someone who used to commute nearly 3 hours one way and am now commuting 1.5 one way. 

it depends on your faculty/specialization for the activity stuff. there are LOADS of clubs and sports to be done! attend orientation and club fair (forgot exactly what it's called) and  you'll be able to join something fun. I'm in Architecture and the community there is quite tight knit, I love my community. I know it's much harder to find community in larger faculties (like life sci for example lol) but thats where clubs should come in.

Humanities is very very easy, according to the one humanities student I know (who promptly transferred out of Humanities into arch). I think the level of difficulty grossly depends on what you're studying. Also, yes UofT is on general a tougher grader because of its image.

I'm speaking from personal experience (i go to the utsg campus and I'm entering 2nd year),  but I'd say it's certainly worth considering. I'm not sure if there is, but I hope there are some opportunities for you to talk to some real students in the program you're interested in, so you can find out what the workload/vibes are like.",comment,2

Either way you would be moving to a new city right? Toronto is insanely expensive yes. As a UofT, grad it is over rated. 

If you liked Montreal I would seriously consider that. Uoft isn’t bad but it. But It gets to you after a while. So does Toronto. Since you have time, I would visit both campuses. Attend classes even if you want, at uoft you can just walk in.

In terms of “ranking” don’t look at that. No one cares. Uoft is overated in that sense. Look at the program, the uni, the city. 

You need more information. Look at the programs, look at both perspectives. 

Anyways apply to both. There’s no guarantee you’ll get into both (uoft most like yes, as the the strategy is to accept all and weed out later through first year classes).

A college degree won’t get you a job. It’s what you do with it. It’s the experience and the people you meet. It just gives you the structure. You have to make the most of it (not by studying all the time for example but by meeting people, profs, etc).",comment,1

When I was in grade 9 I wanted uoft st. george but after I had a friend who got into st. george, she tells me how long it takes her to get her next class bc how big that campus is. Toronto is not only an expensive but a dangerous city with many homeless.  When you are applying don't look at what is ""aesthetic"", you should think about how you will go to school for 4 years everyday, in winter and summer. like how far is it? where will i live? can i afford this? I feel like I made the right choice choosing a closer campus to my house, as it will be morre comfortable to commute, if you don't drive.",comment,1

Making friends is definitely doable, especially if you live on res the first year. Clubs can be a difficult to find, but they're there

The humanities are...not awful? There are some classes that can be a bit brutal, but it's generally not that bad as long as you try. Professors are usually pretty good too. I study English/polisci/philosophy, if that helps.",comment,1

I wouldn’t say eg Art history major (no offence! Sorry) you’ll be on a livable wage after BA. I don’t know about social science though. I’m in finance and most new grads will still need roommates for abit.

2: I lived on res for 3 years, lived in annex area for my last year, there are great apartments that’s rather affordable with roommates and very convenient for day to day life and walking to school 

3: student clubs are great I highly recommend you joining maybe 2. One specific to your area of study for networking resource purposes and one for recreational (sports/hobbies etc) that will also expose you to a good mix of people

4: not my area but commerce was also pretty stressful, average was like a 70 for most courses. 

I’m not sure if McGill still charge the same tuition to out of province students? I believe I heard they charge more now. Personally I think I might have gone to Ivey instead but that’s cause I’m in finance (eg CS I would say go to Waterloo). Cant comment much on social sciences but generally it’s easier to network for jobs when you’re already studying in the city you plan to work in so that should be a consideration as well.",comment,1
