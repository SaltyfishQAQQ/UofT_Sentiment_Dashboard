Or if they can, make some of the existing tutorials bigger. So it would probably be best to enroll into the main lecture and wait",comment,34

When a tutorial is opened, it is nearly impossible to close it again. Thus every department is conservative about how many lectures and tutorials it initially offers. As enrollment numbers become solid, if more spots are needed, more will open. 


Also, this is a winter course. Enrollment numbers won't be solid for this course until late December. A bunch of students will drop/fail MAT135 before then, meaning that more spots will become available. 


Also, it's UofT (what do you think the F stands for? It's in the sub name), learn to use some punctuation, and calm down.",comment,17

Separately, you could contact the UTM MCS department to let them know that this is happening.  They may not have spotted it yet.

1. Alex is well aware of exactly how many tutorials need to be opened.

2. As I've mentioned, we will not even look at resolving this until the week before classes end in December.
