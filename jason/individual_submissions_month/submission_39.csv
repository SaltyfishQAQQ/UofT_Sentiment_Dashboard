I want to get in to the University of Toronto someday as a psych major but my dad continually sends me news of people who didn’t get in despite having good grades. Is there any ways that will make it easier besides the ‘just get good grades and do a sport’ technique?

Every person’s opinion is welcomed as this is my dream school and I’m hoping to become a doctor (specifically psychiatrist or neurologist)  someday.

For reference:

Math A: 80 (my teacher last year was awful)
Math B: 85
Science: 97
Arts: 97
P.E: 95
Health: 88
History: 93
French: 97
English A: 96
English B: 90 (different teacher)

GPA: 3.7 (hoping to get a 4.0 next year)

I have volunteered at my church every week since I was 9 and at SCAT ",submission,30

And then when I was like… 25? 27? Maybe younger, I forget. Anyway, I applied for the philosophy program through the adult education school at UofT, as recommended by a UofT philosophy friend to whom I had been introduced.

I had been reading a bunch of inspiring political and existentialist philosophy, and so in my application, I just poured my heart out, telling them how I’d like to use myself and this education to make the world a better place.

Which, at the time, and now sounds… ridiculous?


And so despite doing poorly in high school (late bloomer with respect to finding a love in reading and learning), and then doing really-really well in what I presume was an easier community college… I was accepted!

It still fills my heart with joy, and all the experiences I had while I was actively taking classes. And the intellectual stimulation in class, tutorials, at home, the bar, ahhhh. What a rich and valuable experience for a human mind.

Now, if only I could find the money and/or safe stable employment to continue taking classes. 😭

In time, I do hope.

So I just want to say that if you don’t make it in right away, don’t worry —maybe you can apply as a mature student, if your life leads you to travel or other opportunities or responsibilities, or setbacks, as often occur.

All the best,",comment,15

High School Diploma with five Grade 12 academic subjects numbered 30, including English Language Arts A30 and B30.

Calculus 30 or Calculus AP (AB or BC) is required for programs with the Calculus prerequisite.

Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses are acceptable.

Co-op courses, challenge exams, Applied Design, Skills and Technologies, Career Education and work experience courses will not be used for admission consideration.

Saskatchewan secondary school qualifications and course equivalents:
English	English A30 & English B30
Precalculus	Precalculus 30
Biology	Biology 30


Focus on getting high marks in the 5 course requirements, of which must include English, Precalculus and Biology.  The other courses do not matter but keep in mind you definitely do not want to be lost in first year science courses so would suggest looking at First Year curriculum requirements so you can prepare.   Life sciences I don’t think is particularly difficult. It will be more challenging getting into your 2nd Year Subject Post which assesses your 1st yr undergraduate marks.  Would suggest also looking into this ahead of time as well.

It doesn’t hurt to apply and your marks look pretty good! Give it a shot and try your hardest to get the best marks possible.",comment,2

Going to U of T for undergrad will make that needlessly more difficult than doing undergrad at most other schools. If you want to move away from home and come to Ontario, I’d consider other schools like Western or Queens for undergrad where it’s a bit easier to get that good GPA (and where they have a more fun / less crushing student culture) and then apply wherever for med school after.

As an aside, while it’s definitely *possible* to get into med school with any bachelor degree, if you’re focusing on psych major it may make taking the MCAT more challenging. I’d consider doing the typical pre-med stream focusing on your bio, chem, physiology etc, with a minor in psych.",comment,1

For McMaster they had sent too many acceptances out not expecting 2/3 of them will accept it! Due to this even the most qualifying students who had higher averages compared to those that got in with lower, they got rejected because there were no available seats for that many anymore. You're doing much better than I am, I think my average in my highschool was like a 3.7 you could say as in Canada we don't really use the GPA system until university.

I made 2 dark fantasy books (wrote, edited, formatted, published, and marketed them myself), and then last year, I applied to UofT downtown for English and Philosophy. Since I’m a lot older now (I’m 33) and I know those subjects are my passions, I only applied to those programs as a double major. 

So what did I do to get into UofT? I found my passion for not giving a flying £***€ about what anyone has to say and gained life experience by becoming a nurse and then became an author and THEN applied. And now I’m a happy student 🥹🙂

Ultimately the admission category isn't important (unless you're in the commerce of CS ones) in that anyone can study anything as long as they take the relevant courses.  You're more likely to get wait-listed for certain courses if you're in ""the wrong"" admission category but (e.g. if you're trying to get in BIO120 and you're not in the life sciences admission category) for most courses you'd ultimately get to take them, maybe not at the time of day you want or maybe a semester later than you want.

UTM and UTSC have their own admission categories and requirements [https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/future-students/admissions/application-process](https://www.utm.utoronto.ca/future-students/admissions/application-process) [https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/admissions/program-listing-categories](https://www.utsc.utoronto.ca/admissions/program-listing-categories) 

You can apply to all three of FAS, UTM, and UTSC and your diploma will say ""University of Toronto"" and that's what you would put on your resume.  You can find some data here [https://data.utoronto.ca/data-and-reports/facts-and-figures/facts-and-figures-students/](https://data.utoronto.ca/data-and-reports/facts-and-figures/facts-and-figures-students/)
