Is going to graduation/convocation ceremony worth it?,fineseriously,1lw2p8k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1lw2p8k/is_going_to_graduationconvocation_ceremony_worth/,1752118423.0,"I’m about to enter my last year and recently I’ve been thinking about not attending graduation. There are a couple of reasons. In short, none of friends are in my college (or are taking a 5th year instead) so I won’t have anyone to talk to during the ceremony and sitting for that long doesn’t seem particularly fun to me, and I honestly don’t find it super appealing overall. I was thinking about just renting the cap and gown to take photos with my friends and family but not attend the actual ceremony. Thinking back to high school graduation, the ceremony itself was quite boring but taking photos with friends and celebrating after was fun, which is why I’m thinking about potentially skipping this time around. 

For those who’ve graduated, what are your thoughts. Particularly interested to hear from both those who’ve attended and those who didn’t attend their ceremony. 

Alternatively, is there something I don’t know; eg. I can request to graduate with another college or maybe they group people also by majors/dept/last names, etc. ",submission,12

I also didn't know a ton of people there but it was still fun and it felt meaningful to actually properly graduate, even after being checked out for most of my last year.

I think if you've already put in 4+ years and tens of thousands of dollars, might as well go for one more day lol",comment,11

It was a big deal for us. By the time I graduated I was married, my kids were 9 and 11. They’d seen me doing my degree part-time for years, and they were all there for me. 

Watching my kids graduate was great. I flew to Vancouver to watch my daughter walk getting get her MA. 

For me, it was all about family and celebrating the accomplishments. 

My then future son in law (they’d recently started dating at the time) didn’t walk when he got his MA. He had no family there, didn’t care to walk. He doesn’t regret not walking. 

You should do what pleases you. If your family can and wants to come, absolutely do it. If you’re going to be on your own, and don’t value the ceremony, it’s not a big deal to miss it.",comment,6

Never regretted it personally! I went to my college the day of, enjoyed the free sandwiches, and then did things that weren't sitting in Con Hall for hours in the summer. Lots of ways to celebrate outside of the ceremony - go out for a nice dinner with your friends from different colleges or something like that might be a lot more fun imo.",comment,3

I feel like there must be a way to rent — so many people specifically plan graduation photo shoots. I just have to figure out how lol.",comment,0
