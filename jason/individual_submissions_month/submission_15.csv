Harrington Housing is a scam and I was left homeless on move in date,Physical_Database_16,1m0at17,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m0at17/harrington_housing_is_a_scam_and_i_was_left/,1752562244.0,"  
Just wanted to share a brutal recent housing experience in Toronto in case it saves someone from the same situation.

On July 1, I was supposed to move into a room I‚Äôd booked through **Harrington Housing**, a coliving provider that rents out rooms in apartments around the city. I‚Äôd been in contact with their sales agent **Sam** since **June 12**, who confirmed move-in for July 1, sent me the address, and told me to come by at a set time.

When I arrived with my bags, ready to move in?  
They had **no record of a room assignment for me.**  
I was effectively **homeless** with no notice and had to find a place to live for the entire month **on a few hours‚Äô notice**.

I‚Äôd already paid:

* **Last month‚Äôs rent**
* **$350 deposit**

As of now ‚Äî **two weeks later** ‚Äî they‚Äôve only refunded **$150** of that deposit. No full refund. No urgency. No compensation for the massive disruption they caused.

I have since discovered that this was not an accident - this is how Harrington does business. They are deliberate scamsters.  
‚úÖ Their company is structured to get your money (deposits, first and last months' rent) into their bank account to begin to make money off it (the float) while not providing the service you think you're going to get  
‚úÖ They have paralegals on staff who are regularly in housing court to keep your money (they've structured their contracts so that you have no rights under Ontario housing law)  
‚úÖ Their customer service is nonexistent because of this business model

This company operates by renting units in regular rental buildings and subletting them by the room to students and young professionals who can't afford a whole apartment. They are not professional landlords ‚Äî in fact, providing affordable accommodation is NOT their business model (although that sometimes happens). It's making money off interest from deposits.

This isn‚Äôt just about inconvenience. This is someone holding **your money** while failing to **provide basic housing** they promised in writing.

On July 1st I was left homeless with a few hours' notice to find somewhere else to live for the month.

Posting this to warn students, new arrivals, or anyone desperate for housing in this brutal rental market:  
üìõ **Avoid Harrington Housing**  
üìõ **Don‚Äôt trust a room booking until you have keys in hand**  
üìõ **Document everything**

If needed, I‚Äôve archived the full WhatsApp conversation with their agent Sam, who is a massively documented p.o.s.

This is not a rare horror story. After digging around, I‚Äôve found others with similar experiences. Their whole business model depends on students and internationals not knowing their rights.

You‚Äôve been warned.",submission,81

Is Harrington an official partner or in any way affiliated with UofT or other universities? Perhaps you can let the university know the malpractice that‚Äôs going on so they can officially say DO NOT USE HARRINGTON. also, you may be able to put pressure on Harrington by reaching out to reporters at CBC or CTV¬†

If none of this is an option, please DM me and we can work on writing an article for the Varsity to at least make the general uoft populace aware of what‚Äôs going on",comment,16

Try calling your bank in case you made the payments by card; when I did that, the bank said it would investigate, and Harrington apparently just never complied with them, so I got all my money back (thank god). 

I thought maybe I cocked it up somehow, but this is sounding like a scheme that's been going on.",comment,8
