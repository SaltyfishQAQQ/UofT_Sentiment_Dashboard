I’m starting at UofT this fall and wanted to ask: are there any hidden gems, study spots, cheap food places, or just cool corners around St. George campus that most first-years don’t know about?

Same with Emmanuel college library. Oldy and really beautiful

I’m a sucker for people watching at vic college quad.

Hart house is also nice too. They’ve just got chairs and tables laying around for some work/reading/chilling. I fell asleep there once and some kinda stranger put a red bull on the coffee table beside me (UofT community!!)

Little Italy and Chinatown for eats. I’d say Chinatown has the better cheap eats but little Italy has more aesthetic places.",comment,10

EJ Pratt and Gerstein have private desks you can study at. If you want to join a club or at least go to some events to make friends, even if you’re not in stem, the physics union is a fun place to go (the lounge is in the 2nd floor of McLennan)",comment,2
