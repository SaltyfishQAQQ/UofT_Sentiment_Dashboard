I think maybe my IB final grades didn’t meet the “maintain current academic standing” part of the conditional as I went from a 35 to a 30, but social science and life science have the same conditional offer requirements which are “Obtain the International Baccalaureate Diploma and maintain your current academic standing” so I’m kinda confused why. I don’t really know what should I do now, any advice or help would be appreciated.",submission,21

I am from the US though and they never gave me an opportunity to take calculus in high school, so I am taking a college Calculus 1 course right now. I was able to send proof of enrollment and my grade and get back into Life Sciences. I’m not sure if that could be it, but are you missing a prerequisite that’s needed for life sciences and not social?",comment,5

I had the same thing happen to me last year but with a different diploma (A-level) where I applied to life sciences, got accepted but got deferred to social sciences due to not meeting the conditional offer, I ended up accepting it and going anyway because I heard I can just switch to a life science program at the end of my first year, and that’s what happened I’m entering my second year now as a life science student, as long as you take the prerequisite courses for whichever program of study (PoSt) you want, you can get in, obviously some programs are more competitive than others, while others are open enrolment meaning that you get accepted as long as you pass the required courses. Obviously I don’t know how priority enrollment will go because I was in an FLC at the time which automatically enrolled me in the basic life science courses but I think it should be fine, first year courses usually have loads of seats and as long as u enroll immediately at the time of non priority enrollment you should be fine!",comment,2

I didn’t personally send them my transcript because it came from the program I did directly so I didn’t mail it or anything. I don’t think that would be the case for me because I did take a calculus equivalent course and I think I did just end up not maintaining my grades enough in the calc course I did. Could I ask how you got into contact with them because I definitely what to clarify and see if there is anything I can do right now? If not I’m already enrolled in life science prerequisite courses I want for next year so I’ll see if I can switch next year! Thanks so much for the insight again :),comment,1

For Art Sci, except the CS stream, all streams are just for course enrollment priority in first year. As a humanities student I had priority enrollment for humanities program courses. Except for that, there is nothing that the stream does for you. I took some life sci courses in first year, and simply applied for a life sci program for my program of study (post). Now I’m graduating with HBSc. As long as you took the prerequisite courses, you can apply for any program you want (except CS specialist; that’s reserved for CS stream students).",comment,2
