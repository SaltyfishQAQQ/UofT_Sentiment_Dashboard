Is this a legit email or am I being prankeddddd??,Forward-Might-5798,1m4sk46,https://i.redd.it/xxqlncedy1ef1.jpeg,1753027359.0,I got this email and Iâ€™m lowkey interested in it but itâ€™s signed differently from the email itâ€™s sent from. I held down the links and theyâ€™re from the actual uoft sites. But like also how would they know I took that course and they also used my middle name which isnâ€™t used anywhere other than acorn. ,submission,67

I think this might be legit. Some programs send emails to high-achieving students during POSt application season to improve their applicant pools, especially for their specialist programs. I was recruited to MGY specialist via email. 

If you're interested in GGR, definitely apply for it on ACORN!",comment,78

On the department's webpage, Cynthia Lim (the sender) is listed the Undergraduate Assistant and Paul Hess (the signee) is listed the Associate Chair, Undergraduate. So if you did indeed take GGR124 and did indeed get a high grade, then this is legitimate. This is a pretty typical email for departments to send out.

Note that this doesn't really have the hallmarks of a scam: it's not asking you to send them any information (ID#, password, etc.) or go to any sketchy sites. The only reason to be worried would be if you never took that course or if you got a low grade!",comment,28
