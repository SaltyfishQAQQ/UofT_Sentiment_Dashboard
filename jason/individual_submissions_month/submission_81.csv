Just check archive exam dates from past years, and book after the lastest from those. If you realize can go back sooner after official final schedule release, and you also want to go back sooner, then pay small fee to change ticket date. It is not ideal to do this since you might need to pay more fee, but it may cheaper than paying when you book it late(especially the Christmas time lol).",comment,2

So it’s a whole ordeal unfortunately. I personally think they should just book too many rooms and then reduce if needed yk?",comment,9
