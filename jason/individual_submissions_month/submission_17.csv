I couldnt take ANY of the seminar courses I had lined up (they were all full from humanities and soc sci kids that were able to enrol at earlier times)-- why did they set me up with a late asf time (11:45) also i gotta take the god forsaken sprint across campus from bio120 (in CH) to chm135 (in OI) üíîüíîif anyone has any tips on learning how to teleport that would help too.

Anything that's in CH you can leave whenever and no one will care. Plus both BIO120 and CHM135 are pretty big lectures. Also, bio120 always has all it's lectures recorded and uploaded to quercus. CHM135 does the same, but at least for us they deleted the recordings every too weeks.

Also, with classes this big you can go to any lecture section, even if it isn't yours. No one cares and the evening sections are usually mostly empty after like the first month. You'll be fine, don't stress it.",comment,2

My notes are hard to read cuz of that lol. If it‚Äôs the same prof as two years ago, you can expect the lecture to rarely go past 12:30 which was nice. 

I don‚Äôt actually have a lot of course material left, there were biweekly quizzes that were online, and I think the midterm might have been online as well. 

There was a program that we had to use as a discussion board every week, which you did have to pay for, and these posts were worth a decent portion of the grade. They were not hard to do, just had to review the week‚Äôs course material/google stuff. So just keep on top of those (if they still do them). They‚Äôre actually kinda fun if you put effort into them and they force you to study. I unfortunately do not have past tests, just know that they were mostly memorization based, so you had to know and understand certain processes/terms. 

If they still do that group project, please be a good team member and actually READ THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE ASSIGNMENT (sorry, still mad about it). Also make sure that everyone in the group gets to see the final product before submission so that you can catch any errors/parts that don‚Äôt follow the rubric. That project is worth a lot and to mess it up puts you in a bad spot on the final (had to get a 96 on a multiple choice test with 50 questions to keep an 85, which I did, which also shows it‚Äôs really not that hard of a course). 

For the final, if the prof decides to release a review video again, watch it. Basically everything mentioned in it came up on the final. I still reviewed other stuff too just in case.",comment,1
