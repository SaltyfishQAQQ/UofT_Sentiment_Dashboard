Is there anyways for me to get back the money after Iâ€™ve sent it or is it done once itâ€™s done ðŸ˜­ ,submission,16

When you pay it will go into your balance.  And probably the award goes into your balance. I think you can refund it after the award is given. I don't think it is problematic but also send them an email,comment,7
