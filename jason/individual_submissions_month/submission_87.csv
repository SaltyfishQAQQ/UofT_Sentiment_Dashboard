Struggling with MAT135/136/137/157/223/224/240 (or any other math course)?

Just started undergrad and finding U of T math courses a bit overwhelming? Whether you're wrestling with calculus, linear algebra, or proofs, the Mathematics Support Initiative (MSI) is here to help â€” and itâ€™s completely free.



MSI is a student-run, volunteer-based peer support group created by U of T students for U of T students. We regularly host Math Help Sessions throughout the term, especially during midterm and final seasons. These sessions focus on clearing up confusing concepts, catching up on material, and giving you a space to ask questions â€” no judgment, no pressure.



Last year, we helped hundreds of students through our organized review events, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.



Our tutors are not only strong academically â€” including a U of T Physics PhD student and a Math Spec student as our director â€” but they also know how to explain tough concepts in a clear and friendly way. Our goal is to help you truly understand the material, not just memorize it.



We're not here to sell notes or charge fees â€” just to reduce your stress and boost your confidence in math.



If youâ€™re looking for help, you can find us (and contact info) @ [https://sop.utoronto.ca/group/mathematics-support-initiative-msi/](https://sop.utoronto.ca/group/mathematics-support-initiative-msi/)",submission,12
