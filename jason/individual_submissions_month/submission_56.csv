"Incoming second year, rant about first year and need some advice for second :(",Utagawashii,1lzgdcl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1lzgdcl/incoming_second_year_rant_about_first_year_and/,1752479191.0,"My first year of CS didn’t go well — academically or socially. I finished fall and winter with 3.5 credits and a GPA I’m not proud of. I ended up isolating myself socially because hanging out with friends started to feel like a waste of time; I was overwhelmed and couldn’t focus around others. My life basically became: eat, sleep, problem sets, repeat.

Some turmoil separated my friend group, so I spent semester 2 mostly alone and scrambling to find groupmates for projects. Overall, it was a mess — but I’m glad I made it through. I’m currently taking 1.0 summer credit, so I’ll meet the 4.0 credit requirement to declare my program.

That said, since I only had 3.5 credits during fall/winter, I won’t have priority enrollment for second-year CS courses. On top of that, I’m on OSAP probation because I dropped to part-time this summer after applying for full-time funding. (I passed a course I thought I might fail, then dropped the extra one I applied for ""just in case"" — not realizing the consequences.)

First year wasn’t *impossibly* hard. It just took a long time to adjust. By the end, things started to feel more manageable — probably because I was studying alone a lot more. Still, it was unhealthy, and I’m hoping to find more balance in second year.

During exams, I considered a gap year, but people around me said that was just the stress talking. After more thought, I feel like a part-time course load would be a better compromise — but I’m nervous. Being on OSAP probation means I won’t be able to drop to part-time mid-year if full-time becomes too much. I’m okay with taking longer to graduate, but part of me wonders if I’m just taking the easy way out. I’m also scared that even with a lighter course load, I won’t ""fix"" myself.

I feel lost right now. I don’t even know what courses to take since I likely won’t get into most CS classes due to enrollment priority. Should I go part-time next year or try powering through full-time? Any study strategies I can experiment with during the summer to prep for second year? I’ve tried the usual (office hours, MLC), but I’d love to hear realistic, repeatable habits, or mindset shifts that worked for those who have been in my situation.

Thanks for reading",submission,21

Use the following link to see if there was a problem with space in previous years but as far as I remember, none of my second year cs classes were completely full.

I had a terrible first year too (financially and mentally) and honestly it was just a big shift to enjoying the process no matter how hard it gets. Get into the habit of sitting there and recognising patterns until things start to click for proof-based courses (CSC236 and CSC263), I did fail the first test for both courses just learning how to study but once you build that habit its all uphill from there :)

lastly, do not isolate yourself, i think its the worst thing you can do with how stressful cs is. Take breaks, go out and socialize, join clubs etc etc.

A friend of mine did this and she was generally pretty chill and able to join clubs and socialize, said she learned more because she only had to focus on a few classes at a time, had a part-time job that led to a full-time career. I wished I’d done the same.",comment,2

* I would consider taking a semester/year off if you can afford it, don't just stay home all day but it can give some time away from weekly deadlines. If everyday you wake up like it's a battlefield it might be burnout (I'm no health professional so seek professional help if you can), that analogy reflected my undergrad when I kept taking summer courses over the years mostly to cover failed courses and no break in between. I didn't suddenly get A's after the break but having distance helps

* with regards to the friend group situation I got no specific advice but be mindful if you still continue to take courses without giving yourself a long break, seeing your colleagues and comparing yourself to them is a guarantee and you might mentally snap on a really bad day which is never a good thing to happen. Every undergrad is going to have their crashout moment, how you respond and pick yourself back up will be key here

* the only best study strategy that worked for me is to work with others (do not cheat) and help them understand concepts as well, treat them with a coffee or two. I assume you will be looking for internships so you might as well start building those connections now",comment,2

Focus on the courses you can enrol in, and if possible, do not put so much pressure on yourself about CS.  Do not isolate; it will exacerbate all the negative stuff.  The faculty offers recognized study groups... that might be worth looking into.  https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/recognized-study-groups/.  Student life also offers workshops on learning how to learn.  https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/program/learning-how-to-learn/.  You've got this.",comment,1
