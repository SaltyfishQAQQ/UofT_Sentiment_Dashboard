Our daughter (4th year in Sep) registered but hasn’t attended any classes in the past 2 years,Careless_Possible_64,1manqg0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1manqg0/our_daughter_4th_year_in_sep_registered_but_hasnt/,1753626639.0,"We just found out two days ago that our daughter hasn’t attended any of her university classes for the past two years. She registered for courses every term but didn’t go to lectures or write any exams.

She has always been a good student, so we trusted her and never worried about her academics. She did very well in her first year, but during her second year, she began struggling with depression (When she moved out of the dorm and lived on her own). Things gradually got out of control, and she lost control of her studies. Out of fear and guilt, she kept everything hidden from us until now, when she could no longer manage it alone.

We want to support her the right way, but we don’t know what steps to take. She’s in St. George campus, going into what should have been her fourth year.

Is academic suspension likely in this case?

Is it possible for her to take a break and return later?

Is there a path to recovery and continuation with the university’s support?

Who should we contact at U of T to start addressing this?

As parents, we feel terrible for not realizing what was happening and not being there to support her sooner. We are arranging for a psychological assessment and doing everything we can to help her recover and rebuild her confidence.

Any advice or shared experience would be deeply appreciated. Thank you.",submission,270

She'll be informed of conditions of probation/suspension. You won't be - she's an adult, so you aren't part of the conversation with the university. She can check her university email and her status in Acorn. 

There are always options to return for students who take time off and weren't actually expelled for misconduct. I recommend doing this - or whatever alternative path makes sense - after she's sought help for whatever issues have been holding her back. Use nonuniversity services while she's not enrolled. If she returns, it may then be with documentation to takr to accessibility services and even, perhaps, with documentation that might help her retroactively withdraw from previous courses with the aid of her registrar. But she, not you, needs to do this. 

As a parent who's been in a similar position, please be gentle and kind. Help her get help. But step back from contacting institutions on her behalf - they don't deal with parents of adults. Bookmark relevant info on her registrar's site and in the academic calendar for later, so you know where it is if she's looking for support with that. 

But also be prepared that going back might not be the path she decides on. That's okay. And note that she'll need to start repaying loans - we helped our kid with that at first till they had some income.",comment,73

I’m 33 years old, and my situation might be slightly different because I am a gay male and I grew up in a world where it feels like society values are a century apart, but I still heavily relate to this. 

Once your daughter had freedom to live on her own, it gave her a chance to see her independency. Most of us go through depression because we realize that there was an image of us that was built by everyone around us, and no longer being in that space takes us out of a comfort zone, and into an unknown world. We can have all the support from the people we came from, but living alone causes people to see many things. Is the program she was in something she really wanted? Did she want to explore more than the life given to her? Has she experimented with drugs and was too scared to tell you about her experience? Did she suddenly take interest in something else, but feels ashamed of saying anything since she wants to live up to an expectation? In all, has she found who she wants to be in a world where she is truly alone? 

I always wanted to live up to my parents’ expectation, especially when it came to school and trying to navigate my own life. I ended up becoming a PSW and later went to nursing school just to prove to them that I can do something they somewhat approved of, and seeing that I failed to become a doctor that they wanted me to be, at least nursing school gave them a reason to stop expecting me to be someone I couldn’t. And keep in mind that I went to college for nursing, not university. So in a way, I still felt like I failed them, even after graduating from college. Years later, I moved out on my own and began writing. I found myself and pulled out of my depression, realizing that I had a voice that just wanted to release itself all along.

I’m an author of 3 books now, and just before starting my English and Philosophy undergraduate degree at the age of 32 at UofT downtown, I published 2 of them. I’ve built a little paradise called home, and my relationship with my family is immaculate. I also found my love for raving, and I couldn’t be more happier. I still work at the hospital and I do have stable income, but I always identify as being a writer before saying that I am a nurse. My passion for reading, writing, and raving came at the perfect time indeed, but it all started when I moved out on my own and found my independence. 

There are many things at play, and there are many complexities to deal with. Maybe a start for your situation could be to ask yourself these questions:
- Is this something my daughter really wanted, or is it something she was guided into wanting before building herself into her own identity?
- Even though I trust my daughter, does she let fear hold her back from trusting me the same way I trust her?
- Does she have a passion for something that is thought to not bring her a happy life?
- Is school something she really needs at the moment?

I hope this helps in any sort of way. I feel like a psychological assessment is definitely an option if you choose to go that route, but sometimes (and more surprisingly), having a mango smoothie on a nice sunny day with someone to talk to (or to be completely silent with) is all that we need to begin enjoying life 😊",comment,29

Like your daughter I also was a great student until my third year (covid hit, so did mental health problems) and I failed practically every single class I had for the next two years. Since I had a good GPA from my first two years I never actually hit academic probation with my school despite actively flunking all my classes (I went to Queen’s so it might be different with UofT— I was placed on academic probation for OSAP and wasn’t able to continue with loans). I had to take a few extra years, and finally just graduated this spring in my 7th year of a 4 year degree. I wasn’t able get very serious about changing and actively trying to get better until this year, so if your daughter has the right supports chances are she’ll be able to graduate earlier than that. 
If I could go back and do things differently, if I had the help and support of my parents I would take a few years off. She should be able to make an appeal to take time off school, and then she can return when she’s ready. She can also make an appeal to late drop her classes,  citing her struggles with her mental health to salvage her GPA. She should speak with her academic advisors and student wellness services to see what specific aides the university has to offer its students. Good luck, I hope your daughter finds the path that is right for her.",comment,12

As for her degree, she has completed one year. 

Can she live at home and commute to one of the other campuses? They are smaller and suburban which may reduce anxiety.

I have taken may 2020- august 2021, as well as the fall 2024 semester off. Both times, as a domestic student, I just needed to not enroll into courses. When I took more than 12 months off I sent a form notifying to activate my account for the next course enrollment period I took part in. If she is an international student this will most likely be a different process.

If she has any scholarships/awards/financial aid, they may have conditions on her taking time off you should be aware of.

Since you are talking about getting her psychological help, then the diagnosing dr may be able to provide relevant documentation in appealing/petitioning any suspension/probabtion. Whether she is even put on a suspension or probation will probably depend on her GPA and other factors.

In terms of support, it sounds like any additional help she needs could be worked out with accessibility services down the line in this process. But first, the registrar will have all of the answers you need about your next steps.",comment,12

They can definitely discuss and create short-term and long-term goals. They have some amazing therapy resources and counsellors as well.  But I'm curious- if she hasn't been attending classes or writing her exams- she would still receive a GPA on Acorn? Maybe check Acorn (Grades section) to see what is written? Has she received any emails that she hasn't told you yet about academic suspension? 

I understand she is an adult but I think moving forward you should ask her when she has a midterm or quiz etc.  View her marks at the end of the semester. Always check academic dates. I was struggling with depression (I didn't tell them but they saw signs) since first year but my parents to this day have a copy of my timetable to make sure I'm attending class. They know all my midterm and finals dates and receive screenshots of my midterm and other assignment marks on quercus and they check my final semester grades. I know a lot of people are against this practice (doesn't foster independence or lowers self-esteem blah blah blah) but I'm glad they checked and disciplined me despite them knowing I have depression because I don't know what would have happened otherwise.",comment,16

I haven’t seen any official notice of suspension or probation, but her cumulative GPA has fallen below 1.46 after two years.

I’ll be asking her to join the conversation with her academic advisor on Monday so we can hear their advice together. Hopefully, they’ll help us understand what options are available moving forward.

I say that because if you get below a certain average, they’ll talk to you and you may even have you suspended.

From what I know, you can take short breaks from university for mental health reasons, but please contact her registrar and explain the whole situation. Here’s my personal opinion, I don’t think U of T is right for her. Not because she’s not smart enough, but this establishment can really break someone if they don’t have the right supports. You can also be a good student in HS, and completely get beaten up by the standards here (happened to me). I was in a similar situation in my second year (graduated now) and I reached out for help right away, I think things would have ended worse had I not. I would have a long chat with her and see what she wants. Was her depression caused by a disinterest in her program? You know, just not feeling like the path she was on made sense?

I would take the next few weeks while she’s getting help to try and help her figure out what she wants out of university. I had a friend who dropped out, took a year to work and figure out what he wanted, and then he went back. Staying would have absolutely broken him.

A friend of mine was able to do this for some classes she failed (for similar reasons to your daughter), though it did require a uoft Verification of Illness (VOI) and other documentation from her psychiatrist explaining that her untreated medical condition was related to why she failed the courses. I'm not positive how common this is, the degree of documentation required, or if it would be applicable in your daughter's case, but it's something she could look into in the future if she's concerned about the failed courses impacting her ability to get into grad school.



Also, just as some encouragement, I was in a similar boat in my third year of university. I struggled a lot with my mental health and attendance (didn't attend classes, only did some assignments, etc), which led to me dropping all of my classes that year. I decided to continue as a part-time student & it took a lot of the pressure off, which gave me more time to work on my mental health & eventually get to a place where I am able to balance school/work/life in a healthier way. I went from skipping literally all of my lectures & not doing well in classes to consistent 80s/90s after making the switch. 



I'm not positive if she would currently have access to Health & Wellness if she is suspended, but if she does, they offer same day counseling appointments, psychiatrist appointments, and they have a lot of information & resources related to uoft and community mental health supports (sliding scale therapy, crisis centres, addiction support etc). There can be long wait times to initially connect with a psychiatrist unfortunately. 



I'm glad to see you're here to support her! I was honestly quite afraid of disappointing my dad when I was doing poorly, not because I thought he'd be angry, but just out of shame and guilt. I felt so much relief being honest with him & his non-judgmental support really meant a lot to me (and it's one of the reasons I was able to get back on track). I obviously don't know your daughter, but I imagine that your support will go a long way with her as well.",comment,2

For most other students, their parents would not be so reasonable upon discovering their child wasn't attending class and taking exams. The fact that you guys are acknowledging your daughter's mental health struggles and still continuing to support her shows how lucky your daughter is to have parents like you.

Now, to keep it straight, unfortunately, because she hasn't been taking exams she most probably will be put on academic probation and may not be allowed to enroll in courses for a while. I would recommend taking that time to address her struggles and seek therapy. In my opinion, post-secondary education is the most stressful part of a person's life. I say this because it took 6 years for myself to complete my degree and it ended up being in something completely different than what I came in for.

The point is, your daughter needs time to heal. She needs to step away from that stress and breathe and have someone to talk to. You need to be there for her now more than ever. Talking to an academic advisor should help to understand next steps but your priority should be your daughter's health.

It’s incredibly treatment resistant, and I do A LOT of things to keep it under control. I managed to get my undergrad and masters this way, took 10 years off, and now I’m going back as a PhD student.

Your daughter definitely needs help with her depression- I’m not doubting that in the least. But she may also need a lot of help taking responsibility for her own life. And as long as you’re bailing her out with minimal consequences for her… I don’t know if that’s going to happen.

Here’s the trap that I see so many parents of peers with depression get into: their parents manage everything out of a sense of guilt for not knowing about the depression earlier. And they help their kid get back on their feet… but with a lot of support! Sometimes it’s cleaning their apartment, or making them healthy meals to keep in the freezer, or taking on some housework while they’re in school. That’s great… but you want them to be able to stand on their own two feet afterwards.

I was in the exact same position as one of my friends in high school. I took a year off after high school, worked three jobs, and when I got to university, I was determined to make it work, even with the depression and some significant trauma issues.

15 years go by and she gets back in touch: I’m living with my parents (as a caregiver), have responsibilities, a steady, decently paying job, no kids (because I was careful to make sure that didn’t happen), a dog…. And while she had gone on to college after high school, she dropped out after a semester. She had several children (none of them planned) and was in a homeless shelter because she couldn’t wait any longer for government funding to come through for subsidized rent when she split with the father of her children. She had no job, no money, no real sense of mental health. She dated men and would completely lose herself in the relationships until suddenly they would be “total assholes” and end things with them. Even with funding, she refused to go back to school. She took no responsibility for any of it. Everything was someone else’s fault.

I suspect you want your daughter to end up a bit more like me than my friend.

My masters program was hell. Like, really, really awful. I had to take responsibility for that. My parents were in a different country, and expect for some financial assistance, they were there for me, but not in terms of doing things for me. If I didn’t take my dog out for a walk, that meant my dog didn’t get walked. If I didn’t study for a test, that meant that I got a shitty mark on it.

Please give your daughter progressively more responsibility and have ongoing conversations with her about what she’s doing and what she’s working towards. Make sure she has a plan, and is actively working towards it!

Giving her all the chances in the world will not help unless she is doing the work.",comment,2

For now, we're taking a step back to give her the time and space she needs to decide her next steps. The advisor told us that situations like this are not uncommon: while some students adjust well to U of T, others may find it more challenging, especially if they’re reluctant to ask for help. She has always been a strong student with high expectations of herself, and sadly, we didn’t see the signs earlier because we never had concerns about her academically before.

I’ll wrap up this thread by thanking everyone for your input, and my daughter has been reading all the comments. We hope that by sharing our experience, it may help raise awareness for other students or parents in similar situations. Please don’t hesitate to seek help when things get difficult; support is always available from your family or school, and it is much easier than you think after talking to academic advisors.",comment,1

I used to work in the areas of misconduct at TMU and have taught at U of T. My instinct is she needs help to treat her affliction. What I can say is that your daughter will have access to counselling services—highly qualified psychologists and psychotherapists etc. Most importantly, she needs you and some mentorship. There might be particular challenges around learning that psychology will not be able to pinpoint. Let me know if you’d like to chat offline. There are programs that I’ve designed for students on probation—non-punitive — that can support her, if she chooses to reenroll. Mainly, she likely needs you. Tough situation—as a parent and teacher, I empathize. That said, we used to have parents as “support” in misconduct meetings; however, they couldn’t speak much in those meetings. Moreover, there are restorative measures to help students reintegrate into the community after major policy breaches (academic or nonacademic) and good universities tend to adopt a pedagogical approach. Even if there is a suspension (I’m not convinced), there are mechanisms to appeal those. You could speak to the student union or put the policy through ChatGPT to grasp her options—if this is the case! We had students who faked an entire degree via impersonation—they were expelled. That’s the only case of expulsion I experienced in two years in that hellish office!",comment,1

I experienced depressive symptoms in my first year at U of T St. George Campus also.  I didn’t tell my parents either.

The school will probably ask for a doctor’s note to indicate that your daughter was absent from school due to mental health issues.  With the doctor’s note (e.g. family doctor, psychiatrist, or psychologist) your daughter can probably return to school later.

It’s great that you are helping your daughter with communicating with the school and her recovery ❤️‍🩹.  With your support and treatment, she will be ok 👌🏼.  Good luck 🤞🏻.",comment,1

Maybe you can help her connect with her college to see if there’s anything else she should be doing in her case? You should be able to call or email them. If you email, they might get back in a few business days so calling is better if you want answers right away. 

In the mean time, I would try to get her registered with accessibility services as well so she has accommodations in place for when she returns to school. You can find out more through here, although if she’s taking some time off school you don’t need to rush into registration: https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/accessibility-services-registration-and-documentation-requirements/

I’m so sorry for what she’s been through and I’m really proud of her for pushing through and reaching out for support. It’s super hard to do, I know, and yet she’s already making great progress. You’re also doing a great job as a parent. Please keep supporting her and showing compassion- it’s going to mean the world to her. I’ve been there with UofT and the mental health struggles.

Maybe I am overreacting, but please allow me to elaborate a little. I have read through all the comments here so far from everyone, and your responses.

Please please please make sure that she is saying that she “very much wants to continue her studies” because she genuinely wants to, and not because she feels the expectation from the parents/society to do so. From what I am reading, the expectation from the parents is likely how she ended up here in the first place.

The way you find out what she genuinely wants is to NOT ask her that question again, not anytime soon. She has already lied to you for two years about school, she is not only feeling the pressure to do so, but also just used to it by now. She is not doing it intentionally, but she will continue to do so, if you keep “checking in” with her about whether she wants to go back to school. Just stop asking.

If you are truly trying to support her, you need to be supporting her mental health first and foremost, and no be worried about her academics or whether or not she will be able to return to school. None of that matters right now. Your attitude should be “f*ck school, live your life, kid, and we support whatever you want to do right now.” And not booking a meeting with an academic advisor that now she has to talk to. She probably absolutely does not want to be dealing with this right now, but now she has to because you have set it up. Do you see the pattern?

The wording of “back on track” is something that a psychotherapist would NEVER use, because it blatantly implies she is currently off track, she is not where she is supposed to be. On the contrary, she is exactly where she is supposed to be due to her previous life experience, and it’s OKAY to be where she is. Stop making her think that where she is now is WRONG. Based on your wording, you are still thinking that, so you need to stop that thought first.

Also regarding your comment somewhere that said something along the line of “the expectation of taking the initiative to reach out for help” is a common one in out society, but it doesn’t make sense to modern pedagogy.  They need to be taught, be allowed, be given permission to reach out for help, from a young age. Basic human survival instincts is fight or flight, doesn’t include “reaching out for help.”It is not an expectation, it is a life skill; and just like other skills, we need to be taught that from a young age; or rather, at least be allowed to do so, and made feeling safe to do so. I sense that there is a misconception there.

She currently needs space. Please make sure you leave her lots of space, and make sure she knows that it is OKAY to have the space, and it is OKAY to want the space, and it is OKAY to be where she is. Simply telling her that works.

She doesn’t need to “get back on track”, she is still on track because she never left her track. She left the track that you, as parents, set up for her. Let her be on her track, and if you want to support her, tell her it’s okay to be on her own track.",comment,15

However, since there is mental health involved.. once she does get diagnosed she needs to declare the “disability” to OSAP and uoft. She should be able to late withdraw for this year.. I’m not sure about the first year. — I went through a very similar situation in my second year.. I just stopped going and ended up failing my 2nd year. Thankfully my academic advisor supported me. She was also stern in telling me: never bottle this up again. Never be afraid to ask for help. Those words stuck with me for life. 

U of T is a beautiful institution for the brightest of minds. That doesn’t mean that some of those minds have some baggage we gotta work on. UofT will support you through that. Also when I did go back after my crash out, I took it slow! If you’re a student with a disability you can take a part time course load but be considered fulltime for funding purposes. That’s probably the best way to go once/if she decides to go back. Slow and steady wins the race.. but my last year I had built so much confidence back up I did 7 courses in one semester and 6 in the other and got all A’s : ) — she’s gotta find her own way though parents… you guys are really sweet though keep supporting here ❤️ 

TLDR: since it’s 2 years, she is most likely currently suspended but, she can try too retroactively late withdraw from last years courses (2024-2025 year). That should erase the damage in her GPA and take her back into academic good standing. To do this declare ur mental health (disability) to OSAP and uoft.",comment,5

Editing to add…

As per U of T’s Academic Records, Guidelines Concerning Access to Official Student Academic Records policy:

“Access by others

1.  The public conferral of degrees, diplomas and certificates is a core activity of the University and the information included on the degree, diploma or certificate is personal information that is available to the general public.
 
2. All other information contained in the official student academic record, shall be released to other persons and agencies only with the student's prior express written consent, or on the presentation of a court order.”

I'm not sure why you find it so problematic that the university does what can to protect its students. I've been a professor for a long time and been through a lot of these situations and again we have these protections in place for a reason. I'm sorry you find them so problematic. These are not children, these are adults , and we need documentation to have private information shared with other adults. Would you want your doctor as an adult to share all your private medical information with your parent? Students can be bullied and coerced into including their parents when they don't necessarily agree to have them there, these protections are in place for those students. It's great not everyone needs them and has trustworthy parents but that's not always the case.",comment,3

Under any circumstances? Please tell me more about this policy.",comment,1

Every time a parent has shown up with their child, I’ve refused the meeting and referred it to staff. Students tell me things are “fine” by them all the time. I’m not about to risk my job for that.",comment,3

I’m talking about what happens at the registrar’s level.,comment,1

It gets very tricky fast. I’ve been in these meetings where the parent is a “guest” of the student but is driving the conversation.,comment,2

That’s the claim I’m challenging.,comment,1

And if they feel the parent is driving the conversation they may choose to end the conversation/meeting and reengage with just the student.,comment,1
