Personally canâ€™t recommend anything because i didnt like my order when I went, but that was on me. Espresso tonics are an acquired taste.

Caffiends (vic college) is cheap and acts as a good study space if you go during off-hours. Their drip coffee is inedible but they have a great tea selection and their matcha wasnâ€™t bad. They have seasonal drinks as well.Â 

I had my favourite mocha ever at Lâ€™Espresso Bar Mercurio but itâ€™s expensive there. Great espresso quality.

I personally did not like Aroma Espresso Bar (near bay station). The iced latte i got had grounds floating in it and the coffee just wasnâ€™t good. Donâ€™t care for Second Cup either, itâ€™s overpriced and the quality of the espresso drinks is bad.Â 

I didnâ€™t love 18feet at the Leslie L Dan pharmacy building. I got a mocha that was just ok, but they have a lot of other types of drinks that could be good like teas, matcha, and trendy specialty drinks.

Some others close enough to UofT that may be worth going to, but I havenâ€™t tried yet: Neo coffee bar, toroast",comment,10

They have a good selection on drinks and seems to have good pastries as well (havenâ€™t tried them yet but they look good). They also support local artists and have them displayed on the walls and shelvesðŸ¥¹ if you have classes around MedSci, Bahen, or Leslie Dan pharm, itâ€™s quite a short walk. 

2) 18 feet cafe (Leslie Dan Pharm building): this is also decent place but their drinks can be a bit pricey at times

3) Neo Coffee Bar on Gloucester St: if youâ€™re on the other side of campus around St Mikes and Kelly Library, this is about a 10 min walk from there. I loved their Cold brew and prices were okay.

4) This oneâ€™s not a cafe, but Chatime on Bloor St (close to St George TTC subway station): if Iâ€™m not feeling coffee, I like getting their teas instead. I always get a mango green tea with coconut jelly. And if youâ€™re looking for a cheap lunch, thereâ€™s also a Galleria supermarket 2 doors down :))

Iâ€™m a big matcha person so I mainly went there to try out their matcha lattes and Iâ€™ve liked it from all three places! But Iâ€™ve also tried different drinks from 1) and 3) too.",comment,4
