GHOST story from the Great Hall in the Hart House Building UofT,didiwa99,1mcx2cc,https://i.redd.it/mfspcp9buxff1.jpeg,1753849263.0,"Today I visited the Great Hall at the Hart House building at UofT. I love exploring so when I saw this spiral staircase in the corner of the hall, I wanted to go up. I suspected that there was someone up there because I saw two water bottles on the floor in front of the staircase (you can see it in the image), but it was too quiet and I thought why would anyone sit up there. The more steps I took up, the darker it got. It was tight and somewhat scary but also interesting. After a few steps I saw a drawing on the wall, of a demon smiling, it was in red. I ignored it and kept walking out. Suddenly I asked ""is there anyone up there"" for no reason, and I didn't expect to get an answer back. I then heard a ""hello"" in a smooth, calm, and a playful voice. It didn't sound like a normal human voice, it almost sounded like the demon himself. So I freaked out and started yelling ""omg omg omg"" as I run down the staircase and out of the hall. No one followed. I was laughing so hard tbh. I thought someone must've been trying to prank us. I went back into the hall to take some pictures and still, there was no sound or no one coming out of there. I was there with someone, they were telling me that I was probably imagining all of that, but they were also recording a video while I was going up there and you can somewhat hear the voice before I began to yell so you know it was def real. It was mostly funny, I don't even think there was a ghost or anything I'm just saying to make it more interesting, but then I was almost so sure there was no one up there. What do we know about ghost stories at UofT? ",submission,62

There are a few different tour groups, but this is the one I see on campus most frequently: [https://hauntedwalk.com/experience/campus-secrets-and-spectres-university-of-toronto-ghost-tour/](https://hauntedwalk.com/experience/campus-secrets-and-spectres-university-of-toronto-ghost-tour/) 

(See also e.g.: [https://muddyyorktours.com/?page\_id=44](https://muddyyorktours.com/?page_id=44) which UofT News once recommended)

Disclaimer that I haven't been on one of their tours in a very long time, so I can't endorse them one way or another. But it is popular enough to run pretty regularly!",comment,4

I feel like it's just some messy people trying to make others believe that there are ghosts at uoft for fun or something. I forgot to mention, earlier that day, me and the person I was with were standing in the quad at the Hart House and someone made a random sound from above, probably trying to scare us on, but we already saw him so we knew it was just a guy trying to mess with us.",comment,1

Btw the video was a general recording of the hall and not me going up the staircase specifically, but you can still hear me in the background. If you listen carefully, you'll hear a voice right before I begin yelling and probably you won't be able to tell what was said because of how quiet it was and far away from the camera, but at least it's proof that I didn't hear the voice in my head only lol.",comment,1
