Out of every 4 people one of them sucks and the rest are alright. Usually at least 1-2 people in a large project are overqualified for most entry level positions imo if they cared about it as much as their grades.Â ,comment,10

When I was in a team of 3, I would've hired one of them cause they had front end skills I did not have and good work ethic. When I was in a team of four, two of them were pretty decent. The other one I barely even remember, so basically non-existent. But you have to keep in mind that's because I started in 2015. 

The issue with the market isn't people being qualified, because you're right that most people could at least *hold down* a job, even if they were subpar at it. The problem is you have to be exceptionally qualified in order to even be noticed, *then* you have to compete in interviews with other equally overqualified people. Too many people, too few jobs.",comment,2
