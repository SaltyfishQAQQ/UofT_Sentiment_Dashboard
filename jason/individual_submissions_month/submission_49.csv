I know it probably doesnâ€™t feel like it right now, but please remember that youâ€™re not alone. Many students have gone through something like this, and sadly, others in the future might too. It doesnâ€™t define your worth or your future. University can be incredibly overwhelming, especially when you're dealing with depression, stress, and the pressure to succeed.

Let me share a few things that helped me, and maybe they can help you too:

1. Reflect and Reassess

If you can, sit down and reflect or even write down what exactly went wrong last year. Ask yourself:

\- What triggered the depression or stress?

\- How exactly did this affect your academics? (e.g., burnout, lack of motivation, falling behind?)

\- Were you simply exhausted, emotionally numb, or just unable to focus?

\- Was the program itself too challenging, or were external factors the main issue?

\- Do you still truly want to pursue CS? (Iâ€™m not saying you should doubt yourself, but at this point in university, itâ€™s common to feel uncertain or even ask existential questions like this. It's worth considering what you really want.)

\- Whatâ€™s your backup plan? Even if CS is your top choice, always have a backup. I didnâ€™t have one in my first year, and when I didnâ€™t get into my program, I felt completely lost.

This kind of reflection can feel overwhelming, but it helped me regain a sense of control. Just writing it out gave me more clarity about what I needed to do next.

2. You Already Have a Plan and Thatâ€™s a Good Sign

You mentioned youâ€™re planning to take CSC148 and CSC165 to try again out-of-stream. Thatâ€™s actually a really good step. Even if youâ€™re feeling hopeless right now, the fact that youâ€™ve thought of a next step means you're still trying and thatâ€™s something to be proud of. If you do go ahead with this, try to make adjustments in how you approach things this time around, that is, your study methods, time management, mental health care, and support systems. That way, it wonâ€™t just be a repeat of last year.",comment,7

Be it therapy, a long meditation retreat, some time off taking college classes, or just spending a year doing physical labour until you're willing to do anything to not have to do that anymore. If you're having trouble with introductory classes then 2nd year classes will break you. Until you're able to fully dedicate yourself to the task and avoid getting sidetracked by your mental state, you're not likely to just turn it around.

Take the time to figure out specifically what it is about this program is causing you so much trouble. The first thing to ask yourself is why do you want to be in this program. Are you doing it out of passion and curiosity, or did it just sound like an easy way to earn money? Figure out what went wrong beyond just depression and stress. Are you missing some prerequisite knowledge? Do you find yourself turning to escapism entertainment when you should be working? Is there some sort of trauma that you need to work through? Essentially, can you figure out how to get your depression and stress under control, because if you can't then you might end up in a similar or worse situation.",comment,2

I just want to reach out across the noise and say: youâ€™re not alone.

What youâ€™re going through right now â€” the heavy mix of disappointment, confusion, hopelessness â€” itâ€™s real, and it hurts. And I want you to know that itâ€™s okay to feel like this. You are not weak. You are not a failure. You are someone who has been trying â€” and that matters more than you can imagine.

You fought hard to earn a scholarship â€” that takes grit, vision, and effort. Youâ€™ve already done something incredible. That same strength that got you there? Itâ€™s still inside you, even if right now it feels buried under all the noise and weight.

Failing a course or falling short of a requirement doesnâ€™t define your story. Not even close. Iâ€™ve seen people bounce back from academic probation, failed courses, total burnout â€” and later thrive, find their way, and even end up doing better than they ever imagined. Your journey doesnâ€™t have to look like anyone else's. Some of the most resilient, brilliant people I know had a messy first year. But it taught them where their limits were â€” and how to heal, grow, and re-approach life with kindness and perspective.

Enrolling in CSC148 and CSC165 shows courage. That is you trying again. That is you standing back up. And that deserves respect.

If youâ€™re open to it, talk to an academic advisor or even a counselor. Not because you're broken â€” but because you matter, and you deserve support. Depression and stress are heavy loads, and no one should have to carry them alone. York has resources â€” people who genuinely care and can help you build a new plan, at your own pace.

Your value is not tied to your GPA. Not your credits. Not your stream status. Your worth is in your persistence, your heart, and your willingness to keep going even when everything feels like itâ€™s crumbling.

You are not lost, even if it feels that way. You are on a detour. And detours can still lead to beautiful destinations.

If no one has told you this today: Iâ€™m proud of you. I believe in you. And Iâ€™m rooting for you. ðŸŒ±

Please hang in there.

â€”Someone who cares",comment,1

There are more resources at UofT and in your life than you might realize.

\- Personal Support: Start with someone you trust and feel emotionally safe with. This could be a friend, mentor, or family member. For me, it was my best friend and I felt comfortable enough to tell them every detail about how I was feeling and what I was going through academically. They didnâ€™t judge, and just having someone truly listen made a big difference. With my parents, I shared the emotional part but not much of the academic struggles because I feared disappointing them. So, itâ€™s okay to pick who you talk to and how much you share. What matters is having someone you feel safe opening up to. And if you donâ€™t have anyone like that right now, thatâ€™s okay. Thatâ€™s what professional support is for.

\- U of T Support Services: 

\> Counselling (Health & Wellness Centre): This is a confidential and non-judgmental space. Theyâ€™ll listen to anything and everything. Honestly, youâ€™re paying for this service anyway, and it can be a huge help just to talk to someone.

\> College Registrarâ€™s Office: They can help with academic recovery plans and connect you to financial resources. There are many academic and financial advisors here at uoft. If you feel like it did not help with the one you tried talking to, you are always welcome to switch and talk to other people until you find someone that you found helpful. One helpful tip when dealing with them is to try and do some personal research as well on what you want to ask them (especially for the scholarship part). Be shameless and make it very clear that you need help.

\> Accessibility Services: If mental health has impacted your academics, please consider registering. I really wish I had done this in my first year. They can offer accommodations and concrete support. They are literally Godsent

\> Scholarship/Financial Aid Advisors: Coming back to this, ask about your current standing and what options you might still have. Knowing early gives you time to plan, act and look for back up solutions if need be. Even if these supports donâ€™t seem helpful at first, **try** anyway. Just trying means youâ€™re still in this.

\> There are many other supports at UofT, the good thing is, sometimes, the supports give you more supports (E.g. the registrar office referring you to the accessibility services) so in time, you will get to know them, but like i mentioned before, you gotta start from somewhere. Of course, it may feel overwhelming, but again, you can always seek help from the supports or the people you trust.

4. Youâ€™re Not Alone And Youâ€™re Not Done (Something to always rememeber)

I know how it feels to work hard to get here, only to feel like everything is falling apart. Itâ€™s scary and disorienting. But this doesnâ€™t mean youâ€™ve failed. It just means your path is different than you expected. And thatâ€™s okay. A detour isnâ€™t the end of the road. Youâ€™re here asking for help. Youâ€™re thinking about your next steps. Thatâ€™s strength, not failure.",comment,3
