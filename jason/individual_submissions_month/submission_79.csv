Try checking if there's any mention of that in the course description, or if the number of P and T hours indicate it.

With a quick look at the [course description](https://utm.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/chm110h5), take note of this bit:

 Total Instructional Hours 36L/12T/10P

So assuming a twelve week semester, you have six tutorials and five practicals. Best guess is that they alternate so you should be absolutely fine.",comment,6
