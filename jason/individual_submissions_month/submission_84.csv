Atomically enrolled in two classes at the same time,user135799765,1m11yk8,https://i.redd.it/kuv8t6tkl5df1.jpeg,1752635642.0,"Hi all, I’m a first year in Vic One and an FLC, so I was automatically enrolled in a few classes. One of my Vic lectures (in which there is only one time so can’t be switched) is at the same time as a tut for my flc. The FLC is showing I can select a different time, but it’s not letting me do so right now. Has anyone else experienced this problem? What do I do? ",submission,13

What is it saying/doing when it's not letting you change? I'd suggest going to your registrar asap to see if they can help you,comment,8
