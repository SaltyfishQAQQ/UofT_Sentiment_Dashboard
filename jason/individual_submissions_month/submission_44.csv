Silly question about exams from someone who hasnâ€™t taken one in 24 years,Potential-Wind8250,1maysjh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1maysjh/silly_question_about_exams_from_someone_who_hasnt/,1753653428.0,"I returned to U of T (St George) this past summer after graduating in 2001. I took a full credit course this summer and as Iâ€™m approaching exam time, Iâ€™m worrying that things might be very different than in the 1900â€™s. 
Back in the day we could only bring pens/pencils and bottled water. (Arts courses so no calculators used) 
Is it the same? Can I bring an iced coffee? ðŸ˜‚
Are exams still on paper? 
Iâ€™m sorry if this seems weird but Iâ€™m too chicken to ask my professor and itâ€™s an online course so no other students I can ask.

You can take them from anywhere but you're basically in a coma-like state for the duration of the exam and have to answer questions in your head which the neuralink picks up. Saves quite a bit of time on the writing honestly.,comment,11
