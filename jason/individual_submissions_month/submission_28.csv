The deadline to register for ATS for this exam period is **July 30****^(th)**, so every single person with ATS will have to register in the span of two days. I do not envy the people working at ATS this week... Plus, its the summer so people are trying to go on vacation, trying to go home to see family, etc. and plane tickets only get more and more expensive the longer you wait. And then they do not accept any kind of pre-planned trip as a reason to defer an exam, even though they don't give us the schedule until like 2 weeks before the exam period.

Actually insane that they think this is acceptable!",comment,30
