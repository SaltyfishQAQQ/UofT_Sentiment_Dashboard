Best of luck with all your classes and make sure you have all the requirements you need to apply to your POSts in April.,comment,5

Your time isn't the best, but it isn't the end of the world at all. If I remember correctly from my first year, not only did I have a later time than you, I made the very bright decision of forgetting to put courses in my enrolment cart. Don't be like me. 


Three things I will mention though. 

1. It's possible you might waitlisted. Don't fret too much, a lot of first year courses shed students (think ECO101 for instance). And if you get waitlisted for winter courses that have fall pre-reqs (e.g. ECO102), its possible that people don't complete the pre-req, so there's a decent shot you might get in, pretty late into the Fall semester. 
2. Always have backup plans. If you find that the section you were planning on enrolling in got filled up too quick, make sure that you have a backup schedule in mind. 
3. You can waitlist for multiple sections of a course at the same time. So if you're waitlisted but also agnostic to which section you get into, then just waitlist all or any of them. 

Good luck!",comment,5

And remember to login before your time starts. You will see a countdown thing. Once your time comes you will just spam the login button and head straight to your courses page.

Remember to prioritize important and courses that have smaller class sizes since those fill up quickly than the larger first year classes.

Have backup timetables on timetable builder so if one tutorial/lab/lecture time is full, you can quickly switch to a different one that works. Also, don't panic and reload/exit the page a lot if ACORN crashes. Good luck!",comment,1

1. Plan your timetable/courses before in time table builder.
2. Look into which classes and profs are higher on your must have list and which ones are secondary and plan your timetable around that.
3. Then look into the availability each section has on ttb which should give you a sense of how likely you are to get it given your late start time.
4. Make back up time tables with all the information as a collective. Do multiple backups and scenarios under the circumstances you donâ€™t get one of your main courses.
5. Print out or save all these scenarios and have them ready to go during the enrolment phase incase you need them.
6. Input your ideal (but also realistic) scenario in your enrolment cart. (I say realistic because obviously donâ€™t put a course/sections thatâ€™s already full the night before).
7. Keep en eye on ttb during the day gilding up to your time. This should give you a sense of which one of the course strategies you built earlier you want to use when you end up enrolling. 
8. Refresh ur page right at 12:15 and your should be good to go. Always make sure you do the courses that are hardest to get in, then which ones are important to you (usually because of program requirements) and then any additional courses in that order.

Having said all this, it hopefully wonâ€™t be as bad as you might think. I did all this before my enrolment in first year because I was in the same boat as you but I found that I didnâ€™t actually end up needing any of it. I just ttb before my enrolment time and made one change to the elective I was taking, other than that everything was smooth sailing. So hopefully you will not run into any trouble either. However, itâ€™s better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it. 

Also, from my experience in my program, it wasnâ€™t really an issue of meeting program requirements as much as it was getting the profs/sections you wanted. I think they build up the system in such a way that you should be able to meet your program requirements through your general enrolment (you might just not get the section you want). Extremely worst case scenario, if you donâ€™t get the course you need to meet year 2 requirements, you can always request your registrar to make accommodations and they usually do if you have a strong case such as it being a requirement of your degree.

Lastly, this is genuinely the toughest it will get. Enrolment will be a lot easier in the coming years because ull get priority over lower years. Hope this helps",comment,1
