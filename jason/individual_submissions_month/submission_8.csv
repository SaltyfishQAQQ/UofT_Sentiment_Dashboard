Apparently people are paying crazy amounts of money to use straight up spy gear like hidden earpieces and button cameras to feed them answers in real-time during exams??

From what Iâ€™ve heard, a lot of these services are targeted at Chinese international students, and it seems like thereâ€™s a whole underground thing going on. Iâ€™m not judging anyone, just genuinely wondering how this works.

Like, how do students find these groups? And how are they even paying for it, considering some of the tribunal cases say that the fees are upwards of $1000? If it costs like 2k to cheat, at that point I'm just gonna open the textbook bruh ðŸ˜­

And this is such a risky method of cheating too. So many of the cases result in multiple-year suspensions or even expulsions. Why would this even be worth the risk?

**Some friends have told me about the pressures they face as Chinese international students to succeed academically. Does that play a major role? Can cheaters' motivations basically be boiled down to ""pressures from family + disposable $$$ + not really wanting to study,"" or is there more to the story than that?**

Feels insane to me, but I guess the pressure some students are under is also next-level. Has anyone else come across this or know more about it, or just wanna share their experience?

Not trying to stir anything up, just kind of fascinated.",submission,125

A lot of Chinese internationals come from rich enablist families. The Chinese school system is one of the most diabolical in the world, but for kids from rich families, they can just apply to a foreign university if they don't do well. Just a few months ago I overheard a mother telling her friends that she doesn't care what her son gets on the test, if he doesn't do well she'll just stick him abroad. UofT is also a prime choice for many because its the highest globally ranked uni that makes international acceptances really stinking easy for cash cow purposes.

Once at uoft, I guess they get agency for the first time away from the pressure and control. In China, high school is 10000% academics 0% life (16h school days), and uni is where they get to go wild. Theres also a widespread misconception that western school is dumb. As a result, they likely haven't had adequate preparation for uoft, and expect it to be much easier than it actually is. Most of them don't speak fluent english. In mat135 there were so many times I've heard a group ask each other what words mean, scrambling to baidu translate, when I *know* they learned the actual math 2+ years ago. I know students who've flunked out of math majors into philosophy/psychology when I *know* their math is good enough, but their english isn't.

After a semester of fooling around, not understanding classes, exam season rolls around. They realize they may not be able to do well, even with studying, because of the language barrier. Cheating is far more normalized in this community, because how available it is and how hard it is to face the shame of failing a class. Theres also the general aversion to studying hard after the trauma of highschool: 'if money solves the issue why put myself through that again?'. They are spread through wechat groups that are lowkey hard to avoid. I've had people stand at the gates of con hall with the group chat qr code approach me, and I found myself in one since before hs even ended. If you look chinese, you've likely been approached too. Once in the group chat, individual people dm you with ads sporadically and especially leading up to exam season. 

Its not a black and white situation. Cheating is wrong, but these kids have basically been set up to fail in a lot of ways, and don't know where or how to ask for real support. They never got time to explore their identities, motivations, or passions, and are probably phenomenally burnt out in ways I don't even want to understand. The wechat groups are lowkey predatory as well, but they function as a semblance of community, esp since chinese kids tend to stick together in foreign places. Sometimes they do manage to turn their undergrad around, though. I know an alumni from york who flunked three courses during covid because the dude he hired to take his finals never showed up. Cost him 2k, and he got demoted from his original major. He ended up hunkering down to study, and graduated with a good cgpa, double major in his original major as well as the one he was demoted to.",comment,90

If they can pay 70-80k CAD in tuition plus living costs, that totals at least $100-120k per year. Affording that shows their family isn't pressuring them to graduate in four years, since most of these students come from wealthy backgrounds. An extra semester or two isn't a big deal for them or their families, mainly because they are well-off. International students rarely receive full scholarships, and there's no student financial aid for international students in Canada; therefore, most of them are wealthy.

The point is, cheating in this way is foolish and lazy; it shows a lack of willingness to do readings, write papers, or study. I see that most international students often drive luxury cars and dress head-to-toe in designer brands. I don't mean to generalize, but if you're spending that much on tuition alone, and your outfit costs my annual tuition,  you're probably wealthy. Almost all international students at U of T are affluent, given the high living costs there. Many own cars, pay high tuition, and live off-campus, where rent can be even more expensive; living in a condo near campus can cost more than on-campus residence.

Using AI to assist with assignments is one thing, but relying entirely on tutoring or cheating services to write your papers or find ways to cheat on exams is simply foolish, dishonest, and quite despicable. We also don't know if they paid their way through high school to achieve top grades. Thatâ€™s not impossible or uncommon, considering that even some students in Ontario attend private schools or online private schools to boost their top 6 Grade 12 marks. In the Canadian undergraduate admission system, only your top 6 grades, that is, Grade 12 marks, count for your application and average.

**Iâ€™m not suggesting that all international students behave this way, but a large majority do, which is unfortunate. Universities need international students and depend heavily on them because of the high tuition fees, which are the main source of income for U of T and nearly all top universities in North America.**

**Please don't ever cheat during exams and tests, nor buy papers. You might get away with it once or twice, but even a 1% chance of getting caught is not worth it, and it's grounds for expulsion, not just suspension or failing the course. Usually, students fail or face academic suspension if they purchase an essay, copy, plagiarize an assignment or project, or use AI on their work.**

**Cheating on the final exam is grounds for expulsion without question 99% of the time. There will be a permanent record of your expulsion and cheating, making it very difficult to attend any other university, especially top ones.**

**REMEMBER:**

**How you do anything is how you do everything. If you cheat and cut corners in university, you will do the same in your professional life, partnerships, relationships and every other facet of life.** 

**Be honest with yourself. If you continue to cheat, thinking you're too smart to get caught, you'll eventually get stuck because you're an impostor who hasn't learned or achieved based on your intellect, hard work, knowledge, or merit.**",comment,3

But as an international student spending $65,000 a year on tuition, over $7,000 on flights, and around $27,000 on housing, the cost of these so-called â€˜servicesâ€™ feels like a bug compared to an elephant when you look at the overall financial burden. :(
And Iâ€™m not even from a wealthy background â€” just an average family trying to support my education.

One issue Iâ€™ve really noticed is that many Chinese international students who apply to UofT werenâ€™t actually educated in an English-speaking environment. (YES, a lot of international schools in China suck and they canâ€™t even teach their students proper English.) Sure, a lot of them pass IELTS, but in reality, that score alone often doesnâ€™t mean theyâ€™re ready to study at the same level as native speakers â€” especially when some even fake their scores. So I guess thatâ€™s why some of them have a hard time understanding and digesting the knowledge in another language other than their native language.",comment,1
