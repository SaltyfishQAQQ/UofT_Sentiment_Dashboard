UofT is great for grad school, but for undergrad a lot of programs have huge classes, profs who would rather be doing research than teaching and who are therefore bad at teaching, and grad students teaching courses. UofT‚Äôs ranking comes from its research, not the quality of the undergrad education.

Well, UofT is a research intensive university and produces a lot of research, compared to all Canadian unversities and even the top 25 best universities globally. 

It is the most prestigious univeristy in Canada and ranks 21st globally and is the only Canadian university consistently ranking in top 25, and only Canadian univeristy ranking in top 50 even. 

Like I mentioned it‚Äôs a research intensive university where a lot of focus and resources is on research output rather than quality of teaching, classrooms, and student engagement. So majority of professors for undergraduate programs and courses are involved in research and write scholarly articles, publish books, work on studies, and contribute to scholarly journals.  

(Although quality of teaching is still exceptional, it‚Äôs not the universities main focus, their main focus is research)

For one, there is not much of a ‚Äúfun‚Äù univeristy experience due to the scale of the university and how many students it has. It has 2 satellite campuses, both equally prestigious and collectively UofT has 80,000 students annually. Due to the large scale of the university, and even the St. George campus alone which is scattered around the heart of downtown Toronto, and the fact that there is tens of thousands of students at St. George alone, there is no sense of community. You might meet someone or make a friend but rarely see them or never see them at all. 
Classes can be 150+ students easily, even for 200 level(second year classes), although by 3rd and 4th year classes due get smaller with 400 level classes being 50 students or less(seminars 30 and below) 

It‚Äôs very academically demanding and challenging especially for undergrad. A UofT undergrad writes more research papers than their counterparts at TMU, YORK or Western in the same program. And there‚Äôs a lot of competition among students to get into their majors and specialists and this is also spread into the student culture.

Professors also do tend to mark on a curve and departments tell them there is a very limited number of A‚Äôs they can give. 

(NOTE: not saying it‚Äôs impossible to get A‚Äôs or a high gpa but it‚Äôs very difficult and you need exceptional organization, work ethic, disciple and hours and hours of studying) much more effort to get a high gpa than any other university in Canada. 


That being said St. George is a bit more prestigious, not because of the quality of education, but because the same programs Uoft Mississauga or Scarborough offer, St. George has higher standards for entry for undergrad. This is due to 3 main factors: 

1. It‚Äôs location and amenities (beautiful and historic campus in the short of downtown Toronto and multiple gyms, more than a dozen libraries and dozens of food courts, close to bars, offices, shops, entertainment, etc etc) in fact many Hollywood movies that portray Harvard or Princeton are filmed on St. George campus(cuz filing in Canada is cheaper than US) 

(Side Note: Even UTM has a very modern, aestehtic and beautiful campus surrounded by erindlae forest and movies like downsizing, and shows like Gen V were filmed there‚Ä¶) 

2. Secondly St. George is more sought after by applicants due to the many co op, research and work opportunities on campus and around campus. You‚Äôre in the heart of downtown Toronto, the 4th largest city in North America and the business, financial and culture hub of Canada.

3. St. George campus offers more programs and more courses per program (although UTM and UTSC students can still enrol in St. George classes and vice versa, but St. George students get priority in St. George classes and vice versa)


There is an emerging and alarming rise in students not finishing in 4 years due to the demanding nature of the university and some take extra classes to either boost their CGPA for grad school, law and med schools. Or they drop or withdraw form courses in first and second year or some (like 10-20%) fail a course in their first or second year. 

Best thing to do is take 4.0 credits in fall/winter and 1.0 in summer and doing that for 4 years to finish in 4 years, instead of taking 6.0 credits in fall/winter(a regular academic year) which most new first years foolishly do. 


The UofT degree is very much valued tho. Not just in Canada, but top firms and companies in US and top grad schools and law schools in US value it a lot and hold it with great regard and prestige. 

Majority of UofT professors are Ivey league graduates or studied at Oxford and Cambridge, and if they aren‚Äôt Ivey league or Oxbridge graduates, they at least taught at Oxbridge or Ivey look schools‚Ä¶And majority like I said are actively doing research and have dozens of scholarly articles, books, and studies published. 

UofT also has the fame because of their name, being the oldest university in Canada and their research output and the quality of that research. 

The college system at St. George for instance is also inspired by Oxford and Cambridge. 

It‚Äôs a great university and the best in Canada,  but if you weren‚Äôt the best student in high school and don‚Äôt have great work ethic, discipline and studying skills don‚Äôt go there. 

It‚Äôs easier to get accepted than to graduate from UofT for your undergraduate degree. While it‚Äôs still hard to get in and in fact much harder than any other Canadian university, graduating is even harder because of all the reasons I mentioned",comment,3
