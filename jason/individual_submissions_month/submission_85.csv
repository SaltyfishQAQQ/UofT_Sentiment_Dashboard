**As a rule of thumb,** a full time workload of 5.0FCE is considered roughly equivalent to a full time job. You'll sometimes hear this glossed as doing two hours of work out of class for every hour in class (similar to the ""Carnegie standard"" for measuring credit hours), so that for every hour of lecture, practical, and tutorial, you're spending two hours on your own doing readings, self-study, and assignments. This averages out to about 6-9 hours per course per week, or 40-45 hours per week for 5.0FCE since most courses are 3 hours in class, with a few outliers of 2 or 4 hours.

**In practice**, not every student spends the same time as expected. Some weeks will be simply workload light compared to others (think the first week of class vs midterms). Meanwhile, some students will need to spend more time on a course they're less familiar with than one they're more experienced in, or just don't care enough to choose to invest that much time, etc. Or, it might be that you're an experienced fourth year student who's taking a few 200-level courses, so that you have a lot of practice and familiarity going in. Still, as a rule of thumb, we can see that 6.0FCE will come with an expected workload that averages to around 50 hours a week. That's a lot for most people.

**Importantly**, while this is usually thought of as an extra time commitment, that extra time commitment can encroach on other courses since you have limited time in a week. It's not (only) about the extra effort another course requires, but also its possible impacts on other courses, like: (a) having less downtime between assignments or tasks to rest, to let concepts sink in, to make use of office hours or writing centres, etc; (b) less time to work on any given assignment, since the (e.g.) two weeks between a paper being assigned and due are now being spread across even more courses and assignments, or a problem set with a 48h window overlapping with your presentation date in a seminar, etc; (c) more opportunities to make simple mistakes confusing instructions, policies, deadlines, concepts, etc between classes that can impact grades even with invested effort; (d) more stressful midterm and exam periods beyond usual; etc.

**So it's not impossible**, but my experience is students can drastically underestimate the impact of just one course, and often (but not always!) start to see their grades slide below what they're used to. You'd need to be very selective about what you're taking, be proactive in starting early on assignments and scheduling your time, be prepared for the possibility of making sacrifices (choosing to prioritize one assignment over another, taking the lateness penalty, dropping courses), and commit to regular self-study even in any ""off"" weeks where nothing is due to offset the busy weeks where you have three midterms, a problem set, and a paper due.

**Lastly**, keep in mind you can always sign up for 6.0FCE and drop one (or more) courses along the way. It's not really an all or nothing decision that you can't take back.",comment,8

first semester it was okay cause i had 5 stem courses and 1 easier course but second sem was tough with 6 stem courses with 6 exams LOL

if you can, try to take 5 and maybe take summer classes or at least have an easier class in there so that you can at least TRY and have a life and be able to go to the gym/prioritize health and just have a little time outside school",comment,5

The only draw back is that my grades are not the greatest lol (still got some 4.0s but not a ton), but im still passing and on track to graduate ðŸ«¡

If your entering first year id suggest to try taking 6 and worst case dropping one class, the tuition is still the same whether you take 4, 5, or 6 classes. 

Good luck! Most people are capable enough to take 6 courses you just need good time management (aka just working a lot when the time comes)",comment,2
