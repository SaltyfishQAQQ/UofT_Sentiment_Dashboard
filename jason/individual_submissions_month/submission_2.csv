for example, lets say you‚Äôre super shy and are often trying to better yourself and speak up and telling yourself be more social be more outgoing etc. in doing things that are natural to you, you might unlock a character that is SO FUCKING SHY that it becomes a show in itself, a generous gift of putting your shyness in full display instead of trying to conceal it, which becomes endearing and joyful to the audience, and in turn makes you recognize, understand and accept that shyness in you more, and perhaps even love it!

theres a lot of that sense of being present and being generous, and letting that lead you to being playful. there was wonderful work and incredible growth and it rlly connects u to your classmates. personally, in the middle of the u of tears of it all, it really made me feel like a human being again, alive, connected to people, creative and real. i think anybody with an open heart would take something valuable away from it",comment,27
