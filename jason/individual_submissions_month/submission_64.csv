pretty much all buildings should be open at 5pm to walk through assuming you're visiting on a weekday while classes are in session since some classes can go from 6-8pm",comment,10

I remember one time there was a gun discharged or something serious like that in Sid Smith, and they cancelled classes… in the part of the building it occured in.

One day I had to email Alfonso Gracia-Saz (RIP GOAT) that the go trains weren’t even running because the snow was too thick, so I literally PHYSICALLY COULDN’T get to campus. Classes still happened.

UTM and UTSC got closed for snow a bunch though.",comment,5
