I got a email yesterday saying my admission conditional wasnâ€™t met my top 6 including bio and English needed to be a 75 but mines was a 74 Iâ€™m gonna fill out the form but Iâ€™m really scared is there still hope do I have a good chance ?

Top 6 including English and biology and English needed to be over a 70% which I got ( this is for life science utsc) 

I have PCOS and got medication and doubled my dose by my doctor and I took x4 a day starting semester 2 which explains my average % drop. I dealt with body issues, always feeling sick, and tried my hardest to do my best in school during that hard time and managed to get 1% lower then my conditional.

I plan on filling out the special circumstances form - admission conditional request form - and I plan on asking my doctor for a note about my PCOS and my medication prescribed to help my case and submit that.

Do you guys think Iâ€™m okay, and will get accepted? Iâ€™ve tried searching my situation here on Reddit but I canâ€™t seem to find anything, any insight / opinion / past experience will help, thank you so much.

I hope you have a good day, thank you. ",submission,16

They emphasized that if there truly was something significant that got in the way of a conditional acceptance, which it seems like you have a case for, to email them and explain the situation. They seemed quite graceful so it's worth a shot to email them and offer documentation in support.",comment,3
