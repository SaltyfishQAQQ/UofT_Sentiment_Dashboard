Why Choose the ASIP Program: Experiences and Tips from a Top Student,study-lover,1m2ggxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1m2ggxu/why_choose_the_asip_program_experiences_and_tips/,1752779598.0,"**My Profile:**

* Undergrad, Started university in Fall 2021, CS Specialist, GPA 3.9+.
* Received [Samuel Beatty In-Course Scholarship](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/undergraduate/current-and-prospective-students/undergraduate-awards/) from the Computer Science department.
* Currently working in the US at a FAANG company as an intern.

  
**What is ASIP Program?**

[Official Link](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/experiential-learning/internships/asip)

* Basically, it's a co-op program that provides you with the flexibility to do a co-op work term (12-20 months).
* There is a program fee, but it becomes quite affordable if you can secure a job and earn a salary.
* If you are an international student, it allows you to maintain full-time status while working during the Fall and Winter semesters. However, it doesn't count towards your PR application.

**Why do I write this post?**

Without ASIP, I couldn't secure **any** internship opportunities.

When applying for jobs, there's always that checkbox: ""Are you in the co-op program at your university?"" Unless you're exceptionally talented, it's nearly impossible to get an interview if you answer ""No.""

I joined ASIP in the fall of my second year, and honestly, I had no clue about finding internships at that time. My resume was terrible. The ASIP offered appointments to help improve resume and their courses were very helpful in preparing me for interviews.

I started looking for internships in the winter semester of my second year. The job market in 2023 was brutal, and many companies laying off employees. I applied to over 300 positions through ASIP portals, LinkedIn, and Indeed. I only received two interviews: one from LinkedIn and one from the ASIP portal. I didn't pass the interview for the one from LinkedIn, but fortunately, I pass the one from the ASIP portal.

The interview from the ASIP portal was with a big company starting with ""R"". During that interview, I encountered a exact same question that was covered in the ASIP interview preparation course. That's how I landed my first internship. I was the only one among my friends who managed to secure an internship that summer.

Some companies exclusively hire students from ASIP, which is how I got my second long-term internship with a big company. The advantage of a long-term internship is that you'll be given real projects that would typically go to full-time employees, rather than the simpler tasks given to short-term interns. This also increases your chances of receiving a return offer.

**Any tips on landing first internship?**

* If you're just starting out with internships, you likely don't have many connections yet. Enhance your resume by including side projects you've worked on, and have it reviewed by experienced professionals for feedback. 
* The key is to apply to as many positions as possible. If you land an interview, be ready to discuss the details of your resume and answer related questions. Once you've secured your first internship, finding the next one will become significantly easier.
* Don't be too stressed if you can't find one; ignoring peer pressure makes everything easier :)

**Questions?**

If you have questions about the program, please email [asip@utoronto.ca](mailto:asip@utoronto.ca). I'm just a student, so I might not have the answers. For any questions about my experience or if you want suggestions, please ask in the comments. I'm quite busy these days, but I'll do my best to respond over the weekend.",submission,22

theyre super lenient too and they teach you pretty much everything you need to know about starting internships and coops

>  I was the only one among my friends who managed to secure an internship that summer.

The success rate is so low that you might as well apply externally.

My advice to any high school students considering UTSG CS ASIP: Just go to UTSC CS Co-op. The program is built around co-op, has the ability to apply to 4, 8, 12 or 16 month co-ops at any time, shares the same job board as UTSG CS ASIP and you can graduate a year earlier too.",comment,0

1. yes, as long as you are enrolled in the program you will have to pay the fees for the courses. since most people will secure internships while they're in/after taking the ASIP courses, you will be paying as you search. it generally costs an extra \~$1k in tuition per year
2. no, you will still pay the standard tuition over 4 years, you won't pay tuition on your work term unless you decide to take classes on top of your work term. you are also considered a full-time student while on your term

quick edit: i was wrong, you do have to pay an ancillary fee while on your work term to keep up the 'enrolled student' status and be able to use all the uoft facilities and stuff. this is about $1000 and does not include any tuition",comment,1

Also, just because you don't need to be full-time status during the summer for a summer internship doesn't mean the whole full-time student thing is useless. What if you are doing a fall or winter Canadian internship then you want to do a summer US internship?

I know someone who wouldn't have been able to do their internship at one of the big quant firms (think Citadel, Jane Street, HRT) without their coop program. I think because it's hard to get into ASIP retroactively, and impossible if you drop out, everyone should enrol in it.",comment,1

However, there are many 2nd year courses that are directly or indirectly prerequisite to other mandatory courses. For example in CS, to take advanced systems courses you need to take CSC369 which requires CSC258 and CSC209, which requires CSC207. If you late CSC207 late, then you push back CSC209 (potentially by a year because it's sometimes only offered in the winter), which pushes back CSC369, which could mean that you'll literally be unable to take some upper year systems courses depending on your schedule.",comment,1
