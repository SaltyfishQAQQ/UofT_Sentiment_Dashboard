Is this a bad thing? Only exception is my elective where there is a pretty short tutorial but the lecture is online asynchronous.

None of my days stretch past 5 pm, I'm just really trying to save money commuting with the gotrain so I wouldn't be doing this if I didn't have to lol. My course enrolment is tomorrow.",submission,15

I did the same this year lol and am a commuter. I use TTC rather than GO since I'm close to campus, but honestly, it depends on the person. Both of my days start at 11 am so I have plenty of time to get to the station and get to class. And plus, as commuters, SAVE MONEY WHEREVER POSSIBLE! So I think you're totally valid for doing that.",comment,10

Iâ€™d start at 11 am and have classes till 6 or 9 (when I had a lab) and Iâ€™d rather do that twice a week than be at the university every day.,comment,6

you just have to consider your priorities when planning your schedule, which youll learn with time! its definitely doable for a semester, and if you find its too much you know for next year!",comment,3

I am a commuter that uses the train for 3 hours per day, I prefer having school 3-4 days per week (if youâ€™re not working) because it really helps with your social life here. As a commuter + spending sm energy back to back during your classes, you will likely not have enough energy/time for socializing after ur classes. Also depending on how you study, sometimes studying at home is less productive than at school. I would say that if you use the universityâ€™s resources such as the library, gyms, clubs, etc, then itâ€™s more worth it to spend more on travel",comment,1

It's perfectly doable and would reduce your commuting time/costs, but given you're a first year I think you'll want to spend more time on campus to meet people and hang out/study with friends, explore Toronto, etc. If socialising isn't important at all, then go for it, but I would try to do 4 days on campus as a first year to be honest.",comment,1

Here's some things I learned through the years:

\- Bring a packed lunch and/or snacks! Even though buying food on campus is convenient, it's likely that you'll have back to back classes and won't have time to stop.  

\- During your breaks between classes (if you have any), try doing something social, go to a club event, go to the student commons (there's usually something going on), make friends and try a cafe around campus. It can get really depressing just going back and forth to school and home the rest of the days without social interaction. Also, if there are extra curricular events that are on your off days, I would highly suggest coming on campus just to attend, very important for networking, social life, and for sanity. 

\- Use your time on the GO Train effectively! Try to do your readings, but it's ok to sleep or even watch a show if you need your brain to turn off during your commute.

\- Don't underestimate how tired you'll be when you get home. I usually had plans to do homework and assignments after I got home, but usually crashed. Give yourself grace, plan out your study schedule for when you're home so you can relax after on-campus days.",comment,1
