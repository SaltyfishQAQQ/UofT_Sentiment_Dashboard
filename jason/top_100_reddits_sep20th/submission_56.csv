I swear my stomach shrank from skipping meals because why the heck is food so expensive. ttc already cost bank and you want me to buy a little bowl of food for $10(thats half a week of commuting)

somebody is prob gonna tell me to go focus on my studies(i prob will in a bit) i just rlly needed to vent. having class feeling unwell rlly sucks",submission,57

In fact, sometimes during exam season, you are too busy to crash out. The first year of undergrad was personally the toughest for me due to the adjustments. Being a commuter and making friends is always a challenge (I highly recommend clubs and other activities for this). To be honest, meeting friends after high school never gets easier.

I am currently in a PhD program at U of T, only doing Required Work from 1st Year to today.

Also, I know the Metropass is still expensive, but if you commute enough, consider the Post-Secondary Pass.",comment,24

Obviously you should do everything, but if you've done that required work and have no gas left in the tank don't push yourself to the extremes.

Friend-wise, you're going to have to put yourself out there and initiate conversation. If you see a group of people you think you might want to hang out with, slowly worm your way in. Keep doing this daily until you're acknowledged and people know your name. Also, hang out after class, even if it's just for a bit to get food or study in the library. You'd be surprised by how these little activities make a big difference in the long-run. 

Romance wise, if you have a spark with someone and you know they're single, you make time to hang out. Start off as friends and get to know them before vocalizing romantic intentions. People, especially students, want something that doesn't feel like it's work. You message them little things here and there, eventually ask them if they want to hang out one-on-one, then you see where that goes.

In terms of affordable food, I will defend the honor of The Red Truck to the death, especially for their $3.00 tempura hand roll. That value is almost unheard of nowadays in this country. Other places off campus include: 
- Banh Mi Nguyen Huong (Spadina)
- Juicy Dumpling (Spadina)
- Hero Dumpling (Yonge)
- Banh Mi Boys (Yonge)

Best of luck!",comment,8

I find it pretty helpful to listen to music and study during my commute (2 hours per day). I've already crashed out twice (overwhelmed by assignments). I also don't do the recommended work, simply because I need time to relax. My sleep schedule is already cooked too lol. It's totally normal to feel that way this early tbh. I recommend joining study groups or joining gcs to make friends, it really worked well for me! Just keep pushing slowly and don't overwhelm yourself too much, we'll make it :D",comment,1

I‚Äôm back in 4th year after almost 25 years, and I think it might be even harder now (post pandemic + social media = nightmare). Commuting is extra rough. u of T is a hard school to find your way at, even in residence, so you have some extra challenges. You‚Äôre not alone in your feelings.

The hard truth is while you don‚Äôt have to go through this alone, only you can find your way through it. Pull your closest people in ventventvent. It gets better, I promise.",comment,1
