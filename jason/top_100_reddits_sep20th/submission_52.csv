After a delay and a ""stern warning"", they will release the funds on the promise that the association will ""do better""...and the cycle will continue. They once had the forethought to have a liaison to the student groups who would keep an eye that proper recordkeeping, etc. was happening - but it was a low wage position and was quickly swallowed up in cuts. At U of T, it is far easier to hire for a $100,000 + executive position than for frontline staff - just check out the sunshine list!",comment,2

I was part time for a year and full time the rest. The only difference was my health benefits were slightly shittier while paying almost exactly the same fees. I’d rather have full time benefits ~50$ extra dollars a year. What else does it do other than benefits? I was asked to run in 2021 and I couldn’t figure out what the point was other than to put it on a resume as a BS experience. 
Show me something tangible that it does that isn’t already covered by the full time one, instead of just creating a non existent need by saying ‘insignificant’ branch. 

It’s like saying prime numbers should have their own numbers system cause they are an insignificant branch of numbers.  There isn’t a need to make them significant when the needs are identical.",comment,2
