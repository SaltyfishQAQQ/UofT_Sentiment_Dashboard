It'll always be like this, but with due time you'll be swamped with work to the point where you'll laugh at yourself for being nervous. 

I will say one thing though, first impressions matter a lot. You have a chance every year to 'remake' yourself. Don't hesitate to grab peoples contact info or exchange names etc,. Regardless if you see them as friends, knowing more people will never hurt you. 

By the 2nd or 3rd week you'll be in the groove, and hopefully won't have any regrets with the way you started the year.",comment,4

Your first week won’t be content heavy so take the opportunity to socialize and meet new people. If you can, go to campus 30 minutes (or however much you want) and walk around and figure out where your classes are. It’s a great way to get familiar with your schedule and calm the nerves. Other than that, make sure to talk to people and initiate the convo, even if you consider yourself more introverted. The first week is the best opportunity to meet people before everyone is too focused on work. If you aren’t sure where to start, just ask them about themselves, people love talking about themselves!",comment,1
