However, coming back to school itâ€™s definitely a lot harder. I just remind myself thatâ€™s itâ€™s only 8 months (for myself). My social life looks different - I see classmates and hangout during breaks, versus donâ€™t see my not school friends much.

The core group of friends that I've maintained throughout the years are the people that I study with regularly, thus turning my studying into 'socialization' in a way. It makes studying feel significantly less tiring and a lot more tolerable, where we'll often take our breaks together and leave together afterwards to maybe get a meal or take a walk before calling it a night. If I wasn't able to successfully socialize with my friends this way, I would definitely struggle to maintain my social life.

I also set up days I set aside to work on a given task together with a certain group of people, which also helps me keep on track with my studying. For example, several friends and myself all do research outside of school, so we set aside a day to work together in someone's lab to get a chunk of research work done.

It's easy for people to simply say 'make time', when sometimes, you genuinely cannot make time. Please don't feel like you're somehow behind some curve because you cannot find as much time outside of studies as others, but also make sure to go about your university life in a healthy and maintainable way. Everyone just has to find their own way to make their balance, where for me, its come through my friend group being my study group. Hopefully this helps!",comment,15

Honestly I didn't really have a life until maybe the second half of third year. I think one thing that helped me get a little better at ""having a life"", was almost treating going out with friends *as* an assignment. Like, force myself to make time for at least one or two excursions a week. Basically like taking a non-credit 6/7/8th course :)). It really is all about your mindset. If you view hanging out as a non-negotiable, you will find a way to make time. I'm saying this as someone who generally likes to keep himself very busy with academic work. Good luck!",comment,3

2) Grades aren't everything. There are lots of programs and opportunities, especially at a place like U of T, even if you don't get into the program/next step you planned for, there'll always be doors for you.

3) ""Having a life"" will help. You need balance, going out and doing things from time to reasonable time is good for you.

4) Take fewer courses and/or an extra year if you have to. I did, it helped a lot. Everyone learns and grows at their own pace, don't let the pressure to be perfect burn you out.",comment,2

I ended up going part-time for the majority of my degree, which you can do if you go to your registrar and ask to be changed to a per-course fee structure, so it's cheaper. I went full-time for the last 2Â½ years (I did 6 years in total). Now I'm doing better, and back at UofT for grad school. 

It'll come back to bite you in the end if you can't sustain the things that nourish you â€“ a social life, hobbies, engaging in a community one way or another, eating well, etc. So think about decreasing your course load or something like that if you can't keep up with both school and having a life.

Account for your energy, getting a good night's rest, taking care of your body and mind, doing things you enjoy, and having a social life.Â For me, that means I take 2 courses and work 12h/week. I have enough time for health, hobbies, social life, and 8 hours of sleep most nights.Â 


2. Yap with everyone

Talk to people in your classes. Talk to them during lecture breaks. Talk to them while waiting in line to speak to the professor. Talk to them before and after classes.Â 

What are your hobbies and interests? There's probably a club for that at uoft. Or maybe not, then you get to make your own. Try a bunch out and see what you enjoy. Go to random events on campus that sound cool to you. There's always something to go on campus.Â 



3. Ask people to hang out outside of classes/work

Invite them out for coffee or lunch or studying together at the library or going to one of the many campus events (there are so many things going on campus) or skating at the varsity or [insert any activity]. You need to repeatedly see someone to be active friends. A lot of people will be too busy with grinding at Robarts to spend time with you. But there are people who will enjoy spending time with you and being your friend.Â 


4. Use your resources!

Uoft has so many resources to help you succeed. You can see mental health counsellors, learning strategists, academic advisors, writing instructors, career counsellors, etc. etc. you're paying for it in your tuition, and these are all people who literally get paid to help you succeed.Â ",comment,1
