Your note has a drawing of a sunflower on it and there's a clue about yellow treasure in the poem. Is there a section of the library that is near a sunny window, or has books on Van Gogh? Perhaps use the 189 as a Dewey decimal reference. You can't let this go. Your mission is too important.",comment,91

I'm a librarian at the Fisher Library, and while we didn't have the next clue, I mentioned this to a few of my co-workers and one of them was on a \*mission\*. He went over to ***shelf #189*** (F 2173 M ‚Äì F 2278 L), which is ***yellow***, and sandwiched between the 3rd and 5th editions of ***Personalities Caribbean*** (F 2175 P4) he found this note:

""Dear Explorer,

You've journeyed far; your quest is almost done,  
To find the treasure, just look where it's begun.  
Return to the spot where your adventure took flight,  
Then glance slightly right ‚Äî keep your head held high.

On the top shelf, a name will appear,  
A great Macedonian warrior, written in the tongue of romance.  
In the pages of Athens, where history entwines,  
Your treasure awaits, in the stories it defines!""

It's signed ""The Great"".

Seems pretty straightforward to me (certainly a lot simpler than the last clue!) but so as not to ruin the fun, I'll let you run with it!",comment,3
