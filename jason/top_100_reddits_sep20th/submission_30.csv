long rant about my personal experience with u of t counselling services,436sheeps,1n62oav,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n62oav/long_rant_about_my_personal_experience_with_u_of/,1756765499.0,"I am a graduate student, last year I got referred by a professor to u of t counselling services due to my bad mental health, it was so bad that the prof. literally called the counselling office and set up the appointment for me. I poured my heart out to this counsellor and told them many personal embarrassing details about my life, because I wanted help so badly, all I wanted were weekly sessions with a therapist or advice on how to get connected to a therapist. In response the counsellor

* \- berated me for not having a recent diagnosis and not knowing weird DSM details like 'what kind of anxiety I have'
* \- insinuated that I didn't need medication because my prescription came from a family doctor and not a psychiatrist, saying, 'he really shouldn't be able to prescribe you with psychiatric medication, it's not in his professional capacity to do so' actually my family doctor is specially licensed to diagnose and prescribe these things, he told me this himself
* \- berated me for not signing up for accessibility services; when I asked how to sign up she said 'it's too late now anyways'
* \- said it didn't seem like counselling would help me because I was 'too busy' with my work
* \- was completely dismissive of anything I had to say, for example, when I told her an example of legitimately terrible bullying I faced in the past she said, 'it sounds like they were just worried about you and didn't know how to react' in a really condescending way
* \- i told her that one of my biggest barriers to getting help in the past was that my parents didn't believe in mental illness (they are much more understanding now though), she responded by basically doing the exact same thing I told her was a barrier to me, reinforcing all of those beliefs
* \- she implied the entire time that I was only at the session to get a free pass out of my academic responsibilities, that was not true, I wanted help so badly
* \- she asked me these super personal questions like 'do you SH' 'have you attempted ...' etc. I answered honestly because I wanted help. I feel like if you ask people questions like that as a mental health professional you are putting them in a vulnerable position, you have a duty to treat them with respect and care, and not be a bully. 

I left the session regretting so much that I had ever gone, and also very stressed that all of my sordid personal information is now permanently on record at U of T in the hands of these people who clearly do not give a darn if I live or die. I cried for the rest of the day basically, because I felt so alone like nothing I did would ever be enough to deserve help or understanding. And this is as a grad student with a direct reference from a prof. I cannot imagine how much worse it is for undergrads and such. I couldn't even tell the prof. why I ended up not continuing with counselling because I was so shook up and it was all very personal, I didn't want to seem like I was complaining or being ungrateful, so that was really awkward because it made me look like I was just blowing them off or being irresponsible or difficult. 

Anyways I just want you all to know that if U of T counselling does this to you, you are not alone, you should treat these interactions for what they are, a way to protect the liability of the university and a bureaucratic process to get you accommodations or referrals, not a way to get genuine mental health help; don't give them too much personal information if that is something you're uncomfortable with being on file at the school. GO INTO THE APPOINTMENT WITH A GOAL IN MIND ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED FROM THEM, MAKE SURE YOUR DOCUMENTS ARE IN ORDER, THAT YOU HAVE INFORMATION AND RECEIPTS TO BACK IT UP OTHERWISE THEY WILL NOT GIVE YOU ANYTHING. 

tldr; I am pretty sure if I went up to a random person on the street and trauma dumped they would give me more empathy, advice, and support than a u of t counsellor ",submission,131

Iâ€™ve forgotten the exact names but one was all psychiatrists and the other all psychologists. I went to the psychiatric one first; my experience was not nearly as bad as yours but nonetheless utterly unsatisfactory. I went to the other (psychologist) one and was treated with kindness and respect. They assigned me a counsellor who was sympathetic and skilled. A great experience. It also pointed out the difference between psychiatrists and psychologists. Theyâ€™ve changed the system all around since but keep trying, donâ€™t give up. Avoid people who only have an MD. You want somebody with a PhD. Good luck.",comment,30

I would not worry too much about UofT per se having access to your personal information. I'm pretty sure that confidentiality standards hold at UofT counselling as much as any other counselling service.

I would however suggest that it takes a while to find a competent counsellor who is a good fit for you. It sounds like you got a bad fit, and it is asking a lot to find someone when you need it the most. If you have the bandwidth I suggest you low-key look for someone who \*is\* a better fit so that you have the support you need when you need it. This may require you to look outside UofT, which may make you less worried about confidentiality, but may also cost more than what is covered.

Edit to add: Not just bad fit, the person you had sounds awful.",comment,34

I had a very bad experience there too. I was struggling big time with my mental health because of a lot of issues related to my program, supervisor and surrounding environment. 
Went to UofT counseling because I absolutely couldn't afford any other kind of therapy. 
It was the most useless and frustrating experience ever. I found their tone...very patronizing? Like they were talking down to a child. Made a short term plan with weekly appointments. The counselor straight up cancelled without any notice or rescheduling at the second appointment.",comment,14

If you have anxiety, then you will probably need the support long-term, not just for 5 or 10 sessions (speaking from experience here). You can find a therapist using this website. Filter according to your preferences (gender, specialty, type of therapy, etc...): [https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapists?search=toronto](https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/therapists?search=toronto)

The folks at accessibility services were surprisingly helpful to me, and I recommend getting in touch with them regardless of what process you follow. They'll allow you to register with them even if you don't have a diagnosis, and will help you get a funding to get an official diagnosis if that's what you need. 

As a graduate student, you get $500 coverage for mental health through the GSU. If you are a TA, you have access to the CUPE top up plan, which bumps that to $5000 (union strong!). If you are not a CUPE member, you can easily become one. You only need to work for 15 hours. Those can be exam invigilation in the exam centre. 

I wish you strength in the face of all the horribleness ðŸŒ¹",comment,14

Best kept secret at UofT (for some reason) is the OISE psych clinic- they have good student therapists I was extremely happy with my experirence there couple of years ago. Look up ""OISE psychology clinic adult services"" or something, leave them a message. They'll get back to you in Sept and you can see a therapist all year.  Its student therapists who are being trained and supervised, sliding scale is available, for UofT students it was like $40 per session and it should be **fully covered by your insurance.**  I don't work for them or have any connection but found them really good.  Worth a shot anyways since it is covered.",comment,11

i have not accessed u of t's counselling services myself but have used other universities' counselling programs and fit can be a real issue. this person sounds like they were not empathetic in any way when you were vulnerable and i'm sorry you experienced that. i am a grad student at the oise m.ed for counselling psychology and oise has a low-cost clinic as well that i've heard really good things about: [https://www.oise.utoronto.ca/psychology-clinic/adult-services](https://www.oise.utoronto.ca/psychology-clinic/adult-services)

as a quick note, as part of intake, therapists often will ask really intimate questions about self harm etc. ideally that is done in a really gentle and validating manner which it sounds like this person was unable to give you. i'm so sorry you had a bad experience and i hope that you do continue to find someone to talk to as i know from personal experience, it can make a huge difference esp when you're in academia and struggling with very difficult family dynamics.",comment,5

I can't remember specifics because it was a couple years ago now, but I recall leaving the appointment feeling _offended_ by how much attitude and dismissal the woman treated me with. I usually try to give these services a try because of how pitifully limited mental health resources are in Canada, but whatever she said to me was enough to make me decline a second appointment.

I agree with what another commenter said about seeking someone with a PhD. The education most ""counselors"" and ""social workers"" receive is shockingly limited considering the power they have over vulnerable people.",comment,4

I think also because the university is my employer, it just made me feel uncomfortable to blend professional and personal life in that way.

There is also some stigma of mental health and how you act in these situations can affect the medical treatment you receive, like if people think you're crazy or irrational they treat you like less of a person. Why do I trust reddit more? Idk. it's anonymous and I assume this post will be lost to time eventually, you know?
