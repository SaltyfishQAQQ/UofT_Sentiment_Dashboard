"flight cancelled, missing first day of orientation 😭",antivasmr,1myn91m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1myn91m/flight_cancelled_missing_first_day_of_orientation/,1756013217.0,"long story short, my flight with air canada got cancelled and they rescheduled me for a later flight. due to this, ill miss first day of orientation and will probably be too busy to even attend the second day.

dont think its too big of a deal, but also kinda upset because i would assume the first day is especially important to make new friends and stuff 😭

  
edit: even though i missed first day of orientation, i still ended up making a lot of good friends and everyday has been so fun! ",submission,33

also know meeting new people is a numbers game, sometimes you get lucky with the first person, sometimes it takes a few tries. i think you’ll do great if you just put yourself out there",comment,52
