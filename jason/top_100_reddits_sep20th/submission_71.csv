In my fourth year and have no friends lol I crave social interaction,persoba20,1na9myv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1na9myv/in_my_fourth_year_and_have_no_friends_lol_i_crave/,1757189797.0,"So basically I’m in my fourth year and I have no real close friends. Im a commuter so that could be part of the reason, but I just don’t have a sort of circle. It’s partly my fault because I went through a super rough time the last year and a half and just never showed up (not that they texted but I didn’t either) so I sort of feel like I’m starting over. 

I just feel kind of alone on campus and would love people to just yap and study with. 

I’m in the work and organizations major and bioethics minor and I like video games (watching them anyway lol) shopping, anime, and that stuff. 

I’ll be a good friend I promise my inbox is opennn 😩😩",submission,43

This is a pretty common trend I hear about from people at universities all over North America, specifically high achieving ones like UofT. Also, socializing has become particularly... weird... after the pandemic.
