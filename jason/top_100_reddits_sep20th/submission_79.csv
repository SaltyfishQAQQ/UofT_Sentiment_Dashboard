Then move on to something more interesting once you break the ice

Outside of lectures, if they're sitting down you can kinda do the same, but probably need to be more bold. Say something like hey, I like your outfit, let her acknowledge, do you mind if I join you for a minute?

If they're not sitting down, but still stationary, you can kinda do the same, but now you need hella confidence, and take into account that you'll probably see them again if you misread her signal. Ideally here you have some sort of ""in"". Easy ones are pointing something out about them, like tattoos, specific brands, specific logos, maybe you saw them somewhere, maybe you're waiting for a lecture to start and she looks bored asf, if you're in line maybe it's slow or what to order, etc.

If they're not stationary, you need game beyond my own lol, so just gg go next",comment,6

It's literally one of the easiest skills one can acquire. I was shy and introverted, too. You don't have to be Harvey Spectre-level confident or charismatic, just breathe, don't talk too fast and think before you talk. And don't overthink it, no one is cooler, smarter or better than you. Everyone is self-conscious and nervous; some just hide it better than others. Get out of your comfort zone and try it out.

I'm 25 now, and I've been at UFT for 7 years. From my experience, the student or overall person who can talk, befriend people easily, connect and socialize gets farther ahead than the quiet introverted student with a 4.0 CGPA. The same apples are in the workplace and the dating market. No matter how good, talented, etc., you are, if you don't talk, people don't notice.

It's because there is a human factor in everything, in any job, office, institution, department, and any area of life. levergae it and use it to yoru advanatge. It's as simple as small talk. Find one thing you have in common and go with that and explore that. I've gotten A's in classes strictly because of this. Ofc it is based on merit, but you'd be surprised that if you make people feel good, wanted, and make them feel and sound interesting, and sometimes they truly are, then they would like you and would want to do you favours.

I understand that maybe during class, you might be annoyed or want to pay attention. I was just talking more generally, for context. For the first three years at uni, I made zero friends or connections. And my mental health and social life were miserable. But with trial and error, slowly, I built a nice network and made quality friends.",comment,1

2. Say ""Hello"" as you sit down
3. See if they start talking about something.
4. If other people are talking, pretend to be curious and add to the conversation
5. Use an actual question about campus or course syllabus or something similar to start a conversation
6. if you fail, don't worry too much
7. prioritize people you have ran into before / share classes with you / you sat before with

If you want a low-pressure way to meet people, Hart House drop-ins might be something to try. There's a Weekly Social Stop, Get Crafty, Queer & Trans sessions or drop-in fitness classes.
