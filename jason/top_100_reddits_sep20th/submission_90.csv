so for reference i found out that someone from the same class as me commutes using ttc. I saw them today at VMC and didnâ€™t approach them because my bus was here. I donâ€™t have their socials or anything (so i canâ€™t even text them about it) so i was wondering if it would be weird to approach them next week after class and ask them about if they commute and if they would maybe want to ride together. Personally i would love it if someone asked me this because i know how isolating the commute can be but i know it can be a bit strange too.

Let me know becayse iâ€™m scared itâ€™s gonna come off as stalkerish or weird. Especially because iâ€™m a very awkward and shy personâ€¦ 

Thanks!

Im also super introverted so this feels hypocritical to say but push yourself out of your comfort zone and take opportunities like that.

 And if they say no dont take it too personally its likely that they might be exhausted during their commute and need the alone time to recharge or something like that.",comment,24

The reason it feels hypocritical is because, at least in part, it's a ""do as I say, not as I do"" scenario. Keep in mind that you can be right even if you don't practice what you preach. The problem arises when you consider *why* they don't do their own, potentially good (yet unproven by personal example),Â  advice.",comment,1
