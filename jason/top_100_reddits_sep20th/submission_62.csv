The only way I’ve used AI was when I had trouble finding another argument for my paper and I asked chatGPT. I got a great idea, but just went back and wrote it myself. 
The problem is that when I put my paper through an AI detector, it came back saying 24%! How does that work? My classmate joked and said it was too well written. Hahaha. It flagged the first two sentences of my intro and a couple other random sentences (Including one cited quote!). 
Is it going to get flagged by turnitin?

While there are certain language tendencies generative AI likes to use, there's no real way to detect if a piece of writing is AI generated or not. Take em-dashes for example. Everyone these days is like, 'if it has an em-dash, ChatGPT wrote it,' when literally every anti-AI fanfic writer on Wattpad and AO3 loves using them and has been using them since the 2010s. 

For fun a couple summers ago, some TAs and I fed different AI detectors a plethora of different papers, including ones we wrote ourselves back in 2015-2017. Every single one of them came back with varying reports of AI generation, even though we wrote them in high school before ChatGPT even was a thing.",comment,17

One of my essays last semester, I wrote the whole thing myself - didn’t even use chatGPT for brainstorming - not a single tool. Got flagged for ""AI likelihood"" because apparently, my thesis sounded too organized or something. I asked my prof, and they said unless whole paragraphs hit high percentages or it reads obviously generic, it doesn’t count as plagiarism, just ""review material."" If you got flagged on just a few sentences like citations or regular intros, I wouldn’t stress.

Most professors are looking for copy-paste or fully AI written stuff, not someone who improved clarity or sounded competent haha. If you want an extra check before Turnitin, AIDetectPlus and Copyleaks tend to show you \*which\* sentences may be triggering detectors, and sometimes the explanations help figure out what's causing false positives. Do you know what specific detector you used before Turnitin? And did you notice if complex words or sentence structure got you more flags? Curious what triggers it for you, it’s so random sometimes.",comment,3

Don't worry about AI detectors if you wrote it all on your own make sure to keep the version history of the document as a proof.

If you did use AI even for grammar or just rewording some portions make sure to run them through a good humanizer like:  AI-text-humanizer com before submission.",comment,1

Many journals don't even require you to declare it if this is all you used AI for in a paper you submit.

As a TA, I don't give a rat's ass if my students use AI. If they tried to get it to do the thinking for them, the assignment rubrics themselves typically catch it, and even when they don't, the fact that the student doesn't actually understand the material will eventually catch up to them in one way or another. 

Even if there is some blatant sign that a student used AI on an assignment, I'm still only going to grade on content unless specifically instructed otherwise because for all I know they just used it to copyedit an answer they worked out themselves. Frankly, a lot of the time this scenario means that my job is easier; say whatever else you want about ChatGPT, but don't tell me its outputs aren't *legible*, which is more than I can say about many students and even some faculty.

We should be treating it like many journals do: if you use AI in your submission, you take on full responsibility for what you've submitted. If your use of AI screws you, tough shit, you used it wrong. If it doesn't, good job, you did it right or you got lucky. It's really your problem, not mine.

Ideally there should be courses or modules or something to guide students on how to properly leverage AI tools, and I imagine those are coming soon. What UofT is doing in the meantime seems like more of its typical gatekeeping behaviour so that it can look cOmPeTiTiVe.",comment,1
