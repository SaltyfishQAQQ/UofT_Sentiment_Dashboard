What the hell is going on with New College residence quality control??,Trumpsbacka,1ngfcrd,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ngfcrd/what_the_hell_is_going_on_with_new_college/,1757816089.0,"Was just sitting at my desk studying and the back of my chair literally flew off. I hit my lower back and neck seriously. It took me a full minute to get up, and I found out that the screw connecting the back and the seat was missing.

Now my neck and lower back hurt like hell and I feel dizzy.  
Super pissed. They gave me¬†inside-out curtains¬†and a¬†broken drawer¬†when i moved in, and now this? This is my fourth year living in New College and they didn't do any move in check for me now.

Well done, New College.

Thats not something you want to risk. (Your don should be able to help) Then on Monday speak to a residence advisor about the state of your room,comment,100
