Can I survive engineering at U of T without a laptop?,LostJellyfish81,1mwrg4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1mwrg4k/can_i_survive_engineering_at_u_of_t_without_a/,1755820908.0,"Hey everyone,

I’m starting my engineering degree at U of T, but here’s the thing: I don’t have a laptop and can’t afford one right now. I know laptops make things way easier for coding, CAD, simulations, and note taking, but I’ve heard U of T has solid computer labs and other resources.

Has anyone managed to get through engineering relying mostly on campus labs, borrowing, or other workarounds? How manageable is it, really? Would it seriously affect my workload or grades?

Any tips, advice, or survival stories would be super appreciated. Thanks!",submission,34

Beyond just schoolwork, not owning a computing device other than your phone will probably be very annoying (are you gonna store your personal financial documents on a school computer?) Consider getting a part time job or heck, take a week off school and do some labor work.

Also I wouldn’t plan to survive all four years without one…if you do well in first year and get a good summer internship, you might have enough cash to get a laptop then (or even beg your employer to keep the company laptop). At the very least, work over the upcoming reading week and winter break.",comment,19

long answer: computer labs and the library aren't always available. There are always tons of people waiting to use a computer so it could take a long time before you are able to use one. 

It would be especially hard with tight deadlines for an assignment or smth. Just bite the bullet and get a small laptop that's easy to carry, it'll be worth it.",comment,1

Whether that’s a laptop is up to you. My setup is a custom-built desktop at home for coding, CAD, sims, etc., and an iPad with apple pencil for day-to-day notetaking, assignments, and homework, and then if I needed to do heavy duty work on campus, either using the computer labs or remote-accessing my desktop through my ipad.

(the ipad meta is unreal for notetaking, basically everyone in my program had transitioned to ipad or other tablets for notes by end of 3rd year. I think there was only one or 2 people who still took pen and paper notes).

I do have an old laptop that would probably work that I would sell you for a few hundred if you wanted it, but unfortunately I’m not in Toronto until probably Thanksgiving.",comment,0
