They will suddenly become your best friends and invite you to ""*Bible studies*” that quickly become them teaching you’re not a christian.

Their are many great christian groups on campus and across the GTA. Choose slowly, biblically and wisely. Find out their history and practices.

*If any group is hiding their churches actual name, this is not normal at all*

*Please name the group that has approached you.* ",submission,400

They presented themselves as a student club and I was invited by someone I met in a class. They turned out to be a church in Korea Town and it took them a really long time to mention they had a prophet who was some guy in the US. 

I thought it was going to be like intellectual theological debate and a way to meet people with diverse sets of beliefs! And after I'd been to two I was too polite to say I didn't want to go to any more... If anyone here needs to be told this, YOU ARE ALLOWED TO SAY ""NO""!",comment,100

Believe they’re calling themselves Restored Church Toronto now. 

Usually I wouldn’t have bothered but they caught me the week after a close family member passed. I’m exactly like all of you where rationally I’d be like “who would go to a random Bible group” but these groups work best on people caught at bad times, so there I was. 

Honestly, they do a great job of appearing dynamic, modern, and engaging. The whole goal is to get you “baptized”. Lots of love bombing and mutual “confessing of sins” along the way so you feel bonded to those mentoring you. The first service I went to, one of the senior female members got my number and continued to text trying to convince me to come back until I blocked her. Discretely implied that you will devote all spare time and money to the church. You are encouraged to date within the church or get your partner converted. Nothing past hugs (not too long though) with the opposite sex until marriage. You can take on advanced leadership roles by paying money for scam courses. I am very thankful I never got baptized. 

Again, easy to be like “who tf would entertain this” but it’s gradual and subtle and like I said, it works if you’re already struggling. 

I’ve seen them at York and George Brown, too. There’s now Google results calling them out but when it happened to me, there was nothing as it was pretty new. Figured I’d add my 2 cents to the search results lol.",comment,51

Makes sense as my sister’s roommate in university was an orthodox Jewish girl who took her to dinners at the synagogue all the time. My sister said the dinners were so fun and delicious and their whole friend group would go. My sister is still friends with her now that they are both in their 30s and went to her orthodox wedding.
