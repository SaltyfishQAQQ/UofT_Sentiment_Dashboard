Yes, I am angry; I literally searched for them at each floor with only tampons (not going for the risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome).

We'll have to find them at other locations on-campus. **But hopefully this is a heads up to folks that need them to carry one when going to the library**. 😢

I don't know when they'll restock them. Caretaking services does not have them in their maintenance/restock carts.",submission,86

Also in the comments the girls are complaining on how it’s painful because they can’t get them in the right way. 

The most articles on tampons are also on how to out them in, so I guess it’s fairly common for girls to get them the wrong way, or to have them stuck, or to need a ride to E.R because the white string fall out. 

I have a girlfriend and she never uses them for some of those reasons, she prefers to use toilet paper if she really has no other options.

It can cause a lot of pain and discomfort for people with medical conditions. I myself wasn’t comfortable with them for years and exclusively wore pads before

Plus most people literally can’t use tampons if they’re at the last few days of their period. If there’s not enough blood to fill one, your chances of TSS are HIGHLY increased. Removal of dry tampons can also cause micro-tears which aren’t good for obvious reasons

I’m not gonna bother giving any more points because you sound like someone who doesn’t menstruate so you shouldn’t even be giving your opinion lmfao

Also people have died from TSS. There’s nothing wrong with someone being uncomfortable with taking that risk. But it seems you never had to consider that risk for yourself :)",comment,8
