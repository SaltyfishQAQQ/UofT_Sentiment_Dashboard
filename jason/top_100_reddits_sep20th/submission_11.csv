Funding is being cancelled because the federal administration thinks it's funny to cancel it. The President is directly interfering with specific institutions for his own ideological bent. And beyond universities, what the current President is doing is not normal. It's not healthy for a society either. Let's all be grateful that we've got the academic freedoms to pursue what we wish here in Canada. I say all this, as someone who grew up believing in our international friend 😢 We are bystanders, watching history repeat itself. I'm 29 years old.

They still have almost all the best universities in the world and their programs, classes, professors, amenities, services and infrastructure isn’t affected, especially the Ivey leagues with whom the president had the most clash with. They’re still far richer than any other university and have hundreds of millions in funding per year. 

And almost all top 50 universities worldwide are in the US. I’m sure they’d be fine and it’s not the end of the world. This presidents term will end in 3.5 years and it’s business as usual. Even now the students are not feeling the effect as much as you claim. Universities don’t just change overnight just cuz the man in the Oval Office said so.

And this fear-mongering other people engage in, in this comment section, has no place here. UofT is a private institution and by default the entire academic apparatus, institutions and the whole system in Canada is fundamentally different. 

And politics in Canada is never as polarized and extreme as the US. Our Conservative Party looks liberal compared to their Republican counterparts. Canada was never affected by extremities or polarizing ideologies, and bipartisan party politics. 

Universities everywhere are by default a liberal institution, even in countries like Iran(my home country) they’re a liberal institution and clash with the government. 

Sometimes this liberal ideology does go to extremes with that ideology. But in a free society we can all agree to disagree so long as we engage in civil discourse, stay respectful and don’t harm one another or infringe on another’s rights and freedoms. And universities must champion free speech as much as possible.",comment,-9

I live in the US.  My son has dual citizenship and we sent him to Canada to start school this fall at UoT.  Students here are absolutely feeling *it*.  Many programs that people applied to, were accepted to, accepted offers, and then rejected other offers...had the rugs pulled out from underneath them when those programs were pulled due to funding issues.  Tuition jumped again and the ability to pay back loans became even harder (unless you decide to join ICE).  The restrictions on student loans became even tighter.  Gun violence on campus is a ever present threat (UC Boulder, where I live, was locked down just yesterday for a weapon on campus).

A friend of mine said she dropped her daughter off at Univ of Arizona last week and noted that our old dorm was completely closed due to lack of demand for student housing.  The headlines do not communicate all that is happening on the ground and reported in local news.

Merit aid is almost non existent unless you are an athlete.  Need based aid is only offered to low income households even though the tuition is SO high that even high income households can't actually afford it.  We are comfortable and make good money, but who the heck has $40,$60,$90k PER YEAR to pay for their child's tuition (and that doesn't include housing or food!) Boulder is $40k, col. School of Mines is $60k, Yale is $92k (these are the financial info packets I personally saw this year and none of these totals include housing).

Again I’m not saying these aren’t happening, but the universities still attract students and still hold on to their rankings. 

My entire point was that It’s not the chaos the media portrays it to be. It’s still bad but the US is still a free society and democracy and there’s checks and balances on everything. And all this will pass, it’s not permanent. And that the apparent threats and extreme sentiments won’t influence Canada or Canadian universities because Canada and US are quite different politically, socially and the political and cutler landscape and foundation is inherently different. 

Canada is deeply multicultural, prone to change and much more liberal as a society and country. The US is a melting pot, relies on assimilation and is dominated by polarizing and extreme bi partisan politics on the verge of tribalism. 


You mentioned the example of merit aid and loans and used Yale as an example which is a flawed example. You’re using a top 5 ranking US university, an ivy league institution, and using that to justify your claims on the hundreds of universities across the US. 

I am not condoning any of this. Just pointing out facts. For instance where’s the statistics on restrictions on higher student loans or gun higher gun violence on “campuses”? 

Just because one incident happened here or there it doesn’t mean it’s an overall increase in that metric. 

Just because there’s construction and traffic on point X, Y and Z in the city, it doesn’t mean the city is drowned in construction and traffic…See how that logic is flawed? 

This is because…..drum role please 






Correlation doesn’t equal causation. 









And it’s just sad that instead of having a civil discussion here people get emotional and just downvote merely because my views don’t conform with their worldview. 

We can still disagree or dicsusss things and have opposing views. That’s literally the foundation of what a university is. Asking questions, questioning the narrative and Socratic dialogue to reach a common understanding.",comment,-4

Yale ranks higher as an overall school, but for the program my son is in... Toronto ranks higher).  My son received financial breakdowns of the two state schools because he was accepted to both.  His best friend got one from Yale that he shared with us.  

Go read the subreddit 'student loans'.  The issue with tuition, loans, etc is unfortunately the norm for a majority of students.  Most do not have a 529 that is funded well enough to cover tuition for 4 years or they don't have one at all and unless you are earning a million or more every year, most families cannot afford to pay out what can easily amount to $250k-$500k for their kids' tuition until graduation.  This is particularly true when you look at the fact that many families have multiple children.

The biggest issue I see from my perspective right now (aside from money) is that many programs were cut at many schools last spring.  I know Boulder had to cut several (programs that had to do with climate studies, cancer research, and farming solutions) because funding was cut to one area and that area had multiple programs that depended on it.  Trump also cut NOAA funding ($30M and 1$1.5B respectively).  Both of these affect programs at Boulder and honestly... NOAA currently provides key weather information and monitors solar flares for both the US and Canada (and the world).  We'll see how that goes in 2026 when the hammer officially drops.  

Point being, if you enter a program at Boulder and many other public universities right now and Trump decides to cut more here and more there, your program could vaporize in the middle of earning your degree.  What do you do when you're two years into your program and Trump decides for more cuts and you are midway into a program that doesn't exist anymore.  It's not fear mongering considering it already happened.  

But go back for minute.. you talked about all these high ranking schools in the US.. those would be schools like Yale (which you have decided to treat as an outlier now🤷🏻‍♀️) so this does matter.  But either way, merit aid is practically non existent right now unless you choose a low ranked school that is practically begging for you to attend.  My son was Valedictorian, graduated with a lot of fancy credentials attached to his name, etc.  Boulder gave $4k for general merit aid which is the max they give to anyone and then $1,000 for being ranked 1st at his school in Colorado (only available for Colorado students).  Mines gave nothing.  Yale and other ivies do not do merit aid at all and if you earn above $300k, you qualify for no need based aid at all.  Seriously... go read 'student loans'.  And yes, I personally know plenty of people who ended up in the same boat.  My niece took more than 10 years to pay her loans and she AGGRESSIVELY paid.  She's a nurse and has been out of school for 15 years now.  It's gotten much worse in those years.

Keep in mind that Trump took office last January.  This will be the first year where those cuts are going to be felt.  I simply would not trust being able to finish a degree in the US for right now whether it's because the program disappears, you can't afford tuition, the new loan caps mean you can't even borrow the money needed to cover tuition if you wanted to, or ICE comes for you (if you are brown or an international student) or ICE comes for your professors🤷🏻‍♀️.  

Students will continue to graduate for the next 4 years... some of them anyway.  It's risky though.  My son had an option that not a lot of American students have because he has dual citizenship and I am grateful for it.  He was accepted at 4 Canadian universities and he researched his options and this was the best fit and because he has domestic tuition, I mean... he will pay less than it costs to attend a community college in the US.  So yeah, we feel very lucky to have that option.",comment,2

I only have two kids, but they split time between 3 campuses for classes.  UC Boulder sent one out last week probably because we are still on their email list.  About 10 years ago, the elementary school they attended had a shooting where one child died and several others were injured (STEM Highlands Ranch).
