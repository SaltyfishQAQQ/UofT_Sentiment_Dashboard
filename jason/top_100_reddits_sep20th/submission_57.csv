I'm in cog sci and maybe ppl are like this because they don't want friends as competition or they don't want people stealing notes or whatever but I really don't imagine it to be competitive as lifesci or engineering (to my knowledge) so I'm just generally confused why people detest making at least class friends. I think I'm a bit of an introvert but I try to least make an effort to talk to people in class and try to grab their social. how the hell do people make friends here??? this is so sad coming from a fourth year but I haven't made one friend that's stuck with me throughout my years here. you'll meet nice people that stick around for the class you share but basically disappear when the semester's done. some don't vibe and I get that but with people you thought had a genuine friendship with they leave too lol. I would compliment something someone has as a convo started and they go ""thanks üòê"" and then stick their head so far up their butt. no one is friendly here and it actually sucks not having a genuine connection with people and have friends from uni...",submission,57

U of T can feel like a hard place to make lasting connections, especially when people are so focused on academics. One thing that‚Äôs helped me (and friends I know) is checking out the free programming at Hart House. A lot of it is really low-pressure, and you‚Äôll find people from all different departments just hanging out, trying something new and actually WANTING to make friends. The vibe is more about community than competition, which makes it easier to meet people outside of your classes.",comment,9

Even if someone does initiate, there's no attempt to follow-up and strengthen the connection further. 

As an adult, friendship requires constant active effort from all parties. You're not a kid anymore where you can just stumble into friendship.",comment,8

I am very much a yapper and small talker but it feels sort of forbidden to make friends. I know there's so much cliche responses like go to clubs but for me as a commuter it's nearly impossible if I'm not living on campus.",comment,1

The pandemic + this cohort spending a good chunk of their formative years online definitely had an impact. 

Even if your social skills didn't atrophy during this time you're dealing with a bunch of people who have, which basically makes the weird social vibe the norm.",comment,5
