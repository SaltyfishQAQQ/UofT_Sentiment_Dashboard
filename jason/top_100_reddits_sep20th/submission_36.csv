The horrifying Pikachu mascot that got arrested by campus security last year has a meet and greet on Tuesday??,WeaknessAvailable697,1n6m1te,https://i.redd.it/kwlmfjplnrmf1.jpeg,1756825670.0,"I think we all remember last year when this terrifying Temu ass Pikachu busted into classrooms and rode a creepy four-person bike around campus for a week. It was all part of a fundraising campaign by Bikechain, the UTSG non-profit bike repair centre.

Apparently Tweakachu is now making his return as part of a Back To School Bike Parade hosted by Bikechain. They're inviting people to ride with them around campus to celebrate back to school and meet other cyclists.

The parade is Tuesday September 9, and starts at 3 PM at Bikechain.
