i'm a 4th year in a specialist program and got into a half credit of 400 levels courses,The_professor053,1nhlofy,https://i.redd.it/wmjia3xgxbpf1.jpeg,1757942453.0,"i'm in CSB and because i was given a late enrollment time (12pm), and because the department doesn't have enough spaces in its seminars for the number of 4th year students, i tried to enrol in seven 400 level courses and only got into one. 

this is insane. why would you not have enough seats for students in the program?? the department said there's nothing they're willing to do because i can meet my grad requirements by filling up on lower year courses.

i should have done MGY instead",submission,48

The class sizes are kept small so students can really engage with each other and the instructor. If everyone signed up for 7, it would be like lower year courses.",comment,-6
