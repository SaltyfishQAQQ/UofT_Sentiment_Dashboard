Ride bikes despite (from what Iâ€™ve heard) high bike theft? Share bikes risking no docks? Skateboards scooters etc or are we rawdogging it with legs and sprinting? Or maybe just embrace chronic lateness? ",submission,43

You are bound to be late if you are running from John Danielâ€™s to OISE or Myhal to Northrop often. It is what it is.

If you are late to a tutorial, TA are most likely permissive of your lateness as long as itâ€™s in reasonable time and you donâ€™t disrupt anything. If you are late to a crowded lecture, nobody cares at all. 

Riding your own bike is fine, I donâ€™t think thefts are that rampant when campus is full of people commuting, too big of a risk. They love striking bikes left at the spot for long in night or early morning instead. BikeShare is always full and often still far from my class between dock so I choose not to take it. Winter especially is not good for biking, too slippery and cold, walking is much more preferable.",comment,1
