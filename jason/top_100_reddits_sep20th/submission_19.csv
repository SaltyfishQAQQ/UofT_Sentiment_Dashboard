WHY DOES NO ONE TALK IN CLASSES | YA'LL HAVE IMMUNITY??,Wise-Ebb2784,1nhz0ps,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nhz0ps/why_does_no_one_talk_in_classes_yall_have_immunity/,1757972430.0,"most antisocial school on the planet. are ya'll immune to socializing? i'm a pretty social and bubbly person, and i totally understand if it doesn't come naturally to you but also...it didn't come naturally to me either. i was PAINFULLY shy and quiet as a kid. it takes a \*little\* bit of stepping out of your comfort zone and inconveniencing slightly for a better reward in the future.

i've REALLY tried to connect with people at Uoft st. george in a variety of classes -- african/carribbean courses, english, chemistry, marketing, you name it. but it RARELY goes anywhere. most people seem to just wanna stay quiet the entire lecture.

and oh my GOD college guys are ya'll really this scared to talk to women üò≠ every guy i meet is silent or no offense boring at first and it takes ME opening up with confidence and making people laugh for them to open up.

so many people stare at me but almost no one makes conversation until i do :( (except shoutout to that one girl that was confident enough to approach at robarts!!)

like Uofters initiate a little bit, but when it comes to CONSISTENTLY reaching out and initiating...goes nowhere. every time i come to school now i leave drained

must be an introvert's heaven :(

EDIT: i am SO surprised this post resonated with many people ? i thought i was gonna get downvoted into oblivion for saying writing thoughts out loud üò≠",submission,190

Who cares if u always have to go up to them, just do it, enjoy your life and go out of ur way to make friends. I honestly don‚Äôt have much trouble making atleast 1 friend a class (this is not to brag but if I can, anyone can). Just talking to your classmates isn‚Äôt enough. Say something to them, get their contact, ask them to go grab a bite or something. If your school life isn‚Äôt going the way you want, then make it go the way you want. I think the reason people think they can‚Äôt make friendships even tho they ‚Äútalk to people‚Äù is precisely because just talking to people isn‚Äôt enough. It‚Äôs not like u speak to someone and then a friendship organically forms (ofc sometimes this does happen but as you know, it happens rarely).

UofT is a big campus that's integrated within the surrounding city - there's pros and cons to that as you could run into anyone, though you would likely run into only people that's in your class or cohort. A good portion of the students just want to focus on school (regardless of their motivations ie. Personal or family obligation). A number of males also do not approach females (especially randomly) for fear of being seen as a creep at best or predator at worse.

In my entire first degree I never spoke up once in my classes even with participation being 20%, and oftentimes got 60s or 70s in classes because of it (zoom university comments section helped a lot when it came that time). 

Now, in my second bachelors, i am the biggest yapper in class so much so that my classmates are sick of me. They don‚Äôt actually know my back story and how much energy and time it took to gain the courage for me to speak at all, so they think I‚Äôm just annoyingly knowledgeable lol. But I‚Äôd rather be seen as annoying over never speaking. I‚Äôve now drastically changed my perception of myself because I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúhard things‚Äù. Myself from 5 years ago would not recognize me today, and for that I‚Äôm proud.
