They will be a group of two or more ppl just hanging out in a changing room, waiting to steal cash from your wallet when you take your off your eyes, even for 10 seconds.

Also some guys would walk into your room on a moving day because that is when ppl leave their door unlocked and moving stuff. If they see a wallet or a phone on a table they would grab it. If they ran into you they would just say, “Sorry, I thought this was my room.” And you will never see this person again throughout the semester.

Also don’t hang your jacket on a library chair, with your valuables, they will pickpocket you.

I know this from firsthand and nobody will help you.

Enjoy your new semester!",submission,164

It’s so easy to forget the campus is not in fact some secluded territory but rather in the middle of downtown. Unfortunately many people view students as easy targets - make sure you take care of your belongings :)),comment,18

I’m staying in a double room in my res. I was coming back to my room after having a lunch, while my roommate was sleeping inside, so I left it unlocked. I saw this girl walking through the hallway and specifically targeting my room at the end of the hallway. She opened the door, then closed it immediately. I don’t know if that was due to she saw my friend fall asleep, heared my footsteps (I technically “followed” her because I was also going to my room), or she was just genuinely forgot her room. She noticed me and saying “I’m sorry” many times. I was thinking that it is very unlikely to be unsure about your room position while confidently opening a door, the feeling should be different. I wasn’t taking it seriously, but reading this discussion makes me concern about it.",comment,23

If she is on the same floor, you should see her in an elevator or events organized by the floor don. If not, most likely she is a thief, but they normally target moving-in days.",comment,4
