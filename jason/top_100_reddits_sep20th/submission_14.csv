The UofT team and Daniels Corporation, who partnered together on this condo, should have known well in advance that they were not going to complete construction in time before move-in. Calling this a ""last-minute delay"" is a blatant lie.

1. I heard that I have to hope that the construction office accepts my packages and keep them safe in there, then I should be able to get them back when I move in to Oak House. However, if they don't, then theres nothing that the Oak House office can do. Which is pretty annoying and I don't know what I can do after that tbh.

2. I got a shared suite with a roommate, I have a shared living room and a washroom. It‚Äôs not a bad option but it‚Äôs just not what I got assigned for the Oak House.

Im not sure if everyone who got Parkside for the temporary residence ended up coming into a shared suite, but it would be tragic if it‚Äôs not ur thing.",comment,5
