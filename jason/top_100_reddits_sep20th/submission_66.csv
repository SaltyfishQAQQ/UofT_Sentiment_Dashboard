No need to kiss ass or read their books or do research before hand. Just go to a prof whoâ€™s work or ethic your genuinely interested in and talk! You could even talk about assignments if you feel more comfortable doing that! Ask them about their work do you can learn more, ask them how they got to their current position, ask them if they have any tips for how you could do better in class. (Obviously keep it relevant to your class or your prof or academia in general, theyâ€™re your prof not your friend!)",comment,41

The prof will be very familiar with you by the end of the term. Theyâ€™ll be happy to write a reference letter. Any prof who isnâ€™t an asshole will be happy to write reference letters. 

If you had any prof for more than one class, including a 300 of 400 level course, theyâ€™ll know you well enough. 

And youâ€™d be surprised by how well they know you just by answering/asking questions in class, and from marking your work.",comment,12

However, because they don't know you personally, the ref letter will likely be pretty basic. This semester, try going to office hours, asking about course material, asking about their research/career journey, and see if you can relate it back to yourself and why you want to go to grad school, and then lead it into a convo about ref letters.",comment,3
