Asked to leave at cafeteria because I have a waterbottle on my bag,TianYiBlue,1n6zfld,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n6zfld/asked_to_leave_at_cafeteria_because_i_have_a/,1756856594.0,"Today while eating at new college dining room, I am issued a ""final warning"" to leave (this is my first time here) because I carried a backpack with a waterbottle while I was eating there. An lady approached and shot really loud at me to issue a final warning. Everyone turned their head to look. I felt really bad and embrased. She said waterbottle was not allowed in the dining hall, not even on backpacks. When asked what should I do with this she immediately shoted ""don't bring it or whatever"". Considering I don't live here, this is basically equivalent to not comming back again. I asked her if there is a list or rules/policy and she said it's being printed. It felt really weird being issued a ""final warning"" given that there is not even written policy. After issuing it to me she approached a girl with coffee from outside who looled like she was about to cry.

Is there a source of complaint I can submit for these kind of non inclusive and offensive behaviour from a campus stuff?",submission,474

That is odd. I‚Äôd go there again and just put the water bottle inside my backpack. OR carry it conspicuously and stand your ground. I kind of feel like going there and bringing my own food to see what happens üòÇ. UofT is into environmental stewardship‚Ä¶.an anti water bottle policy goes against that. I highly doubt there is any policy against bringing water bottles. I would suspect it‚Äôs just this staff member.,comment,74

If no water bottle is allowed, how are you suppose to get something to drink during the meal? More importantly what's the rational behind that decision?

You have to use their papper cups? Or forced to buy drinks? What happened to UofT sustainability effort? I remember back in my days they don't sell water bottles cuz they try to promote having your own water bottle and have refills stations everywhere.

Better email the dean of students for that, and probably cc sustainability department as well",comment,34

I would start by writing a complaint to food services department:

Do not allow this incident to put you down. And a word of advice, be nice, everywhere, but firm enough to not allow anyone to treat you like that. I would not yell back, but would definitely speak strongly and politely telling her that I did not know and missed the sign, and that she cannot yell at me like that. 

File the complaint, and no you did not do anything wrong with carrying a water-bottle, and you shouldn‚Äôt be ashamed.

I was beyond confused and so I told them I do not have that and asked how I can get the eco container anyways (like would I hv to pay extra or smth, I was willing.) they stood there and proceeded to yell at me for abt 10 minutes while arguing amongst themselves (three of them) abt whether or not I should get the eco container and if they charged me right.

The whole New College Dining Hall is kind of sad. They have crazy meal plan costs but you can't even restock your supplies in peace. (I was using the water dispenser to fill up my water bottle.)

Meanwhile there is a line at the entrance because the cashier has to tap a button on a touch screen before the next person can tap their card.
