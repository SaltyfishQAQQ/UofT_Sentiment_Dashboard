Being financially unstable at UofT and other universities,Square-Magazine-1344,1nafv68,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nafv68/being_financially_unstable_at_uoft_and_other/,1757206477.0,"Hello, I dont mean to offend anyone with this post, pls dont take it that way. I just feel kind of alone right now and wanted to yell into a void.

Im going into my fourth year. My parents worked very hard to be able to make it in this country and give me the opportunities ive been given. There have been lots of sacrifices along the way. I saw that and worked super hard to get into u of t, and I was so excited.

When i left (originally from winnipeg) home, it was brutal, but I was kind of expecting it. My parents told me before I left that if i left, they couldnt afford to pay u of t tuition or any living accommodation (other than home). I understood, we were never wealthy or ""well off"" and i wanted them to save up because theyre getting older, and decided to pursue u of t on my own.

For the last three years, i have worked my tail off covering food, rent, my phone, utilities, tuition, and anything else necessary. I take out loans to pay for school and some living expenses but not all of them, so to make up for the gap, i work. A LOT. it doesnt matter if im tired, or sad, or exhausted, i cant stop. Ive adapted to this over the years, and it gets easier the more i do it (although still tough).

And hey, i chose to be here and its my responsibility, but sometimes it gets lonely. I wont say everyone because i would be generalizing way too much, but every person i have met at this school over the last four years is better off than i am, and yk what good for them! I really am happy for them. But it eats away at me. My friends and people i know (even at other unis in the GTA) get housing/food/tuition/living expenses/credit cards/hobbies paid by their parents. They can play sports and pursue hobbies, be part of clubs and activities (that all cost money), and as much as id love that, i cant afford that. Sometimes people will say things that are out of touch, or when they try to sympathize its not the same because they dont quite understand.

 I want to be clear: i dont hate them or anything like that. We all live different realities, and thats okay. You cant be upset at people because of things like this. Everyone has their own, VALID struggles, no matter what it is. But it does get to me at times. It feels heavy and i feel alone. More doors open for them and they get the experience they want because theyre in a better financial position. I love u of t and dont regret my choice, Its just tough sometimes.

PS: Im aware that there are perople out there in worse positions than me, this is just my experience.

Edit: thank you everyone for your encouragement and kind words:)",submission,192

It does hurt sometimes that I can’t afford the same luxuries as people around me (summer abroads, fashion, trips, lots of eating out), I remind myself that I’m getting to learn skills that a lot of people don’t have! The shock friends of mine got when they first started internships was funny to me since I’ve been accustomed to working life.  I’m also grateful I don’t have any credit card debt and am able to support me and my cat :) a lot of students with financial support still have debt and things because they haven’t learned budgeting yet

it also helps that I’ve worked odd jobs like cleaning houses that make decent money and have worked hard at student jobs to get experience and increase my wages 

Sorry for the really long text the TLDR is that financially independent students exist and we are thriving in our own ways! Also if you haven’t please look into contacting your registrar and the UTSU to apply for financial aid. DMs are always open!",comment,14

I also went to U of T from 2020 to 2024, and while my upbringing was different at the time, I lost my parents young and ended up homeless at 18, as well as few times after so I had to figure things out on my own. I have been on ODSP since 2015 because of chronic health issues and disabilities, and I am definitely not well off. Over the years I worked multiple jobs, dealt with OSAP denials, and covered rent, tuition, and living expenses. On top of that, I navigated grief, addiction, mental health challenges, trauma, and even the legal system as a victim. It has been exhausting at times and there were moments I did not think I could keep going.

There are so many others in similar situations even if it is not visible on the surface. For example , one  of my mentors and close friends went to U of T while homeless and in the child welfare system. You can not always see what someone is going through just by looking at them or their circumstances. It can be so easy to compare yourself to peers who have parents covering rent, tuition, hobbies, or trips. That comparison can eat away at you but it really is the thief of joy.

What you are building, the resilience, independence, and ability to navigate challenges, is invaluable. Those experiences will shape you in ways that go beyond grades or extracurriculars. You are doing amazing even if it does not always feel like it. There are so many people hustling like you, quietly pushing through hardships, and your effort and perseverance matter more than you know.",comment,7

I was estranged from both of my parents right before I started first year. The youth shelter I was living in helped me with minimum payment because OSAP didn’t know how to deal with estrangement at the time and I struggled my way through my first year. Working part time and dealing with so much deep seated mental health. The over working was easier because it kept me distracted. I burned out by mid 2nd year and that is finally when I went to my college registrars office. 

My college registrars office got right into action once they learned of my family situation and having no family support. By the end of my schooling I received $50k total in grants just from UofT/ my college. My last year they provided the most at one time by giving me a $16k grant to get through my last semester of school. 

I admire all your hard work, and hear you that it’s just exhausting.. I hope you can secure some extra grants. If there is unmet need UofT will help you! Best of luck this year ❤️ finish strong",comment,3

I wanted to add to this but with an international student POV, since I’m in a situation very similar to yours.

I’m entering my second year now, looking to graduate in 2028. I feel ya, juggling everything on your plate trying to get by. I’m on a full-course load while working three 8-hour shifts every week just to pay for my living expenses. My dad paid for my first and second year tuition with his life savings, and I have to fend for myself come next year since he can no longer financially support me. 

My family isn’t well off, like, at all. For my particular situation; what really makes it much more tough for me is paying international tuition.

To a certain extent I get why we international students pay more. The university should prioritize people from/living here. What really grapples my nerves is paying not double or triple, but TEN times what domestic students pay. But that’s beside the point.

I’ve been trying to get a line of credit to support my tuition for the remaining two years at UofT (not looking good so far since I’m not Canadian). My dad is also trying to get a loan from back home, though it also seems quite bleak. 

Yeah… maybe it wasn’t the best idea for me to go to UofT as someone who isn’t an international student loaded with their parents’ money (I joke with my friends that I’m probably the poorest int. student at UofT).

But it really is scary, right now I don’t even know if I can stay til fourth year or if I have to pause my studies. 

Wishing you a great final year! A degree from UofT isn’t one from any random place afterall, so I’m sure you’ll succeed in whatever career you choose.",comment,2

I've never been in your situation but I can imagine how difficult it is so I'm truly sorry. About internation tuition - Canadian student tuition is subsidized through tax dollars via provincial (and some federal) payments, which is why international students pay more. I was curious how much funding so I asked chat GPT (ie. Don't hold me to these numbers...) and it said about $30k. So then I was curious how much standard tuition is at UofT (I'm a long ago alumn) and it said $6500 vs.$55k. So if we add the funding and domestic tuition together, you're roughly overpaying by $20k-25k. Of course, these numbers can vary greatly by program and institution.. 

So you're paying about 3x more tuition than domestic students, so still not good but not quite as awful as it appears on the surface if you're just comparing tuition bills. I'm sorry you have to compensate for our lack of funding/willingness to increase domestic tuition. 

That all said, it is definitely an issue in Canada in terms of overcharging and over enrolling international students and the government cracked down on that a year or so ago by reducing study permits by 35% overall and introducing international student caps at each institution. UofTs cap didn't change but some other places went down by 50% E.g. Conestoga college.",comment,2

This world (especially the corporate influence that has spread everywhere) tells people not to be emotional, not to feel, not to have thoughts, feelings, and that is extremely damaging. Don't do that to yourself.

If you want to cry? Do it. If you want to laugh? Go nuts. If you want to spend 6 hours making a meal that goes horribly wrong? Laugh because it's one more experience and adventure under your belt.

Money isn't everything, and I say that as someone in business and finance and working for/with people who would sell their mothers to Satan for a discount/praise. And wealth management is not just in funds but time, effort and so much more.

Keep going and if you need to have a breakdown, have at it. Anyone who tells you that they don't have breakdowns are either a liar or so emotionally and intellectually damaged that they aren't worth listening to (and that goes from profs to parents to bosses to your SO to everyone else in the world).

First they take income tax (easily 20-40%), then lot of canadian pension plan money (which god knows if we will even see 40 years down the line LOL), then each time we buy something, we pay 13% on each item, then property taxes are easily in thousands as well, unless ur renting in which case its alr ggs with more than 40%+ of ur paycheck likely going to that with no ROI either. 

Tbh situation in canada is kind of bleak for young canadians. It feels like government takes so much but provides so little, and is allergic to good policies.

It is an actual blessing that by some last grace of god our tuition fees are at least frozen. If they unfreeze that even im not even sure what i would be paying.
