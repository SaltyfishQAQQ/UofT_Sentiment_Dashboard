1. She said shooting is too good for _some_ of you fascists. If you use a shred of good faith you can see that she's talking about people like Kirk who do a lot of damage. Not everyone who happens to hold fascist beliefs
2. She said shooting is _too good_ for some of you fascists. This phrasing is _regularly_ used to mean that you'd prefer that they get arrested, charged, and punished for their actions 
3. Even if you assume she means some fascists should be shot, that's not that much of an out there opinion and nor is it incitement to violence. It's merely an expression of support towards one violent act in very specific circumstances",comment,2
