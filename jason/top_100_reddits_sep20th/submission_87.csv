I HATE IT SO MUCHHH I almost failed MAT137 last year because of this format, I feel like (at least for me) it just encourages skipping lectures and falling behind on content. And all of the pre-lecture videos ARE JUST LECTURE VIDEOS MADE FROM DURING COVID so it's not even the same professor as the one currentlyyy",submission,30

Itâ€™s like whatâ€™s the point of having lecture if we are just solving practice problems.. Have you tried finding study buddy or groups? I joined a study circle last semester on fable and that helped me much more than this type of lectures,comment,1
