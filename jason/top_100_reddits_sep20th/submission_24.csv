I know there are others out there who feel the same. It's a disconcerting feeling that your last year might be too late to catch up on what you've missed. There are still clubs and events to go to, but I'm sure many people feel like they will just be meeting people with already established friend groups.

It would be so cool if there was a club for people who missed out on uni life thus far to experience it together our last year! We can go to all the events and things we missed and connect with people in the same situation, and hopefully make some great friendships!",submission,163

There should be a club like that for upper years, year 3 and up, or it should have an age range. Let‚Äôs create it. 

Although I doubt UTSU would allow a club with an age selection and they‚Äôd state it‚Äôs ‚Äúdiscriminatory‚Äù and not ‚Äúinclusive lol‚Äù. 


Don‚Äôt mean to be that guy but let‚Äôs not dwell on the past. I‚Äôm a 7th year cuz I got academically suspended at the end of my second year (failed 3 classes in first year) and took another year off myself to work and rearrange my priorities and change my life around. 

Always remember: 


The past is in the past, and it‚Äôs none of our concern. 


Don‚Äôt be chained and bound by the regrets of the past my friend. After all, the only thing you can do is learn from the past, and try to minimkze failures, mistakes and regrets. You gotta put it behind you and move on, and keep going. 

It‚Äôs not too late to do all the things you missed out on. Extracurrials? Student clubs? Parties? Sports? Friends? Yes all those are great things, but you can still do them after university if you missed out during your university years. 

And we can still do those things in our last year‚Ä¶

But I do feel you and I experienced exactly the same thing. I didn‚Äôt even make any friends the first 3-4 years I was t UofT. Only made 2 ‚Äúreal friends‚Äù and they were older and graduated 2 years ago, and only recently now I met nice, likeminded and cool people I like spending time with, chatting with and talking about life, university, our courses, charging notes, group study sessions etc. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm 25 now and value real experiences and genuine connections. And I missed out cuz I was a lesser experienced person at 18, with bad social skills, not confident, shy, awkward, and the pressure of uni got to me. 

So sign me up :)",comment,3

You‚Äôre definitely not the only one who feels like they‚Äôve missed out.¬†Something that‚Äôs helped me feel less behind is going to some of the drop-in programs at Hart House. They‚Äôre super low-pressure, no one comes in with established friend groups and you start seeing familiar faces week to week. A few good ones to try:


Weekly Social Stop (Tuesdays) with snacks, games, chill space to just meet people.


Get Crafty! (Thursdays) is an easy icebreaker since you‚Äôre making something while you chat.


Queer & Trans drop-ins (if that‚Äôs your community) are super welcoming and affirming spaces.


It‚Äôs kind of like what you‚Äôre describing... people show up open to connection, no pressure to have a big friend group already. If you go a couple times, it really does start to feel like you‚Äôve got your own ‚Äúclub‚Äù of people who are just there to experience campus life together. üíô",comment,1
