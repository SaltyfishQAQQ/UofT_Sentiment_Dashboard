Ig: @edenflowerstoronto

They‚Äôre super reliable and responsive if you dm them on ig. I always get my flowers there and have used their delivery service too. Their prices are very reasonable and the quality of their flowers are great. They‚Äôre a small family business and they‚Äôre very friendly.",comment,22

- 4.9 ‚≠êÔ∏è Kingston Flower Delivery | 966 Kingston Rd, Toronto, ON M4E 1S7 (Scarborough but still 8~ km away from UTSC)
- 4.9 ‚≠êÔ∏èSweetpea‚Äôs | 169 Roncesvalles Ave, Toronto, ON M6R 2L3 (Downtown) 
- 4.8 ‚≠êÔ∏è Amarilis Flowers | 2 locations, both downtown, check which is closer to your GFs house
- 5 ‚≠êÔ∏èLeo Flower | 235 Spadina Ave. #1, Downtown Toronto, ON M5T 2E2 (Downtown) 

Also if she‚Äôs a big flower person then tell her about visiting the Toronto Flower Market. It‚Äôs seasonal, only one Saturday every month and October 11 is the last day that it‚Äôs happening for this year. Going early is better because I went closer to closing and it was empty,  barely any flowers left.",comment,4

I've never been disappointed by the help they've provided, or their pricing. As im a student myself, they've gone above and beyond to help work in my budget too. I strongly recommend them.",comment,1
