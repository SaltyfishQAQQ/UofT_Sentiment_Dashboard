I analyzed over 1000+ clubs to find the most interesting events at UofT (+ Update on Orientation events),elagon-ai,1nh6tcw,https://i.redd.it/j0drunt8v7pf1.png,1757894045.0,"Hey guys!! A couple of weeks ago, I posted an orientation event list here, and the amount of support was crazy! That inspired me to turn that into something bigger. Hopefully, this newsletter can help brighten up our semesters and give everyone more reasons to get out there.

I have gathered all the coolest events happening at UofT and made a little newsletter that recommends the most fun/interesting ones!

In my first year, I missed so many events just because I didnâ€™t even know they were happeningâ€¦ and honestly, I donâ€™t want anyone else to go through that. Sometimes we need those random, exciting breaks that make uni actually memorable.

Thanks for all the love so far ðŸ’™ you guys are the reason I even made this.
