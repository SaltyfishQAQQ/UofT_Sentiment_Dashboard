Finally, I decided to see a psychiatrist this year and discovered that I have severe anxiety, CPTSD, and ADHD, which led to my suspension for a year. For the past two years, I've barely left the house or spoken, resulting in poor attendance and failing many classes. The worst part is, my application to appeal my suspension has been denied. Also, as an international student, I need to renew my study visa before September 30th, but I currently don't have proof of enrollment, which makes it impossible. Also, since I'm not registered as a student, I can't access the university's health services. I feel like my life has become completely awful since I started university, and I see no hope. I'm bisexual, and my family rejects and even dislikes my sexual orientation. My parents prefer my younger brother, and I'm currently receiving virtually no financial or emotional support from them. I don't know what to do......",submission,29

It might also be easier to petition to drop the courses if you missed the final assignment and assessment,comment,2

Try and submit an appeal, and gather a plan to present to your academic advisor on how youll try and keep on track, and how they can help you. Your advisors genuinely want to see you do well and succeed so make sure to talk to them. 

And also what I personally did though if your currently on suspension is work or figure out why youre at uoft and if the best method is to transfer schools as well. It may seem scary and feel like youre quitting, but sometimes transferring out into a new environment where you can start over, without ghost of your past haunting you feels liberating.

Most of all though I hope you take care of yourself and everything works out well for you. As someone who was in a similar position to you a year ago, I know you can work through it. Fighting!!",comment,2

I was in a similar position last year. Are you with ATS ? They were an absolute godsend to me. Get documentation from a psychologist. That was immensely helpful. I think there's low-cost sliding scale programs. I really relate to you so you are more than welcome to dm me if you like.,comment,1

From what you've written, it sounds like no, no you wouldn't be going to classes. 

And that's maybe why the suspension hasn't been lifted.",comment,0

Yes, I will do my best to attend classes. After being diagnosed this year, I've received help from the Accessibility Center, which has helped me avoid public speaking, which is unsettling and even terrifying. I'm currently taking medication for my social anxiety and other symptoms. I attended some in-person support groups over the summer, and my difficulty speaking in large groups has improved somewhat. I'll emphasize these efforts in my next appeal. Thank you for reminding me!",comment,2

There is no requirement in basically any degree that you go to every lecture and tutorial, if you have disability-related reasons why you can't. That's the whole point of the volunteer notetaker system for example.

Labs usually are more strict about attendance but again, the course coordinator is literally _required by university policy and arguably the law_ to accommodate if you can't go to a lab/labs (again assuming you have a disability related reason and Accessibility Services have given you an Accomodation Letter.)",comment,5
