\- what do u bring to the gym with you? do u guys bring a change of clothes?  
\- are the changing rooms nice or nah? do u guys also shower there or go back and shower at home?

I'd never gone to a gym before but it wasn't intimidating at all. I've done group classes and personal training and enjoyed those too.

\-The whole place is a little bit of a maze. There's a pool, big gym, and several smaller spaces for classes, weights, etc. You're generally allowed to go wherever you want, but you can just ask if people mind if you join. The big gym is my favourite because there are lots of people.   
\-I think only some of the smaller spaces, if any, have AC though, so you should factor weather into your plans until at least October.  
\-They scan your TCard at the front desk so make sure you have it with you.  
\-Bring a combination lock for the lockers. Do not bring valuables to the lockers as I've heard there's lots of theft, (especially at the Athletics Centre). I've never had anything stolen at Hart House but better safe than sorry.  
\-Changing/showering is kinda up to your personal preference. If I'm going home right after I don't shower/change at the gym cause I'd just rather at home.  But if you're doing stuff after the gym and want to feel clean you can change/shower there. Bring your own soap/shampoo; they provide towels at the front desk. Also up to your comfort level if you want to shower naked or in something. The stalls are private with shower curtains.  
\-I've not heard of a real dress code but just wear appropriate gym stuff and you'll be fine. They probably just don't want boots messing up the floors etc.  
\-I like having earbuds to listen to podcasts or music.  
\-I only drink water at the gym. Definitely remember a water bottle! There are several drinking fountains around the gym.  
\-Remember to wipe down equipment after you use it. There are wipe stations among the equipment.

That's all I can think of! It's been a while since I've gone but now I'm inspired. Have fun!",comment,24
can someone please explain how to go to the gym at uoft,ExcellentCapKen,ncaro6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n7vp0o/can_someone_please_explain_how_to_go_to_the_gym/ncaro6q/,1756949495.0,"1. Utsg has 3 gyms: Goldring, Athletic Centre (AC) & Hart House. Goldring is mainly squat racks and free weights, Hart House is mostly machines (but has 2 squat racks), and AC is a mix of the two. I'd assume they're all equally busy, usually around 12-3 and 5-6, and probably pretty unoccupied in the mornings.
2. Just wear gym/athletic attire, bring headphones to listen to music while you work out, and yes, bring a change of clothes.
3. The change rooms are fine but you have to bring your own lock for the lockers. You can shower there, but I personally just shower at home.
4. Hart House doesn't endorse open toe shoes just because it can be a hazard if you drop weights on your toes, so I'd assume the other gyms are probably like that as well. They aren't too strict on clothing otherwise, you can wear jeans and they won't tell you to leave.

Extra: 
-You can bring a water bottle but they have water fountains there.
-If the gym is busy and you want to use a machine that someone is occupying, you can ask them AFTER their set how many more sets/how much longer they intend on using the machine. Most people will be willing to let you alternate and work in with them, but if they don't offer to, they might not rest for long in between sets or are lowkey an a**hole.",comment,13

As for other things to bring, change of clothes, headphones, water bottle, a lock for your locker, and I would recommend a towel because the towels are paid. No dress code but obviously dress for exercising.",comment,4

I’m at the Scarborough campus and we have the Toronto pan am sports centre. I actually work there too lol. But our centre is open for all UofT students and I really encourage everyone to come to the facility. You just swipe in with your T-card. It’s really state of the art, the equipment, pool, activities, there’s drop in sports programs (basketball/tennis/badminton/basically everything tbh), the change rooms are clean, accessible, has day lockers, the showers are super nice, the gym has two floors (I’m more of a swimmer so I can’t say much about the gym sorry!) but there’s also programs that UTSC athletic and recreation department runs like weight lighting for beginners, there’s women’s only times for the gym/pool. The pan am centre itself also has registered programs (free for current students since you’re paying the membership in tuition), there’s a lot of cycling/yoga/pilates programs and I think there’s some beginner gym programs sometimes too. 

So, again swimmer here, but what’s in my bag is a change of clothes, plastic bags for my flip flops/swimsuit/towel, mini travel toiletries kit for my bodywash/shampoo/conditioner/lotion/skincare/deodorant, a combination lock, a mini hair dryer, hair brush, some extra hair ties. You might not need all of that if you’re not showering each time. You need a change of shoes specifically for the gym, as for the drinks, I stick to water and maybe Gatorade if I feel like. Not much of a protein shake person, and again you don’t really need it, you’re fine with water. See how things are before jumping into all the extras.",comment,3

Goldring is by New College and the Athletic Centre is by St Hilda’s at Trinity college. 

If you bring a lock for the lockers at the gym, you can use those to store things for the showers and bring a change of clothes. I mean thats just up to you. Personally, I never showered there but I would bring a change of clothes. 

I don’t recall any rules about pants, and I believe the rules about shoes was just essentially no winter boots or outside shoes in the gym. Like, treat it like an indoor space. Outdoor shoes not allowed (but honestly sneakers would probably be fine so long as you didn’t walk through the snow in them immediately prior).",comment,7

I recommend an app like boostcamp to track your workouts and learn how to use machines. personally I would start on the treadmill if I were you because it's important to learn to breathe while exercising. treadmill will be hell at firs but your body is conditioning itself and the same workout will be easy within a few days. after a few weeks of just cardio, you can start lifting weights. I bring a change of clothes, and imo the goldring gym is usually busy all the time, but it has less equipment anyway so athletic centre is nice. if you're a woman, the athletic centre has woman only hours for the gym",comment,1
