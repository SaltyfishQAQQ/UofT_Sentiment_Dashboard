It is still super interesting just less rigorous lol. If you are a math major/specialist, I’ll just say it is entirely normal to be struggling this much at the beginning. MAT157 and MAT137 aren’t designed to be easy courses, MAT157 especially requires the most time and is really hard at first since you’re probably not used to proofs at all. Just put in the work and week by week it’ll get easier. Definitely attend office hours and just ask many questions as possible. Nothing is stupid trust me the profs know you’re probably lost. 6 hours may seem a lot for these homework questions but i promise its normal at first.

First year was very rough for me as well, but you can absolutely get better if you stick with this.

I think the general advice section (and other sections) in this document I'm [linking](https://courses.maths.ox.ac.uk/pluginfile.php/30903/mod_resource/content/33/Introduction%20to%20University%20Mathematics.pdf) is excellent for people learning to do proofs, and it took me possibly more than a year to get used to applying all of these. I could have saved myself a lot of time if I learned these lessons sooner. I wrote my finals in my first semester without really being aware of some of these things and struggled a bit needlessly.

You wouldn't learn this in high school probably, but you will be tested as if you knew about it. I think start by remembering this advice, and know what proof by contradiction, contrapositive, etc. are (to the level where you could explain clearly what they are to someone in plain English).

Besides that, I suggest getting to know other students and taking advantage of office hours whenever you're stuck. It's common for students to get help and help each other to finish assignments in a reasonable amount of time.

The fact that you have the grit to focus for 6 hours to do 2 questions is already a sign that you have a good work ethic, which is very important in my opinion. You should try to balance independent hard work (which is important and constructive) and getting some kind of help if you feel like you're going to lose your mind otherwise. Just wanted to suggest this because I spent my first half of my undergrad doing all assignments by myself. I would learn by working very hard to figure things out, but I probably would have learned more if I picked my battles so to speak.",comment,8

It was the second hardest undergrad course I took (the course I enjoyed most though was 257). What follows is my perspective from the specialist program (and having TAed X57 courses).

 - The most important thing you have to do is truly ask yourself whether you’re in it because you like math (as opposed to something silly like flexing academic prowess). You have to enjoy what you’re learning if not I really don’t see any way to succeed in this course.

 - I highly recommend enrolling in the proofs course (Mat138 I think, and Mat102 in UTM). I don’t think this is “mandatory” for math majors or specialists, but this was the single most useful course I tool in undergrad, because without it, I wouldn’t have truly understood the basic informal logic hence my 157 would have been shaky (hence 257 etc). I think it’s important to see basic logic and gain familiarity using examples from basic arithmetic and algebra, rather than being hit by a train with epsilon-delta as the first introduction.

 - Go to tutorials and ask your TA questions (and prof as well of course). Go to their office hours and ask questions. Come prepared (“I have a question about ___ specifically. I read ___ from Spivak and tried ___ but I still haven’t gotten anywhere”). Go regularly, not just the week of the tests. As a TA, I can’t express how many times I’ve had weaker students come to me last minute and ill-prepared - no matter how much I try to help, it’s too late by then. [Edit: Also go to the MLC when it’s not busy if you can… I think technically speaking it’s not for 157, but you can learn a lot from the 137 questions as well… also there have been tons of times when I’ve been an MLC TA that no one shows up. in that case if you’re nice about it and you find a good TA there, they may be willing to help].

 - Talk to your classmates about problem sets (but do NOT copy). If you discuss, then make sure you go home and write by yourself.

 - Do several problems from Spivak. For reference: I did about 85-90% of all problems in Spivak (chapters 1-24) and I ended up with a 97% overall. You learn math by reading and doing problems, and Spivak’s textbook is amazing (and has several interesting problems: eg clever use of bisection arguments, and an outline of one of the original proofs (without MVT) that f’=0 on an interval implies f is constant, etc).

 - A week before tests I would you look up old Mat157 tests and time myself, because knowing the concepts is one thing but crunching it out under time pressure is another.


I spent lots of time on Mat157 and 240 (originally more for 240 because linear algebra was new to me, but later more for 157 since epsilon-delta is logically more demanding). Sometimes it would take me anywhere from a 0-1h or 3-5h or even up to 2 days to solve a problem (homework or Spivak). So if the amount of time spent is what you’re worried about, then I’d say you’re on track. This is not a course which you can postpone to the day before.


 - Sometimes when I inevitably get tired (after 1-2h) of a given problem and I fail, I move on to a different one. This allows me to clear my mind and try something new. Of course it may happen that I struggle with the other problem too. Then I either return to the original problem or move on to a new one (I usually stick to a max cycle of 3 unsolved problems). Then I repeat the cycle, and there have been many times where failed attempts at one problem nudge you along in another problem which you end up solving, and then that gives you the confidence/insight into solving the original problem. So it’s all a cycle, and failure is actually a good thing because a failed attempt at one problem could (after slight modifications) be key to another.


I really like this cycling approach as it keeps me sane (especially now when I’m doing research); of course you can also switch subjects while you’re at it. 


Finally, let’s not lose sight of the fact that what you’re learning now is a concentrated, top-down distillation of a subject, whose essential theorems, organization took a good 250-300 years to perfect (and to recognize the need for such rigorous standards). It took some of Mathematics’ brightest minds, spanning centuries, to achieve this, yet you’re expected to learn it all in a year. It’s definitely doable, but don’t be too hard on yourself if you’re struggling (some of the early practitioners never figured out the solutions to problems, problems which you’ll, hopefully, be able to answer by the end of the year :)

Hope that’s helpful (and also reassuring that the amount of time you’re spending is normal).",comment,7

1. The lecture design is not good. There are some logical transitions that I know because I know them, but are never actually explained. I am not sure how an average student is supposed to get through those.
2. Tutorials haven't started yet. After the tutorial is when you start panicking, but before hope that your confusion will be answered.
3. They don't teach proofs, which is brutal. Find some practice problems online (not HW obviously) (or even the ones we did in class) and feed them to ChatGPT. Then spam it with questions on how to formulate every single detail. Ask ChatGPT to make you some graphs and visualizations or whatever.
4. Spend at least 2 hours digging for books and resources on the internet. (Not YouTube tutorials, but pdfs and lecture recordings. The older, the better.)

1. Say goodbye to friends and a social life. If you're going for it for your program and it's a specific requirement, prepare to make it a time commitment and emotional investment and more.

2. If you want it for the flex, consider psychology (I don't mean this in any insulting way) to see WHY you want it and to understand the rationale because it is brutal. Perhaps by doing that, you can expand your views and see more.

3. If you're going for maths, econ and many others, consider downgrading to MAT137. It feels a lot better (according to friends) to have downgraded and gotten As or Bs than failing or dropping the course.

4. Look at yourself and what you want to accomplish in life. Look at whether this will be a source of pain or regret. Did I get a good grade in it? I did. Do I wish I had downgraded? 1000% and I would trade my A for a shitty B in MAT137 if it meant I could have had better sleep and an easier time in first year.

5. Look at the entire program and pace yourself. The last thing you want is to burn out on one course.

6. Use office hours like the energy drinks you'll be taking in. Annoy the shit out of the prof and TA to learn. They aren't there to be your friend, you're a paying customer getting a service. Use them. I'll guarantee you'll impress them and the prof might open some doors, then forget you within 3 months.",comment,2

9. Try looking up A-Levels from the UK, specifically Core Maths, Further Maths, to get a lot of extra tips and tricks.

The textbook is Calculus by Micheal Spivak, 4th edition. However, note that mat157 is more for people interested in pursuing pure math in the future so if you are only interested in pursuing a subject that requires math but isn't just pure math you will not have to take this course as there are easier alternatives. Interestingly enough, high school math barely prepares you for this course so if you're interested in what this course is about you can look through the textbook even without having fully caught up with high school math and I doubt you'll get a different experience from your average new 157 student, especially at the beginning.

You can always do something like ECO101/CSC108 in the summer. 157/240 are hard courses and it takes time to acclimate to them.",comment,1

I get chills thinking of MAT157 and also laugh about it when looking back, esp when I sold my textbook. This kid paid me the full 130 bucks in quarters, took 2 TD employees and myself 15 mins to count them all haha

Hope this helps!",comment,1
