The energy to produce the paper towel is, as you allude to, less than that of a hand dryer (assuming 2 paper towels vs an 1800 watt dryer). However, that does not account for the transport of the paper towel, which has emissions. Buuuut then again in some places the power grid is so heavily fossil fuel based that goes the other way yet again.

In short: they‚Äôre pretty comparable if you aren‚Äôt the jerk who uses 20 paper towels.

Also, importantly, the situation has altered slightly in favour of electric dryers in recent years as we have developed more efficient hand dryers.

Why. Studies with seemingly contradictory results that require further research to reconcile is how science is supposed to work.
