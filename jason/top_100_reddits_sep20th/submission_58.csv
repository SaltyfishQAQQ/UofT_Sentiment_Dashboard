"If you have a course taught by Pitt and Baumgartner, do NOT take Baumgartner",L1ggy,1nhq3tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nhq3tv/if_you_have_a_course_taught_by_pitt_and/,1757952577.0,"There are several CS courses that are taught by Gary Baumgartner and Francois Pitt, (CSC165, CSC236) and having attended lectures from both, I strongly encourage anyone with the opportunity, to not take the Baumgartner classes. Baumgartner rambles, scribbles and does not teach. His classes have no structure and he is often unintelligible in his writing. He struggles to explain anything. Francois Pitt teaches with structure, and writes and speaks clearly. If you have the choice, never take a class with Baumgartner and always opt for the Pitt section.",submission,54

Had to uh go home and watch Francois’ lectures to understand what was happening lol. And then I just did CSC236 with Francois lol.

That being said, Gary wasn’t really that bad. The math department has some abysmal profs",comment,18
