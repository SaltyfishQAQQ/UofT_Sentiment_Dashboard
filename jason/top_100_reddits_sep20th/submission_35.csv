"DONT FALL FOR THIS PHISHING EMAIL SCAM, NOT REAL and not from UofT",Tcampbe8,1n4d4b0,https://i.redd.it/albwzgjz58mf1.jpeg,1756589346.0,"This email isn't real for all the new and upcoming student at UofT this year. UofT doesn't do e-transfers, and if you have OSAP, you don't have to put a deposit down as long as you deferred your courses. Please stay safe, report the email! Don't want you guys losing money <3",submission,110

I did in fact still owe tuition and automatically assumed this was true because of the timing (fall deadline fees) and utoronto.ca email. I ended up sending 3k. Looking back it was so obvious but in the moment I didn’t even think to check if it was fraud. I’ve never felt so stupid in my life and I’m genuinely not sure if I’ll be able to leave my bed. Obviously I’ve contacted my bank, the police, and campus security but I’ll prob not get the money back and will have to pay my tuition (3k) to utm eventually. Idc if people make fun of me, I made a mistake and I’ll just have to deal with the consequences.",comment,1
