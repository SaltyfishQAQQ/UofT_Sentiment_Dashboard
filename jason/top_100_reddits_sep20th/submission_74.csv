Harbord Bakery is very close to campus and has deli-style salads (bean salads, pasta salad, couscous, beets, etc.) sold by weight. 

Dear Saigon at College and St George has yummy bún - I wouldn’t call it healthy per se but there are veggies involved and you can probably get two meals out of it. 

On the other side of Queen’s Park, there’s imPerfect Fresh Eats on Bay St. 

There’s also a Metro at Bloor and Spadina, an Independent at Bay and Bloor, a Farm Boy at Bay and College, and a T&T at College and Spadina (idk about salads there but there’s a hot food bar with veggies).",comment,23
