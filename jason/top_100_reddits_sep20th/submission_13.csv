I have ruined my GPA and brought shame upon my family,Mindless_Impress6483,1nfodrp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nfodrp/i_have_ruined_my_gpa_and_brought_shame_upon_my/,1757738155.0,"I usually get good grades, but last semester I ruined my GPA with lots of very bad grades. In hindsight, I just didn't focus and study hard like I should have. There were no extenuating circumstances like health issues, I just didn't study hard enough. Now, my prospects for grad school are near zero, and I have disgraced my entire family.

My mother has said that grad school is non-negotiable. Everyone in my family has at least a Master's, and they will disown me if I can't at least obtain a Master's from a prestigious university. My sisters (both of whom are doing PhDs right now) said to me that getting good grades was the one thing I had going for me, and now I have lost that too. My father says that if I was going to fail like this anyways, I should never have gone to UofT in the first place; I could have just gone to some no-name university and saved everyone the trouble. The truth is, I'm an international student and my parents worked very hard to fund my expensive education, so I have wasted a lot of their money now. When I first came to Canada, I was the pride of my family, but now at all the family gatherings my parents are forced to pretend I don't exist, out of shame.

My parents have told me to return to the motherland immediately following my graduation and find work so that I can repay the funds they invested into my education. My own dream of grad school is over now; by the time I pay them back I will be well past the window of productivity in my field of interest. I wish I could say that life is just unfair sometimes, but in this case life has actually been very fair to me, and my situation is entirely self-inflicted. Studying at UofT is a privilege, and I wish I had not taken this opportunity for granted.",submission,244

All I will say is your parents disowning you if you don’t graduate with a masters from a highly prestigious university is fucking ridiculous, and any reasonable person would understand having an off semester. 

My dad took 9 years to finish his undergrad with a bachelors in engineering, and he barely used that degree, and now he can afford to send me internationally to u of t from brazil. But you and your parents think there will be no opportunities for you in life if you don’t get a masters at a top 20 school.

Just a btw, but most grad schools will look at your last 2 years of grades, and what they want to see most is an upward trend. 

I ended up going to law school after undergrad, and while I performed quite well in first year, I ended up adding a program I hadn’t originally planned to study that was in a different discipline to what I’m used to (more sciences than humanities) and did on the lower side of average in those courses. I was also worried that it would impact any postsecondary aspirations that I had — but it didn’t. I did better in third and fourth year, and ended up focusing more on my strengths via course selection (ie choosing courses I knew I would do better in, even in my new major). 

So I wouldn’t discount grad school entirely. Even if you are in third or fourth year — you can always choose to extend your degree with more credits and not graduate on time if grad school is non-negotiable. Consider that these programs look at your last two years, and not specifically at your third and fourth year.",comment,23

Honestly, I know how heavy the pressure feels — especially when your parents have sacrificed so much to send you abroad. The guilt of not meeting their expectations can eat you alive. But let me tell you this straight: your life is not over just because you had one bad semester.

When I came here after high school, I had no safety net. I had to juggle paying international tuition fees while working 2–3 part-time jobs just to survive. There were days I thought I couldn’t keep going. My grades slipped too, but you know what? Things did eventually get better — because life isn’t defined by one season of struggle.

You only get this one life. And if you spend it only trying to meet your family’s definitions of “success,” you’ll lose yourself. Yes, it’s good to respect your parents and repay their efforts, but you also need to protect your own mental health and dreams. Grad school is still possible — people bounce back from academic dips all the time with extra coursework, post-grad diplomas, or research experience. Even if you don’t end up in the “prestigious” path your family wants, you can still carve out a future where you feel proud of yourself.

The truth is, failure doesn’t mean you’re done — it means you’ve been given a chance to learn resilience. Everyone successful has had moments where they thought they ruined everything. What matters is how you get up now.

So instead of burying yourself in guilt, start fresh:
	•	Focus on doing your best in your remaining courses. A strong comeback matters.
	•	Explore internships, co-ops, or work that can build your profile — grad schools value practical experience too.
	•	And most importantly, remember that you’re not just living for your parents’ pride. You’re living for yourself.

I understand the pressure to “do a Master’s for your parents.” I’ve felt that weight too. But at the end of the day, you can’t let one GPA dip convince you that your whole life is ruined. You’re still young, you still have time, and you still have the chance to make something out of this journey.

Trust me — the story isn’t over.",comment,7

Don't give up hope because of one bad semester if your track record has been generally good. 


That aside, I will say that if you're planning to do an MSc, you need to have intrinsic motivation, not just fear of your parents. Research takes a lot of work, willpower, and dedication. There is alot less handholding.

When you have children, you have all sorts of hopes and for many people expectations can be part of that. But the truth is, a child is not your property, pawn, or chance to live out what you missed. Your parents will never say this to you but as a parent I will: part of maturing is doing the work to learn yourself, and this is usually in-step with developing the resolve and courage to disappoint those who love you most. You are not their project, they do not get to demand your indefinite future in exchange for what they sacrificed for you to fulfill their dreams for you. As an emerging adult, your own fulfillment for your life is north star. 

So, you reflected and saw your grades dropped bc you fucked around instead of nose to the grindstone, in years that matter for future. Yeah that sucks and I see why your parents are pissed re: $ paid. Now what? Work hard again and finish as strong as you can, that's all you can control. The bigger work is learning the skill of setting your own goals and the work back plan. If it includes a graduate degree, great go for it. If not, go for whatever it is instead. Maybe a year or two in the workforce will help inform this, maybe longer. Your parents will hopefully chill a bit when they see you working hard with the ethic they taught you and doing well.

Not a cent. They CHOSE to give birth to you, and they CHOSE to send you to school. Nobody forced them to, so they have no one to blame but themselves for expecting anything at all from their children. 

See how things go and if you can appeal to their emotions at all. If they still want to disown you and have you work in your home country to pay back the money, then try your best to become self sufficient outside of them. As disownment means those people no longer mean anything to you, and any debt to them is effectively null.  

It's not too late to fix your GPA and achieve not only success, but emotional and financial independence from your family. Now it's not easy in any sense, but it's reasonably achievable - especially if you've been capable of hard work in the past.   Don't let any notions of guilt or shame make you pay them back. If they want to treat you based on your perceived value to them rather than their child, then they should understand that they are absolutely no different from a venture capitalist. Unless you've signed some sort of legally binding contract that indicates you have to pay them back if you don't perform as expected, then I fear they've lost their money and that's on them for not understanding the risk.  

While this might sound harsh, I'm only mirroring their perspective of this being a numbers game. I'm assuming that you've felt intense pressure even before this - that stress can accumulate and cause you to burn out. Your GPA doesn't just take a significant hit for no reason. If you didn't study or focus as much as you expected, was it really just out of laziness? Despite everything perceptually riding on your success? I highly doubt that and I suggest that you look within yourself to figure out if there was anything else causing you to not study or lose focus.

I'm at U of T and my departments requirement for grad school is a B+... Also sorry, but the whole ranking schools based on prestige thing is completely overblown as a metric of academic success. There are incredible scholars at all universites.",comment,2

I get that sometimes u can be a disappointment for your parents but u gotta realize it’s your life and choices. What you do 10 years down the line doesn’t affect them when you’re successful in your own way. 

You def don’t need a masters to do well in Canada. Heck u don’t even need a good GPA. Sure it helps… A lot… But at the end of the day it’s up to your personality and efforts that lands a job. 

I didn’t have good grades either. I worked all throughout university. My gpa was at 2.7-2.9 range every year. I came here as an immigrant and now a citizen. So it’s not like I received any help or connection from my parents. Yet I’m about to be an associate director and doing relatively rn compared to 3-4 years ago. 

Hard work pays off. If you’re like me and don’t do well in school then go to trade. If u don’t like trade try innovation. Just gotta keep pushing and find your area.

I totally bombed my first year but I pulled my socks up and made the other years much better. My poor grades from my first year didn’t stop me from getting a masters and then a PhD, never even came up as an issue. I feel your pain OP but you can totally turn things around!",comment,5

This is a policy by the UofT graduate unit. In many cases (and graduate administrators told me that) instead of ""credits"" which can be completely unrelated they look for specific courses in the subject instead)",comment,2

They only use their kids to further their own egos . God, how I hate parents like thi. Sorry but They sound like real dirtbags. All parents should not make their love conditional on anything except their kids being a good person. ignore them. 
So it sounds as though your heart just can’t in this or you weren’t ready for it. Maybe you need a year off to recalibrate and mature and rest. I did that. I took 2 years away from a disastrous undergrad performance. I just didn’t get the whole thing.  I was immature. But then I went back part time at night, upped my grades and then did a very successful master with lots of invites to do a doctorate. It worked because I was ready and I wanted it! Not someone else wanting it. 
You do NOT need to be ashamed. Things come to different people at different times. Do NOT accept his parent’s orders. You are an adult now. Take a breath, step back, recuperate and figure out next steps.  And you are now in Canada. You can be who ever you want to be. It ain’t the “old country”. No one here cares 
 do you want to do?",comment,2
