i even tried to be nice (mistake, clearly) and told y‚Äôall very calmly ‚Äúhey, can you whisper, we can‚Äôt hear.‚Äù 

what do i get? a smirk. silence for a whole two minutes (wow, so generous), and then you were right back at it like nothing happened. like you‚Äôre the main character and the prof is just background noise. love that.

if you wanna play games and treat uni like a caf√©, do it from home. no one‚Äôs stopping you. but don‚Äôt come to class and ruin it for everyone else who‚Äôs actually trying to, idk, learn something. wild concept, i know. because if this happens again, i won‚Äôt be so polite. just saying. genuinely crashing out.",submission,393
