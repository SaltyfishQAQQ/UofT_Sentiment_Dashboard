Feeling real down and horrible about the first week of uni,rangos_,1n9799c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1n9799c/feeling_real_down_and_horrible_about_the_first/,1757083598.0,"I was really, really looking forward to my first year of engineering (MIE) during the summer, but now that I’m here for real, the novelty has worn off. I’m feeling quite sad, upset, awful, homesick, and a litany of other negative adjectives.

I’m originally from BC—so this is my first time living away from home independently. I seriously don’t feel ready to move on from my adolescence (physically, mentally, and emotionally) sometimes. Every time I think about my home, my family, my friends, and the comfortable environment I had, I start to cry. I’m currently writing this post through tears. 

It feels really embarrassing when everyone else I know who’s out of province or international seems to handle it well.

Other than the homesickness, I’m struggling with anxiety and imposter syndrome. I’m so worried for the work load ahead of me and the possibility of failing. I knew that engineering is a notoriously difficult program before applying, but now that I’m actually here, it feels too real. I’ve always been good at time management and getting things done ahead of time—but I don’t know if I have what it takes to tackle this. 

I hope it gets better. I wish I could just fall asleep and wake up back in my home again. :(



EDIT: Thank you to everyone who responded with their own experiences, advice, and guidance. I really appreciate the community here :) I just had lunch with a few people from my major, and although I'm still feeling a little blue, I certainly am doing better.",submission,191

I will have to say with the eng workload its uber crucial you have a proper routine. 

I knew people who lacked time management skills and it eventually led them to a worser state within the first 2 months; very behind on content, failing midterms, etc,. And yes, you definitely do have what it takes: everyone does. 

There is never really an average or real norm here, especially in eng. Some of my peers are 4-5 years older than me, others are on work-terms, theres people from all over the world, people doing their second degree or prodigy students. You can't really ever expect to fit in regardless. Its just a matter of being content with yourself :D",comment,45

Give yourself grace, but also focus on settling in to a routine. Go to your classes, eat healthy meals, try to spend some time outside every day. Talk to people in your classes, in your dorm, maybe look into signing up for 1 or 2 activities (club, weekly fitness class, anything!). You're not going to feel better immediately (a walk will not actually cure all your issues, unforunately), but you will get there with time. It's overwhelming moving across the country and starting university! Take yourself out for a treat (fancy coffee, baked good, whatever you feel like) on the weekend to celebrate finishing the week. Actually keep up with your classes (doing the readings, reviewing notes after class). If you're still feeling this unhappy mid to late September, think about talking to someone in counselling services. It sounds like you have supportive friends and family back home - you can build that here in Toronto, and remember that your friends and family love you and want you to succeed!",comment,22

Look it is normal to have imposter syndrome in this fuckass school. Especially when some of the students were doing masters degrees when they were in middle schools. But this your path, your race, your life- and when is your life you can go as fast you want. Do not feel that that you are obligated to succeed, it must be in your volition to go through the school year and achieve what you want. 

Ps, even if you are just an “average” student here, you’d be average in the top engineering program not only in Canada but in the whole fucking world. remember what NBA legend Brian Scalabrini (regarded the worse nba player ever); “I am closer to LeBron than you are close to me”.",comment,24

First year is rough in multiple ways, there's no point sugarcoating it. That doesn't mean there aren't upsides, though, because we wouldn't survive without them. In 1st year I relied heavily on my roommates; we would all do our CIV100 and APS110/188/186/187 stuff together. If you can, find people who you can form a study group with and seek them out multiple times a week; that support meant the world to me.

The relationship between workload and marks is strange. The workload is objectively rough, but a lot of the stress people have I feel would be mitigated if it were more properly told to people that being 5% above the average on a midterm is like a 96% in high school. Depending on your goals, you might still want to push for a 3.25 GPA, but we wouldn't shame anyone in HS with a 93% average, now would we?

And yes, everyone saying to join a club is good advice. Design teams can be fun and provide a built-in community, while obviously boosting your resume, but I can admit they can be stressful. I have friends in UTSM, UTAT, UTFR, Blue Sky, Concrete Toboggan, Concrete Canoe, UTWind, RSX, HPVDT...

But I can't resist recommending the spirit clubs! My friends would shill for emailing [kaboom@skule.ca](mailto:kaboom@skule.ca) about when cannon guard training is, or following \\@bngcommittee on instagram for holiday builds and woodworking fun, or contributing to Skule Nite in whatever form you wish. Myself, well, I'd say you should write for the Toike Oike, and maybe join the mailing list at [lgmb.skule.ca](http://lgmb.skule.ca) ...

Also, our discipline club is cool, and our common room in the mining building is a bit run down but still a good study/hangout spot. :P

One last thing:

>everyone else I know who’s out of province or international seems to handle it well

Just know that this is absolutely not true and there are tons of people in the same boat. Trust me. Lean on your peers for support, and you can do this!",comment,9

Almost started crying on campus at the end of lecture during my second week- the next day I made some friends that made my first year my favourite one. Still get imposter syndrome some days when my grades aren’t doing well, but building a community around you at UofT definitely helps. Hang in there, it’s rough but it’ll get better. Join some clubs, talk to people (in your classes) that you think are similar to you and it may feel awkward at first but make friends with them. Make an effort during your first month to speak to them outside of class too and your experience at UofT will do a 180!!",comment,6

I thought about quitting, but I had a worse feeling that if I did quit before trying that it would just become a theme in my life.  


I told myself time and again it would get better and that everything would be alright. In my case I made some friends, got into a groove with classes and got settled right in.


Don't fear failure - if you put your best effort forward and still fail at least you tried.  Quitting in fear of being inadequate will just intensify that feeling.  Better to have tried and failed than to have never tried at all.


Keep your chin up, it's all going to be OK even if you do fail.",comment,4

It's supposed to be sad and it's good to feel sad and cry about it. The feeling won't last too long. It's a necessary step toward progressing to the next stage of live in a healthy manner. What's way worse is when people refuse to move on and become adult children. Keep processing and feeling your emotions, it's a good thing to do.

I remember talking to my boyfriend (he just graduated from MechEng!) and he said the imposter syndrome he felt first year was crazy and that there was always somebody going above and beyond in his classes. He said first year felt the hardest but once he made it through, he really enjoyed the rest of his time at UofT!!

Please just remember to take care of yourself! Don't feel pressured by what others are doing in terms of academics or extra curriculars, do everything at your pace and what is comfortable for you! Try to create a routine of some sort (Ik that can get hard as the semester picks up), and keep in touch with your family/friends often. I honeslty call my parents ALOT and sometimes not for anything important, just for the comfort of hearing them.

I know first year is quite rough and it sucks feeling homesick but once you get started with school, become busy, and hang around with friends you'll fit right in. 

Just a quick tip, it's important to study and manage time well and everything but leave some time at least once a week to do something fun. 

This can be anything from watching netflix, going on a walk, or hanging around with friends. Just make sure to allocate some time because in the long run, it makes your life much nicer and you will always have something to look forward to each week. It also motivates you to get work done, so you can go have fun. 

Hope you enjoy the first year :) ",comment,3

* write your thoughts down, and if feeling really irritable go for a walk
* ask for help, go to office hours (schedule if possible)
* virtually meet with your family/friends on a regular basis, real friends will make time for you **if you ask for it and give something back in return (monetary and non monetary) imo** 
* consistency is key, the weather is going to get colder/enter winter so doing some prep (ex. buying cold medicine/instapot for quick meals/getting thermal pants from uniqlo) can remove the monotony of getting fed while needing to study when exam season comes",comment,2
