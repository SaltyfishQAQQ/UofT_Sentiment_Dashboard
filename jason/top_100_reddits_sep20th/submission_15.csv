Someone on that subreddit suggested I post them here as well so that other students might find them useful.  

So here's the first post, let me know if the community here finds these valuable.

[University is a Pull-Based System](https://medium.com/@brian_utsc/university-is-a-pull-based-system-5dd808c7beea)  
Highschool is ""Push-Based"", the goal is to give you the push to get you where you need to be. University is ""Pull-Based"", the goal is to provide resources that are available when you need them. Understanding this difference can be key to a successful transition between the two.

So they wait too long to get the resources they need, or (worse yet) never access them at all. And on the other side, the university spends huge amounts of money and resources making things available that never wind up getting used. And I think you're right, this isn't just a University problem, it's a life problem (but I'm an academic... so I can't comment on ""real life""... I've heard it's a scary place :-) )",comment,29

We're running a project with our lab that involves AI agents talking to students, and the health and we went to the health and wellness team to talk about what the agents should do when they sense that a student is in crisis. The default response was to send them to a webpage that was a giant wall of links. There were over 50 different resources and options for the student to choose from (lots of choice), but my response to them was that to a student in the midst of a crisis, a big wall of links is almost worse than no resources at all. It's overwhelming and intimidating.

Or on the other side, there are just lots and lots of resources that aren't advertised properly so that students searching them out can't easily find them.

Adding resources is great. But slow and expensive. Filtering and offering guidance to get the students the right things to pull is much faster, simpler, and can have a big impact right away.",comment,8

Some will rise to the top, some will sink to the bottom. There is not really a sense of supervision towards the students with regards to how the high school counselors used to help them. One thing that I really wanted my program supervisor to do is... **supervise** me in terms of maybe weekly meetings with regards to my academic progress, internship search, and mental health. For example, a marks/GPA tracking system could be built to monitor those who are falling behind if their marks fall below the threshold with automatic message sent to their e-mail notifying them about such developments. At the end of the day, I don't want to feel alone (or like another brick in the wall) when attending university.",comment,4

A university with a less cut throat environment and more social atmosphere would probably put students in a position where they feel obliged to use them far far less,comment,-1

Do you understand how many students there are at UofT? There are about 41,000 undergraduate students at the St. George campus. Let's say that meeting is 30 minutes. If it were someones job, 7 hours a day, 5 days a week to meet with undergrads to ""supervise"" them the university would need to employ nearly 600 people for this sole purpose. These 600 people would be doing nothing but meeting with undergrads. I'm sorry but in University you're an adult - act like one.",comment,17

We don't have the resources to push much of anything (why the scales are tipped so far is a longer discussion to have at another time).

But there's a second issue here: The ethos of the university is that students are adults and should be treated as such. If you come to me for help, I can offer you lots of stuff, but it's not my place to push you into my office (okay, the push/pull metaphor gets muddy here, but you get the idea).

Important note: I'm not saying how it SHOULD be here, I'm just commenting on how it IS to help students navigate the system that exists. I'm happy to have long discussions on ""should"", but you'll have to pull yourself into my office for those :-)",comment,4

Most professors really do like to know their students, and get involved to help/teach/advise at an individual level. I always encourage students to use office hours, for example- it's a great way to get past that anonymous/lost feeling, in my experience.",comment,4

The other post I recently shared had a section called ""Find your tribe"", that's a big recurring bugbear of mine. As a community, we've had a long understanding of the importance of supporting student's physical health. Recently I've seen improvements in people taking seriously the idea that students can't succeed without attention paid to their mental health. Social health is the next stage, and one of my professional life-goals is to get people to take it seriously.",comment,2
