If you‚Äôre at a leisure pace I would say 12 minutes? But when you‚Äôre walking like your life depends on it trust me it can be done in 8 minutes or less power walking is key. Anyways I would say leave your previous class 5 minutes earlier and you‚Äôll be good. I don‚Äôt follow that google maps path what I do is from Trinity I walk the path in front of Hart house and then cut through Kings circle to get to that building. But since you‚Äôre starting at the opposite side just do my path in reverse.,comment,20

I‚Äôve done that in the past and usually they‚Äôre ok with it unless they‚Äôve got a strict participation rule. Remember that there is UofT time where all classes start 10 minutes after the hour to take into account your exact situation. So a class which starts at 11:00 am in reality actually begins at 11:10 am.,comment,2

I remember vividly calling my mom from the middle of queens park 10 mins late for class and deeply confused and this was 15 yrs ago. You‚Äôll never regret giving people grace to have experiences for the first time and learn from them. Shaming people for not knowing things makes people stop asking questions.
