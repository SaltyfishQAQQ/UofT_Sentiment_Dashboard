It's publishing houses that do that, and they are the ones you should be directing your ire at.

Academics make very, very little off of textbook residuals.  The publishers make most of that money, and they are the ones that push for new editions every few years, not your instructors.  While there certainly are instructors that do push their own books as textbooks, anything that is an actual textbook typically has terrible markups.

For example, on a $100 textbook the bookstore probably only makes $10-$15 on that sale.  The publisher makes the rest, which then distributes a meager portion of that amount to the authors.  And the reason for that is textbooks have an extremely narrow demographic for sales.  They'll get sold maybe 3 times a year, if you're lucky, to maybe a couple thousand students unless it's a super famous textbook in that field.  Textbooks are essentially special print runs with a limited window for sale, to a very limited audience.

Like, yeah... be pissed about the scam of new editions and the prices, but direct that at the publishing companies that refuse to modernize their practices.  It's not your instructors/professors making these calls... it's the publishers.",comment,9
