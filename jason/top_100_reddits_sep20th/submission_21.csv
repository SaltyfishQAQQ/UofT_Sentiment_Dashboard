There was a suggestion box outside the dining room. The suggestion box was literally a box with a slot to insert suggestions regarding meals. Back then, probably on a weekly basis, one of the dinners was called, I kid you not, ‚Äúmystery meat.‚Äù It was like a meatloaf. Several people put suggestions in the suggestion box suggesting that the kitchen no longer serve mystery meat. But the kitchen kept serving the mystery meat until one day, when someone actually put their mystery meat in the suggestion box. Mystery meat was never served again.",comment,178
