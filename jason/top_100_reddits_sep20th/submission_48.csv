They said it's one of the few free spaces where they can practice dancing. Myhal has lots of empty space and the big windows let them see their reflections.

I don't think all dancers in Myhal are from the same group/place. I've seen Indian dancers and K-Pop dancers. That explains why other commenters have seen dancers since the late 2010s.",comment,13
