So there's quite some chance that your first year course is covering your high-school knowledge...... to a greater or lesser extent.

I might sound boasting, but trust me, your first year won't be that hard. As long as you put minimally acceptable effort into your classes, do lectures, you're not gonna flop.",comment,5

Then again itâ€™s different for every person. But exams are def trickier if ur profs are hard in the course, and if you get a good prof they sometimes linearly adjust (not a curve) the course grade (itâ€™s cuz they sometimes need to meet a certain avg)",comment,1

IIRC MAT 137 is legit just Grade 12 math with a little spin then that's it and not a lot of people failed or complained its hard....?

Never heard folks that say uoftears, but the only struggle I had was they squeeze all the assignments/exams in the same week, often back to back. So I would have exams in the morning, one at night and next day morning again.",comment,0

Instead what UofT does is linear adjustments. What are linear adjustments one may ask? Well if the class average is lower than usual the professor adds a couple points to everyone's mark up to a certain point (<= 100).,comment,14

I've seen people who have higher averages getting more extra marks in the curve before. It might be rare but it happens.,comment,2
