If you‚Äôre taking any of these courses at uoft next sem, these are most of my notes, practice questions, and flashcards that you're free to use if you want to check out each course and what you‚Äôll be learning.

I could be missing some stuff, so let me know or feel free to contribute! Would be cool to see others share their notes also.

Hope this helps :)
