Can yall NOT come to uni when yall are sick ??

I got sick last week AND CLASS JUST STARTED and now this week I’m feeling better I took a day off from classes to get better and now I’m in my class and at least 5 of yall are coughing sneezing out in the class ??? Please TAKE A DAY OR TWO OFF. If you are sick and coughing sneezing everywhere please STAY HOME. 

And to the nasty ppl who just leave the washroom and barely wash their hands, USE SOAP. actually Wash yourselves WASH YOUR BODIES TOO. Too much of yall stink. I am not trying to catch what yall have. 

Some of us have relatives who have health problems already and some of us have weak immune systems. We are not trying to get worse.

But “ya’ll” and “uni”? Two words I never hear in Canada. I can’t tell if you’re American or European.   

But whatevs, not as bad as the international students who sh*t then don’t wash their hands and don’t wear deodorant.  I get it.",comment,1
