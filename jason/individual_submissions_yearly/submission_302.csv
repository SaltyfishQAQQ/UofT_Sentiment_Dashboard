What should I do to stop being depressed and miserable as a Uoft Eng student?,RushImpossible9544,1hol6dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hol6dt/what_should_i_do_to_stop_being_depressed_and/,1735436933.0,"Hello there

I'm currently an ECE student at Uoft, and honestly ... I'm starting to regret my decision.

I came into Uoft with a lot of passion for technology and wanted to get a degree that would help me land a good paying job in the tech industry, but with how hard the curriculum of Uoft is, im starting to lose interest and wanting to give up.

There's a ton of workload, sometimes an unreasonable amount , and I often feel like i'm invisible and no one cares about me unless im an academically gifted person. I see everyone around me be successful while having tons of fun, whereas I struggle to keep up or have fun at all. It got to a point where a month before first semester exams I decided to stop going to school, missing lectures, tutorials, even some labs ... I just couldn't take it.

I know being depressed and stressed is normal for uoft students, but is this much really normal? what should I do to stop feeling miserable, and stop ruining my future?",submission,88

""nobody cares about you unless academically gifted"" -- yes, I've noticed being smart can somewhat substitute for a terrible personality, but only a little. people do not care about other people's grades that much, and after graduating nobody will ever care, ever.
2. ""everyone around you is successful and having fun"" -- I had like three ECE people break down in front of me personally this sem. craziest part is they seem pretty chill day-to-day. lots of people freak out internally, and a lot of them even stop going to class just like you did, so you just can't tell unless they hop in DM's.
3. ""being stressed and depressed is normal at uoft"" -- this is L mindset fabricated by the dark ECE shadow lords to bring down class averages, and I roll my eyes when hearing this. if you think you are ""supposed"" to be stressed out then of course you will be.

find something fun to do and do it every day for an hr or two. that should be enough to keep you sane. if it affects your grades a bit, who cares. someone else said work out, me personally find it boring as hell but if you aren't already exercising it may do the trick. or watch TV. or take walks. or get a cat... who knows. life\* > schoolwork.

What should I do to stop being depressed and miserable as a Uoft Eng student?,VenoxYT,m4ecrxu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hol6dt/what_should_i_do_to_stop_being_depressed_and/m4ecrxu/,1735499940.0,"Tbh being depressed isn't ""normal"" and you shouldn't think of it as that. Being stressed in some situations is a given, obviously near assessments and final exams people will be stressed. Theres thousands of dollars, four months of time, your grades and more on the line. So its natural for people to be at least a little stressed. However, if you're feeling stressed to the point where you see yourself having panic attacks, difficulty sleeping, feeling ""lazy"" or ""tired"" etc,. then its probably not normal. Seeing that you started to mass skip everything (which I did do in first-year but promptly realized its not worth it), you definitely need to talk with an advisor about lessening the work load. 

Academically gifted does get you fairly far in engineering, and probably in any program. If you're smart, people will want to associate themselves with you. But thats not always the case, I quite frankly don't even know the academic standing of most of my friends. Sure we banter a bit and maybe I hear they didn't perform so well on xyz, but idgaf, thats them. They're cool people so I really don't care what their academics are like. And if they seem to be interfering with my academics, I tell them straight up that I have things to do. 

  
Bluntly put, 

1/ Depression and constant state of panic/stress is *not* normal. You need to research into lessening the workload by either **switching into part-time** or adjusting your time-management skills (speak to an academic advisor). I personally would suggest part-time. I have friends who switched into part-time after first year,  and they are doing **much** better academically. Socially? Its a bit of a hit but not that much, you can always meet new people, they don't necessarily have to be in the same major or program or year as you. 

2/ The workload is hard, and don't think everyone else around you isn't also drowning. People have a really good skill at hiding their stress and how much they study. I seriously don't understand why, but its very obvious. They must think its embarrassing to say ""oh I studied like 10 hours for this"" so instead they will say ""oh I literally studied this morning im cooked"". Then when they end up with a pretty good mark, people around them will think of themselves as stupid. **Everyone I know, studies.** Including those who 4.0 courses and those who fail. If anyone says they didn't study for an exam or test, they are lying. You're in a program surrounded by nerds, don't forget.

3/ Put the phone away. Deadass, toss it away. Scrolling, watching youtube or Netflix, isn't gonna help ya man. I don't know what to say. I see mfrs who sit at a desk for 10 hours and get half the work I finish in 3 hours done. Then they are dumbfounded how people finish things so quickly and why they have no time. Turns out, from those 10 hours at least 4 hours were scrolling and getting distracted. The workload is hard, but if you sit down and actually work its not terrible. I never had to stay up past 11pm this year so far including before exams, tests, assignments etc,. You have to dedicate time solely to studying. If you find yourself slipping away and trying to distract yourself from work, just stop working, take a 15 min break, then come back. 

4/ Make good friends. Don't be desperate to the point where you just end up being friends with people who will drag you down. Everytime I feel unmotivated, I think of some of the shit my homies are up to and it gets me moving again. You never want your first line of contact to leave you down. And also on the topic of making friends, its not hard. Say ""hi"", get their instagram, everytime you see them give a wave or stop for a quick 5 min chat. If you see them in the pit or anywhere else, ask if you can sit and have lunch together. Unless you put in some effort, nothing will go anywhere man. I'm thankful I've been ""lucky"" to meet some nice peeps from APS111 and APS112 groups and even the lab groups in ECE110 231 241. Best way to meet someone new is through group-work - basically forced close-proximity.  Without friends, engineering is hard. If you're stuck on a question or homework assignment or maybe a topic. You want to at least have 2-3 people you can contact for help. Or you'll be sinking time in the gutter trying to figure it out yourself. 

I know its long, but it kinda sucks seeing people missing out on a good time in their early 20s/late-teens. Engineering is a fascinating degree and it shouldn't be something your depressed and fucked up trying to finish. Best of luck OP.",comment,6

I have jackshit on my resume and all of my friends are somehow working while doing ece and doing a billion hackathons while I'm struggling like crazy on school and can't even find the time to do a club. I was worried like crazy about having to redo the semester. I fell behind early on and stayed permanently behind and didn't have time to do anything. I lost my motivation and couldn't focus for the entire semester, never went to any non-mandatory class and just watched online lectures in my room. It was bad I was basically in solitary confinement and it got me really depressed. What I noticed however, is that if you really focus, I don't think anything is really ""hard"", it's just a time investment. People can do so much stuff cause they can focus (like actually focus) when they need to and manage their time really damn well. We have a crazy workload. Do not try to handle it alone. Spend some time working on things or studying with OTHER PEOPLE it really helps. You'll realize there's a lot more people that are struggling than you think and it keeps your mental health in check. And a big important thing. get rid of the fucking reels.",comment,5
