"Weird signs at Queenâ€™s park, some kind of project?",deleted,1gm7nfv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gm7nfv,1731031547.0,"I found these weird signs. Words are constantly misspelled or crosses out and random letters are capitalized. All in all it seems like a 9 year old did this. They were zip-locked to the benches too even. They seemed to ramble about issues in relation to social justice but I didnâ€™t read all of them. 

Anybody seen them or know what it is?",submission,30

White guy mid 40s. Very aggressive and follows people around shouting pretty terrible things. He's approached me twice now and gone on a wild rant.
