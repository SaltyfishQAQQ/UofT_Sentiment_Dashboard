(Unrelated, but inside Sidney Smith, thereâ€™s a super COOL and ABSURD PITCH BLACK ROOM that blew my mind bc I never expected such an unremarkable looking door to unlock something so strange) 

Anyway, has anyone been inside these rooms? Does the hype live up to the names. Please please let me know. Please. ",submission,22

Had a few meetings there years ago. It's just a regular room with white boards on one end and rows and rows of chairs for the audience infront of the boards plus some fancy tech for presentations.",comment,16
