For those who are wondering about STUDENT STORAGE,toadsuckss,1f8neb8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f8neb8/for_those_who_are_wondering_about_student_storage/,1725435367.0,"Since some of you are wondering about student storage, I decided to share some of my experiences with you guys. I used STORE YOUR DORM for the summer and it was my first time using these type of services and I didn't have the best time. They promised to redeliver my things on the 2nd sept but I waited for the whole day, no one contacted me, nothing arrived. I was so worried because I really needed my stuff for school since school was starting really soon. I called them a billion times and no one picked up. So my last resort was to email them, thank goodness they replied the next day and said one of their trucks got into an accident and therefore causing a delay in redelivery. I understood their situation but I think it is their responsibility to let me know that they aren't able to redeliver my things on the scheduled date. I was extremely worried for the whole day as they didn't give me any updates until I emailed them a billion times as well. I got my stuff back finally the next day and when I unpacked, one of my boxes were half unsealed and some of my things broke. Including my mug which was wrapped in layers of bubble wrap. Some of my clothes were also wet. Anyway I did not have the best experience with them and so I hope that my experience will give yall some insight when choosing which student storage to book with. I am definitely booking with a new storage company next year. ",submission,27

Hopefully your clothes were only recently wet because would suck to have your clothes go moldy with the moisture.

For any first year student on res it would be a good idea to plan to think about where to move your stuff in March because many residence boot you out right as exams ends and you won'thave time then depending on your courses. 

Personally I had a pretty decent experience with xyz storage in their downtown location with their smallest storage, although it was slightly far from my res. They allowed me to go get their stuff at pretty much anytime as well. The pricing was relatively cheap from what I could remember. As for transport, I used uberXL to move my stuff mainly because I didn't have that much stuff and wanted to save costs.",comment,3

I'm so sorry. If it helps, I used Storagehotel this summer and I recommend you use them next year. They picked up and delivered my boxes on time and always kept me updated through email and phone. I received all my items back without any damage. Hope this helps!!
