The circle is the front of the historical campus and the astro-turf field behind UC is the back campus. No one is trying to play games by calling it front campus -- that's simply what it's historically known as.

I also find the claim that no one uses front campus a bit odd. I always tell people never to cut across the grass because it'll be either too wet, too icy or there will be way too many people throwing things for sport-related purposes. People use that space. It was under construction to expand its use to the community. This can be true and you can feel the occupation was called for and had a right to occupy the space.

**inb4** ppl claiming it's ""collateral damage,"" inform yourself about the war crimes perpetuated by the IDF.


**EDIT:** And people like /u/CheetohChaff comparing human suffering to fake internet points ü•¥ How tone-deaf.


**EDIT 2:** You need some reading comprehension, /u/CheetohChaff . I said grass is unimportant compared to the cause that damaged it. You tried to rebut it by alluding to some supposed ""negative [personal] impact"" being important to me compared to other ""things currently happening in the world."" Since we are arguing the opposite and you are the only one suggesting fake internet points matter over human suffering, you should understand how you come off as tone-deaf.


**EDIT 3:** /u/CheetohChaff , you _are_ aware that the grass was killed during protests against the murder of unarmed civilians and children, right? Or are you just learning about the encampment? Because you using ""the same argument"" makes no sense if you did. Like, did your supposed ""negative [personal] impact"" help you somehow advocate for ""things currently happening in the world""? If you feel it did, then cool. Go for it.


**EDIT 4:** /u/CheetohChaff , so? It's easy for you to say from your armchair that a protest is only worthwhile if there are results. Imagine telling this to the early Civil Rights movement protesters. ""Dude, you accomplished nothing (except awareness and having people start seriously consider your demands), so it was all pointless ü•¥""

I'm not ""arguing the opposite"" (and for the record, I never said that internet points or grass were more important than genocide). Either you're being very disingenuous or *you* need to improve *your* reading comprehension.

The point of my comment was to criticize your style of argument. You're saying that if B (genocide) is much worse than A (killing grass) then A is fine, and that doesn't make any sense. I showed that by using the same argument to arrive at a ridiculous conclusion.",comment,-1

I would run Camp U of T programs during the summer there when I was a student. My friends and I loved playing spikeball there. Just because you think there's no use to it doesn't make it true. It's not your right to decide what can and can't be done there or what reason's are most valid/appropriate. 

My point is the options of doing any of things listed above and more have been taken away for a while now because others thought their reasons were the most important.",comment,6
