Ended up doing well at the end of first year, and still had some sort of a friend group despite joining no clubs. I thought this was just the UofT experience, and to do well here meant a little bit of sacrifice. But everything changed in second year. 

I met overachievers in my classes. People with 3.9 to 4.0 GPAs who somehow could balance multiple research positions, hobbies, sports, social lives, partying, going on nice vacations, concerts and still retained their personalities. All of them were doing better than me academically. Meanwhile I was tirelessly trying to get internships, research positions and a 4.0 by quitting the gym, quitting playing sports, quitting playing instruments, deleting my social media, quitting my gaming addiction and was still worse off GPA wise and career building wise. Whenever these overachievers start talking about academics or career or their personal lives, I fall into a deep depression and they all know i'm the stupid one with no clubs, social life, work experience and still lower grades, and I can feel them judging me quietly. Plus my friend group has pretty much collapsed on itself, so I have no one to talk to this about. 

Are these people just born gifted to be better than me in every way? Do I give up on the 4.0 and try to get all my hobbies back or put my head down and lock in? If anybody else is going through something similar please tell me what the f im supposed to do. ",submission,151

In terms of people being better off, I find that everyone only shows off the best version of their story to others. 

Like, I have an on-campus job, respectable number of EC’s, but an average-below avg engineering GPA (Think 2.5-3.0) and that’s only because I dropped a course (almost dropped 2) in first year and retook in summer.

 People have told me they think I’m put together and smart because I’m doing/balancing so much. When I hear that, I’m like “??? Don’t bet on it lmfao”. The reason you think specific people are doing better than you is because it’s all a facade. Nobody talks about the things they’re not proud of, and that’s not an incentive to go searching for it 

Just accept that you’re not perfect. And nobody wants, or expects you to be perfect either. I think you should be proud. Your achievements didn’t come easily to you, but they’re yours. I have come around to being proud of my first year gpa, even when, if I was a different person, I would look at it in slight horror and self judgement.  

And I think the key is to keep working hard, but not put yourself down in the process. We’re all on a tiny rock in the vast universe. You’re a miracle, and you’re putting yourself down for not meeting university/academic/general career-wise status at a known competitive school.

Go look at the Fall colours and call your parents. Even if you aren’t, so many people (including me of course) would hear your story and be proud of you 

Also sorry for the essay, I don’t know where it came from. I sometimes fall into bouts of comparison depression as well but this is what I’ve come to learn makes me motivated to work, grow, and helps me look forward to my studies even when I’m swamped in work",comment,122

Everyone have their own journey. This way, you will only feel burnout .Believe me, I learned this the worst way possible .I made my life a hell, but then I learned that if I don't stop comparing, I can never enjoy the good things happening in my life .Believe me, my life has been so peaceful since I stopped comparing. 

So , take a deep breath and then think .
It's never too late . Do you want clubs?  why don't you join the clubs  that are related to your hobby? Like a sports club or a gym or health related club . Never give up on hobbies. Instead, work on your hobbies that's a part of your personality. 

Believe me, you don't need 200 frndz , don't feel sad about that .Having one  quality friend is enough
I am also in second year, and I have only one friend she is the same major as me,so our hangouts are more like study sessions, lol . I was a part of multiple  big friend groups in my first year but  still used to feel lonely, lol  .So ,go for quality and don't feel sad about it",comment,36

- be mindful of your time and mental effort when studying. not everything is worth looking into, focus on the important stuff, ESPECIALLY if it requires a lot of brainpower. people forget that mental energy is a resource that is as important as time is, your brain isn't a machine that can just work 24/7. 

- you can learn to learn! from what I've seen interacting with a bunch of different kinds of students is that many students that are smart not only figure out things quickly when they're presented with information, they often also have good techniques when it comes to studying. it may not be feasible to try and acquire raw intelligence, but it's definitely worth it to try and figure out study techniques that work for you. you can find material online about this, but the most important thing is to apply it to yourself and note down the things that work for you, and try to build a system around it

- take care of your mental and physical health. this stuff may not seem important, but every little bit adds up and it's much easier to learn when you're feeling physically well. get lots of sleep, water, and don't skip the gym entirely. a bit of short exercise two or three times a week genuinely helps a LOT. especially for sleep, it's hard to emphasize how much this makes a difference and I genuinely cannot understand why anyone would give up sleep to study more

- relax a bit! based on what you're describing right now, it doesn't seem like you lack work ethic or have trouble staying disciplined. you don't become an academic weapon overnight, the people that you mention often have had years of experience keeping up with academics as well as extracurriculars and their personal life. the fact that you've made this switch in priorities so recently and are still doing well is a good sign

- personal tip for studying as well is to realize how deep of an understanding you need in a specific topic, memorization vs true understanding requires different approaches. you can find great tips for both everywhere, but for hard concepts I'd personally recommend to take occasional breaks where you're not focused on a specific task just so you can think about a topic. maybe take a walk, step out on a balcony, or even just stare outside or something and give your brain a bit of time to process the thoughts you're having. if you still can't get it after a 10-30 minutes, no worries. study a little bit of one topic every day or even with a couple hours break in between, it's much easier especially for harder concepts compared to trying to think nonstop until you get it completely. this is why i emphasize sleep a lot as well, your brain does a looot of processing while you aren't awake and I find that at least personally, I don't have nearly as much of that overnight boost in understanding if I don't sleep well. 

good luck out there! 🤞",comment,3

I personally know many people who are smarter than myself and I'm sure they think the same about themselves. there are plenty of people outside of uoft who will think your life is together because you go to school to begin with. it's a big chain of command, the only thing that matters is whether you're inspired to move up it or wallowing in despair.

If someone actually judges you because you worked extra hard and made sacrifices for your good grades, they are the ones who have issues, not you. 

Also, one word of advice: what appears to be the case with what you see/hear from the others may not actually be the truth. Everyone has their own struggles, and just because they don't talk about them, it doesn't mean they don't exist. Always take it with a grain of salt when you listen to these amazing career inspirations/stories, especially the ones who are giving off the vibes of 'superiority'. The most talented people I knew from this school barely had time to show off and were just too busy and tired minding their own business, and when you actually talked to them you realized that they were some of the nicest and down to earth people.",comment,1

Don't allow other people's supposed judgement (which is probably your fleeting impression of a few fleeting impressions of you) to determine how you conduct your life. 

But be smart about it. You can have a healthy social life and still excel at school, even if you're not extraordinarily talented. In fact, having a gratifying social life - at least from time to time - is the best way to excel at school. You want to stay turned on and stimulated so that you don't completely burn out. That does not mean partying all the time.

At the end of the day, don't blame your classmates for your decisions. Enjoying your life while doing your best to succeed will take you far. But it's a long game. Many don't make it for lack of heart.",comment,1

2. They may have VERY efficient study methods. 
-pay attention in class write down EVERY WORD the teacher says and question! This will make it so you don’t need to study as much outside of class. 
-effective study habits (Anki, obsidian etc) 
3. Lifestyle factors 
- on campus meal plans can suck, but they can also be extremely efficient and save you a lot of time from cooking. 
-location of residence, not having to commute can save you a lot of time.
-living at home (if the people you are comparing yourself to live at home, they are living in a different world less responsibility, chores financial stress etc) 

Final thoughts: There are many ways to be more productive. Focus on what you can do and don’t compare yourself too much to others, there is a very small chance. You understand all the nuances in their lives.

In HS I did so well, but also felt the pressure to do better than everyone. And when I didn't, it bummed me out. And it got my crazy competitive tendencies going. Then I get to UofT Engineering, and very quickly realized, ""Shit, it doesn't matter what I do it how hard I try, I am never going to be top of class."" There was always going to be a group of people that is just more overall capable. And at a place like UofT, it's not a small group. And it just kind of took the pressure off. I still tried hard and set high goals, but I stopped comparing myself to crazies at the top.
