"To those blokes who I wrongly accused of being mobsters, I am mortified and I owe you my life lmfao",deleted,1dgyp73,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dgyp73/to_those_blokes_who_i_wrongly_accused_of_being/,1718508480.0,"At around 10 pm today, right next to SMC, I witnessed about 10 angry-looking dudes shoving a terrified, panicking man into a car, which drove off with him in it. I and a bunch of other witnesses called 911, and I chose to wait in the area for the police to come. When the police came, I told them everything that I saw. 


About an hour after I talked to the police, they called me, and gave me an update. It was all just one big misunderstanding. The 10-ish men were all friends of that panicky guy, and the panicky dude was actually having a psychotic episode. The reason they all shoved him into the car was so that he could be driven home to his parents LMFAO. Ahhhhhh I am mortified. If I see those men again, I will pay them one million dollars.",submission,1065
