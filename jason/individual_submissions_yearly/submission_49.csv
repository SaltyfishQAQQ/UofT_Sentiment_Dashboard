The second intifada was not entirely peaceful but you cannot say it also was unprovoked. Intifada, root word An- Ta- Fa - Da means to shake off.. so global iterations of Intifada meant revolt against oppression, the first and second intifada in Palestine was in protest to isreali violence … in what way is this kill all jews? 

Now a question for you, do you keep this same energy, especially given you don’t have to depend on convoluted and purposefully manipulated meaning of words, when people say “ Do another Nakba?”",comment,-1

Its obviously not an easy situation but this narrative that ""Israel bad"" is ridiculous when you're comparing them to legitamite islamist terrorists.

I'm not sure what war crimes you refer to becauze those have very specific definitions. If anything Israel should be commended for their low civilian casualty rate (roughly 1:1) which is unheard of in modern urban conflict. The US Army trains with Israel on how to mitigate civilian casualties.

The mental gymnastics of those in the west to come to the conclusion that Israel, which has an arab population of roughly 21% is enacting a genocide against Arabs when Gaza, the west Bank, and surrounding Arab countries have a Jewish population of 0% is quite impressive. I wonder what happened to them? It's almost as if they were displaced... Yet there was no outrage over that because people love to hate Jews. 

There is no easy solution, but perhaps if the Arab world with millions of Sq km of land and plenty of oil money helped their brethren with humanitarian means and not turning them into human shields to achieve their antisemitic agendas we could see real progress in the region.",comment,9
