Tips and reflection from a graduate student who is done,alwayshungryandcold,1coz6ix,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1coz6ix/tips_and_reflection_from_a_graduate_student_who/,1715372612.0,"Take it for what it's worth but here are some things I have learnt from 9 years of grad school and undergrad that I wish someone told me, of course take it in context and they are not 100% true at all times in all contexts

1. the institution is actually apathetic toward most things. It controls your life to some degree and will do things you disagree with or make you do it, just accept it. You'll leave one day. The 'real world' is not always better anyway.
2. Most of your instructors and TAs are also apathetic. Some are mean, some are nice. That is not the same as competent or helpful. If you can find a prof or TA or whatever who is actually invested in you or your success. Keep in touch with them. It's easy, just schedule a coffee chat every year or something. Most students forget about the prof when the class ends so the helpful profs are usually happy to keep in touch. Similar ideas apply to your classmates. Many are nice, some are annoying, a few you actually will benefit from spending time with after graduation. You will meet brillant classmates as well. Learn as much as you can from them.

2a) Many profs are made to be leaders when they don't have leadership skills or training. Many of them wish they weren't leaders. Remember that when they do something you disagree with.

3) Stop complaining about stress and lack of social life and do something about it. Hart House is a great place to meet new ppl outside your department you won't meet otherwise and to learn new skills in the meantime. Truly one of the things I will miss about UT.

4) Your employer probably does not care about your research or course grades unless you are extemely talented or extremely incompetent (and of course if you wanna work in academia). They care even less that you went to one of the best school in the world.

5) Make your own opportunities. The school will not hand them to you on a platter. Many of the opportunities I got came from outside university.

6) your employer probably wants skills, knowledge is much easier to learn once you're in

7) Many things you try will fail, just do better next time

8) Grades can be quite arbitrary. As a STEM person, I have got C's in courses I worked extremely hard in and As in course that I didn't study for before writing the exam. I wrote a paper where my TA said if she graded it, would have given me enough marks to bump me up a letter grade. Too bad someone else marked it.

9) enjoy the ridiculous moments. I had a friend in undergrad who corrected the prof multiple times in front of the class because the prof didn't know what he was talking about and tried to pretend he did. Still makes me smile. Many profs are not here for their knowledge or expertise but for something else.

10) Many who are here don't deserve to be here. Many who are not here deserve to be here.

11) Milk your student status for what it's worth. Coffee chats with professionals who would not talk to strangers otherwise. Student discounts? Free food? It only last for a few years.

12) Attending class is optional. Learning is not. You all know the classes where the instructor wastes your time. Don't complain you didn't learn. You're in university. Learn to teach yourself. It's a lifelong skill that will pay back dividends.

13) If you ever become a TA or a prof. Be the person you wish they were to you.

14) always ask if a job people want you to do is paid or compensated.

15) beware of exaggerations and people who contribute to them. Tends to happen in university in a covert manner. Also beware of ppl who like to simplify complex issues.

16) Don't reject opportunities, but also learn to say no. Both to others and to yourself. Your time becomes more valuable the older you get. At the same time, be more efficient with your time.

17) Always try your best. But sometimes that means giving up on something else. Somethings are not worth doing

18) There many different forms of knowledge. What you learn in university classes is only one type of knowledge.

19) Most of what you do here doesn't matter in the end. You will probably forget about it a year from now.

20) If you are not uncomfortable with something new you are probably not learning enough. Similarly, if you are one of the smartest persons in the room, you might benefit from leaving.

21) Help your fellow student, even if they won't/can't repay you, even if it leaves you at a disadvantage. Think back to people who did the same for you

22) Don't go home immediately when class ends. You'll miss the university experience for what it's worth. Much of your learning takes place outside the classroom.

23) Fair is not just, just is not fair. Don't let either stop you from doing the right thing.

24) If you have nothing to do, sleep or exercise. Those are rarely wastes of time.

25) Be open to criticism of yourself, both from others and yourself

26) be humble. I had a prof who made fun of arts students constantly since they have a reputation for being bad at math. Turns out the prof couldn't do 1st year stats to save their life. I have friends with BAs who published in CS and Science journals. I have friends with BAs that STEM profs ask for help from with software and technology. Think ML and GIS

27) if ppl want you to spend time with you, they will usually let you know

28) work sucks. Start it early anyway 

29) it's easy to complain. Find a reason to smile and be thankful instead. Be comfortable with being uncomfortable ",submission,281

This is the shit that I wish I knew before jumping into academia, or wish I learned much earlier in my career.

2 is really big. Students should try to establish a professional or friendly with your profs and TAs after the course, if appropriate. They can help you in other facets of school and life. I became good friends with some of my students from previous courses that I TA'd. Occasionally, they would ask me to help them with some code, to give comments on their papers, to give them life/career advice. I even co-authored one of my previous student's paper because I helped them with the stats/code. In return, they carry me in valorant, belay me while rock climbing, pay for my drink at the pub, or some other mundane thing that you can expect from a friend.",comment,5

That gives a reason to stay in contact. Going to the community centre to do classes is an example of this. You see the same ppl once or twice a week in a non stressful setting for a few months. Ppl are more friendly when they want to be somewhere rather than being told to be there,comment,10

U sound awesome. I have a few undergrads I work with that I'm friendly with but we never got very close. 

Also glad to see what I said makes sense from another grad student's experience! This was a way for me to cope with some less than ideal news from ut so I'm happy my points weren't nonsense, rants or overly obvious stuff.",comment,2

I do think the more honest a prof is the better they are usually. For example I had a prof who confessed they fell into academia accidentially and they never wanted to pursue it and profs who told me to find other paths besides academia since they would not do it if they could redo their life. I also had profs who straight up apologized for not being engaging in class but that he was going for lessons to try and improve. One of my undergrad profs told me straight up that grad school was not useful and to try something else. She still wrote my reference letter and I got in, and of course, we are still in contact :D. I contrast these types of profs with those who talk about how difficult it was for them to make it in academia and the odds were stacked against them etc etc. I find these types are usually more disorganized as well. I still think fondly of the profs in the 1st category even if I didn't do well in their courses because they tend to be the ones who give you resources to succeed. I leave meetings with them feeling energized and knowing what to do. I do find it hopeful that the best researchers do tend to fall into the first category. The second category tends to be more interested in creating rhetoric to paint themselves in a better light or to just concentrate on their own work. It's hard to get ahold of them for meetings and if I try and get help from them, I don't leave the meeting feeling confusing without any direction. I had a prof where it took a literal week to schedule a 30 minute meeting 1 month from now since his schedule apparently kept changing and then a week later he said he had to reschedule again.",comment,5

I made a few friends I hope to keep and networked with a few cool professionals. I suppose another takeaway is my above points and that researchers at the top schools are not always super human. It's encouraging cos you see that anyone can do it and scary that you realize actually there aren't that many actual geniuses to save us. You also learn more about yourself and what you can and cannot do and what you should and shouldn't do.,comment,2
