I got 99th percentile of provincial and SAT exams, also did well in IB. Of course they don't mean nothing in the grand scheme of things but it still was a ""signal"" towards my academic strengths. 

Coming to U of T I did really badly in my math courses. I realized I wasn't cut out for cs/stats and actually dropped to econ early 2nd year. 

One thing I notice is a huge gap between being ""pretty good"" at something and making a career out of it. I actually left U of T, and learned very little. The uni experience also killed my self esteem as I felt that I had nothing to offer in terms of career skills and also felt like I wasn't that smart enough to go into a particular discipline such as law/medicine/engineering/CS.

It was humbling in a way as I realize there is HUGE gap between being pretty good at something vs making a career out of it. Kind of like how kids who go to college for sports but most don't make it ya know? 

Obviously athletics is much harder but I feel like in the modern economy, I almost feel like an athlete competing against everyone against these jobs. There is no room for mediocrity with so many people going to college now. 

I can't help but feel lost finding my place in this world. All these job postings are so specialized and not sure where to even go as an ""average"" student. ",submission,50

I’m doing much better at UofT than when I was in high school. The people in my high school were constantly outperforming me. While I was also a 99ish percentiler, I always did bad compared to the other kids in my class.
This is just my opinion, but maybe try to do things with an actual interest instead of doing them for the “need” or to “prove yourself”. And lower your ego a bit and ask for help. Yes math is hard, but I feel like I actually developed a better love for it here than in high school. I don’t know though, it might not be the experience of everyone here so I’d love to hear some other thoughts.",comment,7
