‚Äútop‚Äù programs like mac health sci, queens commerce, etc. are not attracting top students, at least with (what i believe to be) the right definition of ‚Äútop‚Äù. you want to be surrounded by high ability, inquisitive people that have a passion for doing real, impactful work, not leeches whose whole life revolves around memorizing powerpoint slides, ‚Äúnetworking‚Äù and leading 50 useless clubs to pad their cv for med school. or whose biggest aspiration is getting a job at goldman to make powerpoints and edit excel sheets for 100 hours a week. not to say those don‚Äôt exist here, but don‚Äôt confuse such programs with ‚Äútop‚Äù students",comment,24
