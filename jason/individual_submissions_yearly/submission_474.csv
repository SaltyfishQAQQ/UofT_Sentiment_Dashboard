This school transformed me so much, and I feel something inside me is gone. I've worked really hard for the last three years and got most of the things I wanted, but the idea that in September I'm no longer an undergrad is just very weird for me. Life is so fast. I have two months before grad school starts, how do I prepare myself mentally? Does anyone feel the same???",submission,50

When you're in exam mode, your norepinephrine/dopamine/acetylcholine systems are on overdrive, now you've de-mobilized with nothing to do and feel uber bored. What you can do is just study something else that is useful like finance and health, and hit up the gym. I noticed no brutal transitions when I do this. Find a hobby to use those neurotransmitters lol. We're all bags of chemicals. Check out Dr. Andrew Huberman on this stuff, talks about it all the time. Life is long lol, so just keep up good actions that'll make a better tomorrow for you, cuz there will be a lot of tomorrow's barring freak bad luck.",comment,39

If you are planning on doing grad school at UofT (and did your undergrad here too), then I recommend you start scouting out the resources and facilities that are available to you as a grad student. Learn about the parts of UofT that you missed out on because you were too focused on studying as an undergrad student (e.g., writing workshops, gym, clubs, graduate student unions, etc.).",comment,3

Couldnâ€™t wait to finish exams, and then had like 2 weeks of pure dread and anxiety thinking Iâ€™d fail a course or my avg would be below a 60 and Iâ€™d have to repeat 4th year cause of that, and then since I passed everything Iâ€™ve just been happy. Started work, getting into the 9-5 habit, looking to move out of my parents place. 

If I wasnâ€™t working Iâ€™d be traveling probably. Try that. Doesnâ€™t have to be fancy could just be weekend camping trips or something.",comment,2

Doesn't sound like what you're going through but point being, the fear of no longer being a student is a typical experience because you lose the community and structure you're used to in school. It makes you realize that life does indeed move fast and it only feels like yesterday that you just entered university. It's a learning curve, adapting to life after graduation. If you want to see firsthand what others felt after graduating, you may find GradSimple (newsletter) helpful! Every week, you get to see interviews of university/college grads talk about how they're adapting to life afterwards. People talk about what major they took, their job search experience, and what they're doing now. It could give a lot of perspective and maybe even a bit of comfort since you're about to graduate soon! Know that you're not alone in how you feel.",comment,2

I would say that's my natural cycle if you remove work/school obligations and left me to my own devices. You can use melatonin to regulate your sleep cycle, and you control it by your wake time, and not sleeping during the daytime. Exercise will help as well, especially weights, that'll knock you out at night from the serotonin-->melatonin conversion? Do see a doctor if you suspect something off though and get medical advice from there lol, not Reddit.",comment,2
