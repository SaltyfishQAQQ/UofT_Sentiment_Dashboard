First, as is clear in the title, I don’t want to debate the issue that the current encampment is protesting against and demanding disclosure/divestments.

If you are someone who does not support divestment from a specific cause, or opposes divestment in principle, I believe you can still support a demand for full disclosure of the university’s investments in a regular and accessible manner. 

I think it’s reasonable to say that every member of the UofT community has a right to know where the university is investing its money. As an institute of research and higher education, I believe the university should hold itself to the principles of freedom of information and transparency that are such an integral part of a democratic governance system and academic work. 

Money is power; it is one of the most powerful tools to exert influence/pressure on social, political, and economic issues. The university investing its money in causes/industries that are detrimental is thus equivalent (if not more impactful) to a full-throated endorsement of the cause/industry. For an issue that has more of a consensus in the community, please check out this [report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tHaYgQuaLOoE9z6yNcMxASwQJIhhEqDX/view) by Climate Justice UofT on the ties the university has to the fossil fuel industry.

So, the point I’m trying to make is that disclosure is not only reasonable, but imperative under the principles and values that we hold dear in academic institutions, regardless of your own views on any specific issue or which side of the issue you are on. Knowing where the university “votes with its wallet” is a bare minimum level of information freedom that can be then followed by debate or discussion within the community.

I’ll quickly mention and respond to some of the counterarguments I can think of and will be happy to discuss this further in the comments:

**1-**  **Disclosing investments will hurt the university’s finances and its competitiveness.**

I don’t disagree with the premise or conclusion of this argument. Yes, the university might be negatively affected if it can’t invest in profitable, yet detrimental industries like most other universities do, due to pressure from its community or the accountability brought about by transparency. But, that is essentially arguing that “we can’t win if we don’t play dirty like everyone else”. 

2-  **Disclosing investments will increase the risk of protest on campus**

Again, no disagreement here. But I would argue that minimizing protest by keeping people in the dark is incredibly undemocratic and not acceptable, especially when a portion of the university’s income comes from students paying tuition. 

What do you think about this issue?",submission,152

I've always found it odd that universities, as publicly funded private institutions, get to use their investment dollars behind a thicker veil than many pension funds. I've researched the part of U of T's investment history, but that was very much early twentieth-century stuff. Nonetheless, it was quite an administrative process to get that information, which was weird considering that for any other institution taking public money, a freedom of information request can go a long way quickly and without too much hassle.

Regardless of the issue at hand, universities should have just as much transparency as provincial ministries regarding pretty much everything, so it's a no-brainer for me to support any and all policies that help demystify things. Now, as to the finer points of protesting university investments, I think it's fine to an extent, but it could easily slide into unproductive protests. Seeing investments in a mining firm could reasonably trigger a lot of backlashes; however, depending on the company, you could literally be protesting an extraction process that is essential for the buildings your courses are in or, more mundanely, the technology you use to learn from electronics to lab equipment. Divestment only ever makes so much sense in a world where there are many problems with many industries and the countries they inhabit, so I would argue that asking universities to behave as activist investors to improve issues with certain sectors is a more productive course of action.",comment,50

This includes investments in in Israeli weapons manufacturing which are known to sell weapons that are ‘battlefield tested’ on Palestinians before being sold, university admins have already admitted to these students that they do have investments in weapons manufacturing.

They also want UofT to cut ties with Israeli universities, including joint programs and sponsored trips to Israel. They’ve been working on this for years as Israeli universities have direct ties to the IDF and IOF, develop weapons for them and suppress and harass academics in Israel who speak out against the various human rights abuses committed by the IDF, IOF and Israeli government. These calls intensified since October, as UofT maintained ties to these universities while Israel has directly targeted and destroyed every single university in Gaza, obliterating the region’s entire educational infrastructure. The president claimed last month that he wasn’t even aware that not a single university has been left standing in Gaza, something that should have raised outcry from academic institutions all over the world as an attack on academia. Just yesterday, Israeli soldiers posted pictures of the university libraries being set on fire.

Now it might seem like pointless, UofT is only one university, what can it do? But efforts like these start small and the there have been several student protests at universities all over the world with a goal of disclosure and divestment from businesses and institutions that enable and profit from Israel’s oppression and genocide of Palestinians. To isolate Israel and pressure them into stopping the genocide, allow Palestinians the right to return (under current law, anyone who practises Judaism or comes from Jewish descent can come to Israel and claim citizenship but once Palestinians leave the area, they are forbidden from returning) and to also give them equal rights under law. Currently, Jewish Israelis are subject to one set of laws tried in a civil court while non Jewish and/or Palestinian people are subject to a different set of laws and are tried in a military court even though they are civilians.

Similar tactics are what finally led to the end of apartheid in South Africa. Similar to how Palestinians are treated, black South Africans were discriminated against and were subject to a different set of laws than their white counterparts. Due to pressure from various organizations and university students, governments and universities cut ties with South Africa, isolating the country from the rest of the world and forcing them to succumb to the pressure and repeal the apartheid laws.

Currently, most of Gaza’s remaining alive population is concentrated in Rafah, the southern most region in Gaza after being told to evacuate from the north if the strip multiple times by the idf, they claimed Rafah would be a safe zone. This zone is now being invaded by the IDF, countless civilians have been killed by missile strikes in residential areas and refugee camps. The urgency caused by this combined by the fact that convocation at UofT is in less than two weeks (they want a nice empty lawn to take pretty convocation pictures) is creating lots of tension between the encampment organizers and the university admin, leading to the email sent out earlier today by Gertler that can be boiled down to ‘we’ll consider your demands and will probably deny them, but you should still leave’.

Edit: I also want to add that several universities around the world have successfully met student demands and began to cut ties with Israel, including University of Barcelona, Dutch Royal Academy of Art, National Autonomous University of Mexico, etc. The encampmemt's demands are not impossible. UofT has the dishonour of being one of the last universities in the world that cut ties with South Africa against the apartheid, but they eventually did. They can cut ties with Israel too.",comment,13

Only up the point that it aligns with ethics and values. 

Students protested for divestment of fossil fuels a decade ago. Meric appointed a committee to consider fossil fuel divestment, which DID recommend it, and he essentially vetoed their recommendation until more recently (this is why the current protestors believe he's given them an offer in bad faith).

“In October of 2021, we pledged to divest the endowment portfolio from holdings in fossil fuel companies, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions associated with the endowment portfolio by 2050, and to allocate 10 per cent of the endowment portfolio’s assets to sustainable and low-carbon investments by 2025,” President Gertler said.

The governing council consists of many many stakeholders of the university including students and alumni. This is not a private for-profit corporation. All of these stakeholders have a right to know what their community is contributing to.

When it comes to research, grad students and professors that produce the research (the product in your apparently very material world view). As a grad student myself, my research funding (including my salary) are paid almost entirely by an NSERC grant and my supervisor procured, and two grants donated by alumni donors that I applied to and won, which the university then took >50% of and I received about 40%.

I think it would give us more moral standing if we were transparent, and that's an advantage.

I think it would be more challenging to mitigate the conflicts of interest that are exposed; we'd have to create structures to oversee administrative approvals and to challenge decisions. (Example: We might reasonably be able to expect that an individual researcher can examine and publish work critical of or exposing shortcomings in a source that the university (not the individual) is invested in. However, what happens when that researcher asks the university for support when they apply for grant funding? Or when they request approval to spend funds in pursuit of a project that might be contrary to the university's financial interests? How do we know that rejections or a lack of support are not motivated by that conflict? At the moment, those administrators *don't know*, so there isn't a conflict.)

I also think that there is the potential for our work to be dismissed -- or, more likely, criticized -- as being biased if it we publish work that is aligned with our financial relationships.

Overall, I don't know if it makes our work easier or more effective. But I think that the kind of arms-length (zero knowledge) investment structure we use is fairly common when there are concerns about bias. There's a reason why politicians are encouraged to put their finances in the hands of a third party, as one example.",comment,1

“Nonprofits run with the purpose of maximizing revenues for the causes they support. Not-for-profits do not run with the goal of earning revenue, and any money earned has to go back into the organization itself.” ([Source](https://www.shopify.com/ca/blog/non-profit-vs-for-profit#)) 

I used “not for profit” to explain that domestic tuition does not have the goal of earning revenue (more money). If I am using these commonly used  terms, international tuition acts more like how they describe “non profit” where they’re maximizing revenue. 

My original comment just said international tuition is different. Which is true if we are using the commonly used terms of non profit and not for profit.  I did not use the words for profit, that was what you assumed.

Plus, academically speaking, UofT has an outstanding reputation, people want to go here because it’s a good school.
