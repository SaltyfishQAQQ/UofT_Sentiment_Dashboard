I think this forum can handle and support student entrepreneurship. But I definitely donâ€™t think it should be open to any other advertising or shilling. 

Maybe require a photo of student card with last name and number blocked out, and selfie on campus, and one in front of the McDonalds in the Frye building basement. 

Then they can advertise a business they created. What you think?",comment,7

I'm not associated with any brands or organizations outside of my own and the school. I can prove my status if needed! Also, I'm just trying to spread some dessert/pastry joy :D


I've made a previous post that didn't get flagged and attracted attention from the Centre for Entreneurship at the Arts and Science Faculty, so I thought I'd go for another one with the holidays coming up. I apologize if I've broken any rules, and will take the posts down if necessary.Â ",comment,1

I just donâ€™t want it to open the door to spam/ads not connected to uoft.  Which is why itâ€™s not allowed. But I think you make a great example of why there should be some exceptions.,comment,6
