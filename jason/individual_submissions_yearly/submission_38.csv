The issue here is that UofT is essentially adjacent to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario, and is not too far away from the financial hub of Toronto. Even if the university administration wanted to, there's very little chance that something like this will be given the go-ahead in this city, at least not beyond a weekend.

Maybe if it was York or Waterloo it might be different, but there's just no way the Toronto police are going to let a bunch of students take over downtown Toronto. It's not a question of morality or causes, it's purely a question of how the Toronto police treats these sort of things.

Honestly, I kinda starting hope that the entire thing goes ahead just so that the obvious outcome can happen, and we can start getting past the horror and shock that the real world can be violent and terrifying. I've literally had people arguing with me that the Toronto police would just stand back and let it happen, and that's just straight up cute.",comment,12

I'm not participating in the protest, but these are all reasonable to me. Students got U of T to divest from fossil fuels, why not divest from military good and services?

Disclosing investments is something all students would benefit from. Transparency should be an aim for all.

The third demand targets breaking ties with institutions that even Canada recognizes are operating against international law.

Israel is bracing itself for the possibility that the International Criminal Court could issue criminal warrants against Netanyahu and members of the IDF for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes. Asking U of T to stop investing in genocide seems reasonable.",comment,9

that the protests became an “occupation” as of the first Saturday. The protesters had,
in effect, been invited to park their trucks for the weekend in various locations in the
downtown core. By Monday, however, when they refused to leave, the invitation was
clearly revoked. **In addition, it was clear that the assembly was no longer peaceful,
given the widespread intimidation of residents and the fact that their ability to live and
work had been fundamentally disrupted.** It was apparent that the police were unable
to control the protest and limit unlawful conduct in the protest area.

> [...]

> At the same time, I am also satisfied that **the organizers did not do all they could to
limit the amount of violence and harassment.** Mr. Barber and Ms. Lich both testified
that they were not in favour of the constant honking, but they took no meaningful
steps to stop it. To the contrary, organizers opposed the injunction sought by Zexi Li to
restrict honking. In addition, at times, **Mr. Barber and Mr. King posted videos and other
content where they appeared gleeful about the harm being inflicted on downtown
residents. At the hearings themselves, the organizers displayed a lack of empathy for
the residents of Ottawa, even with the benefit of hindsight.**

Conversely, the Canadian government and institutions are openly supporting genocide by Israel that’s the difference. We’re protesting our complicity in these war crimes, not just their occurrence.

Now in terms of the word genocide it’s not defined by the number of deaths, but rather the intent. It is quite tragic that so many have died in wars in the Middle East, definitely a war crime by western govts and local dictators, however neither parties in those wars were intent on wiping out all Syrians or all Iraqis, these were wars of conquest and power and resources. Not justifying them just explaining the difference. 

Israeli government have specifically and openly stated their intent on wiping out gazans. “Human animals” “nuke them” “no one is a civilian” and using the story of the “Amalek” which instructs Israelites to kill all men women and children. There have been Israeli govt documents produced which specifically plan the ethnic cleansing and displacement of gazans. This provides the basis for genocide claims. Israel wants all of Gaza for itself and with international support is killing and displacing Palestinians to get it.",comment,5

You're allowed to protest in a park because even though federally owned, it is maintained through your tax dollars and the government does respect your right to the freedom of speech. Even then, parks have rules, parks open and close. Same with roads, highways, streets, everything has rules. But the land UofT claims is not federally owned, it is owned by the university - an institution, which means it is private property. So you can protest in a park or the sidewalk in front of the university.

Also, UofT is not restricting protesting. It is restricting encampments, which is technically loitering and is considered a crime.

>Imo if it's a public entity and it's open air like a park or an outdoor swimming pool or outside university buildings or the public library parking lot it's fine to protest

Then by using your logic, why should your front yard be considered private property? Would you be okay with people protesting in your lawn? The point is that the university owns that land, is responsible for that land, has rights over that land, and that land is designated for the university and they can do whatever they want with it.

>since it would disrupt directly other members of the public from using said public facilities.

And how is an encampment in front of the university not a disruption directly affecting other members of the public?

My kids have heard hate speech directed at Jews on campus. These terrible things are directed at Canadians kids who happen to be Jewish, who are in fear of going to class or identifying as being Jewish. I don’t care how you try and justify it. No one should have to feel threatened in a place of education or anywhere else. Funny how you defend protestors wearing masks who may ‘feel threatened’ that they may face consequences for their actions yet you don’t feel the need to defend Jewish kids who ‘feel threatened’ because of the race they were born into. You obviously don’t care because there have been many of these young people who have come forward with their fears. To say these protests are just against the universities across the country and have not been directed at any Jewish students is ridiculous and false. We know that some of these people on the campuses are not even students. The police arrested a woman in Vancouver and charged her with hate speech. Anti-war protests don’t get to trump the law whether on a campus or anywhere else.
It’s mind boggling the mental gymnastics some of you will do to justify these actions. 
I have deployed to the ME on a couple of occasions. Most students don’t have any idea of the complex hatred by all sides. I have worked in field hospitals. I would love nothing more than peace to replace war because I have seen it up close and personal. But I will not support anyone in this country who steps all over the Charter Rights of another Canadian or who breaks the law. 
Im also very suspect of the actual validity of the argument for these protests. You all speak about genocide and the need to hold Israel responsible while you have been silent on cases of genocide that far eclipse that which affects Palestinians. Anyone that tries to say that there is no an anti-Semitic under current on campuses is either in denial or woefully ignorant. The sad fact is, it is fashionable to take this cause up while ignoring genocide that is on a far grander scale in places like Syria where 100’s of thousands have lost their lives, many times more than in Gaza.

The displacement of Gazans into Sinai was an actual proposed ""solution."" They can claim it's just ""hypothetical."" But it's a much more telling admission of what Israel wishes it could do and why people think ""genocide"" is an appropriate term.

Remember, people committing genocide don't traditionally broadcast it and it's always a retrospective determination. We are now trying to identify and potentially prevent an ongoing genocide, every piece of evidence like this should be taken with utmost seriousness.

Regardless, why not err on the safe side? Would we rather be like ""oh we stopped the fighting, there's no genocide let's resume"" or ""Oh damn, we killed 100,000 people, this is a genocide if only we had stopped it""

I would refer you to the Francesca Albanese human rights council report, ""Anatomy of Genocide"" which outlines how genocides emerge and creep piece by piece.

Honestly I think this argument is not in good faith. If these statements by these politicians, who control the strongest military in the Middle East, are insignificant. Then I don't see how speech in any protest or campus is threatening. These are students with comparatively 0 power to these politicians.

I think when the Israel government says what they will do, then shows you they can do it with no impunity, we should believe them. When the Israel Govt says they will collectively punish Palestinians and makes genocidal statements,  they correspindingly they kill 30,000-40,000 Palestinians and starve the rest.

somehow you have managed to take an anti war protest organized by university students and turn it into an ""anti Semitic"" and ""terrorist rhetoric"". I will restate that I never advocated for the spread of hate and those who are spreading hate against their jewish peers should be held accountable. I admire your defence of the charter, I just wish you would do it unconditionally and not only when it benefits your side of the argument.  
additionally, if Israel is not behind the genocide, the man made famine, the displacement of millions, and the destruction of infrastructure, would you care to enlighten me as to what is? 
I'm glad you mentioned Syria tho. you are absolutely right, countries like syria, Yemen and Lebanon have seen years of death and destruction, caused directly, to varying extend by the Israeli and US imperialism. and as a result of which millions of people have taken to the streets in order to protest against this.",comment,7

Only Netanyahu, Gantz, and Gallant, alongside a couple other dissenters from across the aisle, currently make all decisions until the war concludes. Which will likely trigger an immediate election based on Netanyahu's failures on 10/7. 

The difference here is that Russia and Iran via Hamas, Hezbollah, and other proxies have made this a geopolitical conflict that useful idiots across North America have completely fallen for. The result of the conflict on the ground no longer matters - which was the ultimate goal of the agitators, as they knew very well they could never win. This explains their complete disregard for Palestinian lives, who we all know are actively used as human shields.

Instead, they've worked very effectively via TikTok, news, and other social media to sow disorder. Groups like (in Canada) Samidoun, the PFLP, and IRGC - recognized terror organizations - openly fund student  groups involved with encampments. After all, if they win the PR war, that's a win against Israel, which fuels their very existence.

You seem to think that people can do what they want and not have to face consequences. Typical thinking from an entitled generation. Newsflash - if you want to pretend to be adults, be ready to be accountable. You just don’t get that whether there are a few Jews in these rallies, it is still threatening to some. You can bury your head in the sand and pretend that there are no anti-Semitic statements being made. You seem to forget that there is NO PLACE in this country for discrimination based on race or religion, whether you feel it’s justified or not. 
If these people are so proud of what they are doing, take the masks off. If they are so proud of what they are doing and don’t want to go to an institution that has any ties to Israel, leave. Show your ‘true’ conviction. 
Places of education should be free of every sort of action like this if it involves targeting a race of people, a religion, a gender, a choice of sexuality, etc.
It doesn’t matter what your beliefs are. We have people who have conviction that LGBTQ+ and their supports are targeting children and they protest. Just because they have such conviction doesn’t mean they should be allowed to protest at places where an education is provided. I bet if that were the case, you would be just fine with police coming in. Oh, and before you accuse me of being anti-LGBTQ because I used that as an example, my son is gay and we support him 100%.
You can say this is just about Zionism and it’s wrongfulness but that doesn’t hold water when terrorist slogans are used, their flags appear at these rallies, and thus the terrorist’s belief that Israel must be destroyed completely is supported. I don’t care what form of mental gymnastics that you do, but using those slogans, waving those flags, having people within that group who are anti-Semitic completely blows your argument out of the water that it’s just against ‘Zionism’. For decades, everyone knows that the beliefs of the teaching faculty, CUPE unions that work for the universities and the student unions have been infected with antisemitism like a case of drug resistant syphilis! A now students are indoctrinated with this racist nonsense. Stop romanticizing that someday grandkids will ask about their involvement in the protests unless those virtue signalling ones are also going to tell their grandkids that they hid their identities and wouldn’t truly stand up for those same beliefs if it meant giving up their education and possibly a well paying career due to being involved in such protests. 
It’s funny that I never see one sign reading ‘free the hostages’ at these rallies. I never see the protestors telling Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran etc to stop firing rockets into Israel. I never see the students with signs telling Hamas not to take the fuel and food to power their war machine. I don’t see signs asking the Arab countries to grant these people refugee status until this can be resolved. I don’t see signs denouncing Hamas for the horrific things they did or for them to lay down their weapons so the war can end, saving lives immediately. I could go on. So take those points, add to it using terrorist slogans that call for Israel to be destroyed, and try to tell me I should believe that this protest has no anti-Jewish message.
Again, you want to protest, go to the Israeli embassy. You want to protest against the Canadian government over this, go to Ottawa. You want to protest the university, do it off campus so it allows CANADIAN Jews to rightfully get their education without any type of intimidation, harassment or abuse. 
Otherwise, you are just a virtue signalling, racist supporting individual.
I am 100% anti-war. I don’t support either side. I sure as hell don’t support these bull$hit protests. I have deployed twice to ME and worked in field hospitals. I’ve seen this type of hell up close and personal. We don’t need to bring anymore hate and division into this country than we have already.",comment,-1

The protestors precisely want the university to dissolve investment in Israel so they can be transparent. Not sure why you'd be against that in that case.

  
Israel doesn't mind a small Israeli Arab minority. In terms of genocide, they are displacing  and expelling Gazans and occupied Palestinians in the West Bank. If you're looking for policy, look there, where there is an active policy of displacing Palestinians and demolishing there homes for settlers.

Example: [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-ramps-up-demolition-of-palestinian-homes-in-jerusalem](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/israel-ramps-up-demolition-of-palestinian-homes-in-jerusalem)

Do you think that when a government commits genocide or ethnic cleansing, they pass a bill called ""The Ethnic Cleansing and Genocide Act"" or do you think they are subtle about it? For example, a law that allows the Israeli government to seize the homes of Palestinian 

  
Lastly, if you're unbothered by the words of Israeli officials and document because they aren't ""policy"" then why are you so bothered by the chants of the protestors? Non of this protestors have power and their words aren't policy, so we shouldn't care what they say.",comment,5

I don’t claim to trust the IRGC or their proxies. But I almost certainly don’t trust the IDF and the Israeli government. I am not a bootlicker, you clearly are a bootlicker for one side and one side only.

Money flows on both sides. I don’t know why you’re ignoring the amount of funding coming from the Israeli side. The millions of funding from AIPAC and Israel to academic institutions. The billions the US sends to pacify other middle eastern countries. Millions spent to train US police by the IDF and the millions spent on Hasbara training and social media brigades.

In fact the money Israel spends tends to target the highest echelons of power in our government, and you’re concerned about potential money going to powerless citizens and individuals. I would counter by saying there has always been popular support for Palestine, this is not a new phenomenon. The easiest test of whether this is foreign agent destabilization or genuine anti-genocide protests: end the genocide and see what happens.

I have daughters in university. One of their friends had someone spit in her face because she was Jewish while on campus. 
And no, I am not Jewish. I am however, someone who believes in the Charter of Rights that protects people from discrimination and hate. I am someone who believes no one should be subject to discrimination or feel threatened while getting an education in this country. I am someone who is tired of the hypocritical stance that students are taking by calling out only one side in the horrendous situation. I’ll ask again, where are the signs telling Hamas to release hostages? Where are the signs demanding that Hamas be tried for the barbarous actions that set this off? Where are the signs demanding Hamas to cease taking fuel to power their rockets while hospital generators run out? Where are the signs telling Hamas to share their stores of food that they have stockpiled for an event just like this? Where are the signs telling Hamas to stop using innocent civilians as human shields? They are non-existent at your rallies so spare me the argument you care about the people there.
Watch the video from the United Nations where the son of the leader of Hamas, who was also a Hamas soldier, denounces his father’s organization along with the Palestinian Authority for their abuses of civilians. 
When you start holding everyone accountable, I will believe you care about the people caught up in this. Until then, you are simply promoting leftwing propaganda found on campuses. It’s the same nonsense with the communist movements on campuses across this country. They condemn the imperialism of the west while ignoring the horrific crimes carried out by communist countries. 
I have done two tours of duty in the ME. I worked in field hospitals. I’ve been up to my elbows in blood. I am 100% anti-war. I DO NOT SUPPORT what is going on over there. I DO NOT SUPPORT indiscriminate bombing of civilians by either side. I DO NOT SUPPORT terrorists either (by ignoring their role in this whole mess). 
So again, I’ll ask you to show me the signs from this protest that call out BOTH sides. I want to see the signs calling out Hamas and the Palestinian Authority too. The ones calling for Iran and Hezbollah to immediately stop adding to the problem. Show me these to prove this movement is valid and truly cares about the people.",comment,1

Or run into the walls of your echo chambers and cognitive dissonance? 

You will lob ad hominems, I will leave you with a message. You constantly used this “policy” argument to overlook everything I said. Then turned around and get angry at conspiracies while ignoring your policy and evidence requirement. This is pure double standard and intellectual dishonesty.

You can either genuinely reevaluate your views and we can discuss in good faith
or,
stick to them and learn better ways to gaslight people into them. 

For the latter, I suggest applying for one of many hasbara fellowship in Israel, you can improve your talking points, actually get paid to bootlick and shill for Israel and if you include it on your resume, show all future employers how much you love genocide :)",comment,2

If she was being spit on for being Jewish alone then there's a major problem with that. If she was being spit on for supporting genocide and being a zionist, she deserved it. As a Jewish person it is my duty to call bullshit on the whole zionist ideology and its foot soldiers. Again, being Jewish isn't the same as being a zionist. If you think Palestinians have ever instigated their treatment by the Israeli government, those within the population loyal to it, and the countries supporting the occupation and genocide - you haven't familiarized yourself enough with their history. If we cared as much about their dead and endangered as we did Israeli hostages, we wouldn't even be in this position. Zionists had their chance to settle elsewhere, but they took the land by force, destroying it in the process because they are run by a bunch of entitled bullies with no regard for life, even the lives of their own citizens. If we need to be angry, that would be a good place to start.",comment,2

Demands that anyone is required to follow? I have nothing to prove to you, a stranger online, investing yourself in a 2AM debate to presumably stroke your sensitive ego. More than likely because you have nothing worth waking up for. Fair play, I guess.

I purposely ignored you repeating the ""policy"" point I made because you discredited my experience with your idiotic comment. Constantly used ""policy"" argument? I said it once. You ran with it and even used it in the completely incorrect context because you have nothing else to stand on. 

Your point about the chants was the worst argued one I'd encountered on Reddit since protests began. I expect you are very likely supportive of the messaging behind the chants. Given that's likely the case, I'd suggest a long walk off a short bridge.

As far as the above post goes, you are living a double standard by participating in anything to do with this conflict as you don't even know who you're acting for.

Sounds like you support physically assaulting another person. Tells everything about you. So I’ll tell you something - I call bullshit on your claims. You say you are Jewish and yet you obviously don’t know the history you spout off about. Palestinians have been against Jews in the ME before it was even a state. Palestinians met with Hitler in 1941 to seek his approval to eradicate the Jews in the region just as he was doing in Europe. It’s right there in German records and history books. That has ALWAYS been their goal and ALWAYS will. So spare me your nonsense. Spare me that the Palestinians have always been a peaceful group of people free of committing atrocities. That’s where your narrative shows your remarks to be utter bullshit. History is full of recorded incidents of their aggression and crimes in the ME. They attacked Lebanon and tried to eradicate Lebanese Christians in past. They cut off their fuel, water, medicine, food and attempted genocide. It was Israel who intervened and saved the Christians. Palestinians instigated problems throughout the ME. Hmm, wonder why all the Muslim nations won’t accept them as refugees??? 
Again, you are too chickenshit to call out Hamas so that clearly tells me where your ideals are. You are too chickenshit to call out the Palestinian Authority. You’re too chickenshit to admit that thousands and thousands of so called ‘innocent’ Palestinians stood out on the roadways and joined in celebrations while terrorists paraded women through the streets that they raped. So spare me your virtue signalling. You are a disgusting radical. You piss on the Charter of Rights in THIS COUNTRY that protect CANADIANS from your shit.",comment,1

That’s what’s funny - your whole movement is a house of cards. No substance. No backbone. You are a bunch of spoiled, entitled little crybabies.

If sanctions are proof of something sinister, then I have some news for you about the sanctions the US and Israel impose.

You know, whenever Iranian civilians protest against the Iranian regime, they are always called foreign agents and Mossad by the state. Whenever western civilians protest the Israeli regime, they are called infiltrators by the state and their bootlickers (like you).

You’re no better than the Iranian regime, dismissing genuine protests as foreign funded instead of admitting they have a genuine cause.",comment,2

If you don't support the attacks by the Israeli government, you really needn't say much else. The university is investing the students money into those murders. The students who don't want to support a genocide while receiving an education are doing something about it. But you're not actually impartial. If the Jewish students who support the Israeli government and Zionism don't feel comfortable, then why can't the Palestinians students? If a group of zionists gather, folks like you wouldn't bat an eye, but if there's a counter protest, hoh boy now we have a problem. Seems a little biased.
