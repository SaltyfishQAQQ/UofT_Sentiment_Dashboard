But I’ve been majorly regretting my choice for the past 3 months because I hate Waterloo as a city and a campus, and really like Toronto, and I never planned to even get into UW. I was set on going to UofT, and I’m just dreading the next 5 years atp. Plus everyone is just so competitive and dreadful to be around. Would transfer rn if I could. 

I think I just need some reassurance that I didn’t make the wrong choice because I’m losing my mind ",submission,48

I worked with guidance to transfer to UofT SG, and I'm so much happier here. The campus and city is so wonderful here. 

I dont know your specific situation, but if you're not able to transfer because you would have to retake courses/a year, none of that matters in the slightest. If you're beating yourself up this badly about your decision, it may be worth looking into the possibility of transferring. 

End of the day, both schools are highly respected, and you will have a bachelor degree. Are you able to continue in your ""better program"" or will you possibly face burnout and depression with your surroundings?",comment,13

You work short-term co-ops in UWaterloo and get different employers every year. In U of T you have to work 12-16 months with no possibility of changing employer if you do co-op, and the university charges high co-op fee; if you find the job or employer not right for you, there isn't much option.",comment,4

Waterloo, even with it's housing crisis, is way more affordable than Toronto. I actually know of a few people in tech who moved from Toronto to Waterloo because they enjoy it more.

My hot take is that it is silly to make a decision on university based on how ""fun"" the city is. Especially in CS/SE, if you play your cards right and do well on co-op, you will have literally have the choice of any city in the world to move to AFTER grad. Which is FAR more important than the <5% of your life that you will spend in university. UofT CS grads also have that opportunity, obviously, but UW's co-op program is much stronger, and has much stronger pipelines to go work in the US, Vancouver or even UK/Australia (in tech).

On top of that, because UW's co-op program alternates more frequently (vs PEY), you can do mini-vacations around the world if/when you start getting offers from big companies. Not impossible at UofT, just more possible at UW. And I can assure you that living in Toronto when you're making big-tech money is way more enjoyable than living in Toronto as a broke student on a study term.

Don't be silly. The time to make decisions based on ""what city do I enjoy more"" is not right now - you're literally in high school. Do what is best for your career.",comment,1
