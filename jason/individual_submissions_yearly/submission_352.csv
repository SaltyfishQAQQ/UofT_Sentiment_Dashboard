Sharing My Experience: Navigating the Ups and Downs After an Admission Withdrawal,AnalystMoney3509,1etjiqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1etjiqe/sharing_my_experience_navigating_the_ups_and/,1723796934.0,"1. My offer of admission to UTSG was withdrawn on August 3, exactly one month before classes were set to begin, due to my English grade being below 70%. When I heard the news, I was devastated. I panicked, cried, and had to break the news to my parents. It felt like my world was crumbling; I hadn’t accepted any other offers, and I felt like I had no future. The situation was heartbreaking, and I knew I had brought this upon myself.
2. My mom immediately suggested sending me to Taiwan to take a Mandarin course, so I wouldn’t have to stay home feeling useless and facing potential ridicule (an ""Asian thing""). My mom is amazing.
3. Soon after, I decided to accept my offer of admission to UTSC. I was surprised that I could still accept it. This decision was guided by a friend from Hong Kong who knew someone in a similar situation. Shoutout to C. for the guidance.
4. I prepared documents to appeal to UTSG and used the same materials to support my consideration at UTSC. These documents were made possible by the support of my wonderful high school staff. Attending a private boarding school gave me a warm and sincere family who continued to support me even after graduation. A special shoutout to my Reddit friend, AdvertisingRemote365, who was my sounding board and supported me through the process, even reading my lengthy 1,000-word essay! (actually more he read everything lol) Meeting on Reddit might seem odd, but he’s genuinely a kind person, and I’m grateful to him and the Reddit community.
5. I was worried about housing if I got into UTSC since my admission was withdrawn so late. On August 7, I emailed St. Michael’s College to inquire about staying there despite moving from UTSG to UTSC. I received a warm reply saying it was possible as long as I remained a UofT student. Thank you to Ms. Eastman and her lovely team for their kindness.
6. I didn’t just sit back and wait; I actively explored other options. With my mom's help, I discovered that I could still apply to Australian universities, as their academic year differs. On August 11, I applied to the University of Sydney (Usyd), University of Melbourne (Umelb), and UNSW.
7. On August 12, I received the news that UTSC had approved my admission. I had met all conditions, and I was deeply grateful to finally have a place to study.
8. Today, I heard back from UTSG that my appeal was not reinstated. On the positive part, I also heard back from Usyd—they accepted me with a 20% international student scholarship. I couldn’t be more grateful. 

**NEVER BACK DOWN, NEVER WHAT???**

Now, I’m fully committed to taking a language course in Taiwan before attending university in Australia this Feb/March. I’m also actively waiting for the admission decisions from the other two Australian universities. Just like I was committed to UofT, I know that the future is full of possibilities and uncertainties.

**Life Lessons:**

1. I’ve learned not to be overconfident and to always do my best, even when I think everything is secured—nothing is final until it’s final.
2. Even when it feels like the world is falling apart, there’s always a new beginning and a new path if I keep TRYING. Efforts never betray and laziness def gave me immediate result. 
3. I couldn’t have made it through this without the support of others. I’m so thankful for everyone who played a positive role in my life during this time.
4. It’s important not to expect the best possible outcome, even when things seem to be going well. Always be prepared for the worst and keep your options open.
5. I just want to say I got an amazing mom. Mom is a powerful being. 

**UofT Lesson:**

Now, for the less positive part. After everything I’ve been through, I’ve realized how slow and inefficient UofT’s system is:

1. My admission was canceled exactly a month before classes were set to start, even though they received our final transcripts back in July.
2. After accepting my offer from UTSC, I tried calling their admissions office to expedite my decision, but their phone service was down. Emails went unanswered until August 15 (yesterday)
3. The payment deadline was August 13 for UTSC, but I hadn’t even received my final admission decision from UTSC before then. I received the offer on August13 (Thailand time) When I called the registrar on August 9, they told me to pay anyway. Where is the communication? If I hadn’t received my offer, I would have lost money unnecessarily due to currency exchange rates.
4. Due to these circumstances
   * Courses were full
   * There were no time to take any further action, potentially forcing a deferral (which I am not doing)

I understand that I didn’t meet the conditions, but the process could have been much more efficient. Canceling my admission after I’d completed course selection felt like tearing apart my efforts and dignity. At the very least, they should cancel and consider appeals before the course selection date.

When I applied to Australian universities, their systems were far more effective. It took them less than one day—literally less than one day—to notify me about a missing document and to request it for continued review. I immediately requested my transcript from the BC transcript service (BC still hasn't sent it after a few days lol). While Australia is this fast to hand me admission decision and review my application, UofT took over a month to inform me that I didn’t meet their condition. How difficult is that?

I have learnt so many things within just a period of two weeks. 

Thank you for taking the time to read my vent/rant—whatever you want to call it.   
If people are interested I can keep posting on updates in the comment. 

At last I just want to share my positivity and appreciation to everyone out here who experience good and bad things. ",submission,74

The reality is, my school is much tougher than most in BC, with longer, more intensive classes from 8:15 AM to 3:30 PM. We also have mandatory G-blocks after school for a few hours, Saturday classes from 9:25 AM to 12:15 PM, and required volunteer work. Missing a single class results in two hours of after-school detention (we have five classes a day), and absences are only approved by the nurse (there’s no travel leave, only REAL sick leave), which is extremely difficult. The rules are strict, and many students get expelled every year. Additionally, if you don’t have an A, you’re required to attend a mandatory one-hour session from 8 to 9 PM in a classroom. Not to mention the tons of homework and schoolwork we get daily—I spend at least 2-3 hours studying every day, plus a whole Saturday. My English grades suffered because I was sick and hospitalized, which meant missing classes, missing discussions, and having fewer ideas to write in essays and wrong analyses. We barely have any free time, with only 7 hours of leave per day, along with curfews and restrictions (I could write a whole essay on school rule, these are just the basics). Weekday outings are out of the question—our only free time is Friday evening, Saturday after class, and Sunday. My only day to sleep and chill is Sunday and those sick days for recovery. A friend who transferred to a public high school even mentioned how much easier it is after the move (fewer restrictions+easier grading system) Don’t belittle a “boarding school” system and use your limited perspective to judge everyone else.
