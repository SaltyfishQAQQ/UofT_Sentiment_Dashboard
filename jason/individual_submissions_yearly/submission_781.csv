Also the speed of learning a language depends on the language.",comment,54

i took turkish btw, we did many advanced grammar topics, learned all tenses, etc., but didn't focus much on vocab especially in the advanced class",comment,4

If you’re also studying it outside class such as trying to read or listen /watch content in that language and practise speaking with people from that culture. My friend studied Swahili for four years because she knew she wanted to work abroad. She is 100% Canadian. She was able to become conversant by the time she graduated. It also probably depends on difficulty of language.,comment,3

However, my impression of upper year courses is that speaking is often not a priority. You might get really good at writing a critique of the socio-political environment in the country or analyzing poetry but if you got dropped in the street where people use slang and informal grammar, you might struggle. I would say if your goal is to become a fluent speaker you'll probably have to put some time into listening/speaking on your own but if anyone has stick with it for four years feel free to correct me.",comment,2
