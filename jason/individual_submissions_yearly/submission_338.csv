"(Relatively) Affordable Restaurants around UTSG that are good that are not McDonalds level fast food, a list",ASomeoneOnReddit,1hc9dre,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hc9dre/relatively_affordable_restaurants_around_utsg/,1733965738.0,"In this trying season I’d like to share something more light hearted: affordable good eats

Starter: **El Furniture Warehouse**. Several locations: *Bloor at Bathurst, Yonge-Dundas next to TMU, and Queen W. Around Spadina, etc.*

It’s a regular bar place with a decent selection of bar foods, burger with fries cost about 10 each, unironically cheaper than a Big Mac Meal (12$) and tastes better. Their Mac&Cheese is phenomenal.

**Yin Ji** on *Spadina at Nassau St bus station*

A Cantonese fav, all congees below 10$ and fills up you just right. The rice roll noodles are authentic, can’t find that anywhere nearby.

*Next door to Yin Ji* is **Sizzler Kabab**

One of the best South Asian place near UTSG, 12$ for a nicely portioned butter chicken rice and pop. If you like a more spicy dish, go for the lamb karahi, it is spicy and rich just like any other karahi you can find in Toronto (Karahi Boy for one) but right next to campus and cheaper.

That’s all for now, I might add more if I can find

edit: forgot some really important one.

**Miss Fu at Chengdu** on *Yonge between Bloor and Wellesley.*

9$ for authentic Szechuan noodle is unheard of. My new found love for Szechuan food as it is the only place where I can manage one meal under 20 or even 10$, and it’s actually good. The Szechuan Cold Noodle has the portion of one  ramen bowl and is below 10$, just beware that due to the authenticity, it is very spicy, lamb karahi level spicy.

**Pho Hung** on *Spadina between Dundas and Nassau at Kensington Market,* cross street from Yin Ji and Sizzler Kabab

Wow, Spadina just keeps it coming. Gem after gem.

Cash only! But 12$ regular house special pho dac biet topped with actual beef and tripe and tendon in nice soup makes me a returning customer. Their menu is perhaps the biggest on this list, everything from soup noodle to rice to stir fries to drinks, but I only ever get the pho.

Another pho place would be **Vietnam Lovely Noodle** on *Bloor between Bathurst and Spadina*

i place this below Pho Hung because it is slightly, just very slightly, more expensive than Hung.

BUT

They take cards. The service at Vietnam Lovely Noodle is better too, and has a more interesting menu with Malaysian fusion like laksa and curry, owner might be Malaysian or Vietnamese Chinese, all I know is the boss speaks mandarin with a southern accent. There’s also free shrimp cracker as appetizer.

it is also the first place where I realized sriracha sauces at a pho place are not supposed to go in soup, as they are the first ever pho place to give me a tiny empty sauce dish alongside the beansprouts. Lovely, deserves a mention.

Edit 2: two baozi (big steamed Chinese dumpling) places:

**Juicy Dumpling**. At *Dundas W-Spadina*. 

I think UTSG folks likely already know about this one. Cheap dumpling is all I gotta say.

**Mom’s Pan Fried Buns**. On *Dundas W - Spadina but south to Chinatown Centre*, also on *Dundas W east to St Patrick Station*. 

Pretty decent price, 4 for $7.99. All the noodles and rices are at $9.99. The flavour is authentic for sure and the noodle at least got plenty meat, worth the price.  ",submission,78
