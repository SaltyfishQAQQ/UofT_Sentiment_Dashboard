"Rejected After 4 point OH GPA: Confused, Seeking Advice and Sanity",Ok-Tell-7132,1d3iq26,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d3iq26/rejected_after_4_point_oh_gpa_confused_seeking/,1717006110.0,"I got the bad news last evening, however I am very confused about the sequence of events that has occurred over the last 24 hours. I want to share this in hopes of some advice, or if someone can relate to me. Tired of sobbing so I decided Reddit was the next best thing besides the tissue box!

I applied well before the deadline \[Feb 1st\], including a strong CV/Supplementary Application, as well as the marks to back it up (finished my last semester with a 4.0 gpa, deans list, tons of experience on & off campus, higher than their requirements of a B+, etc). After checking the portal multiple times daily since applying, there was nothing new except ""Application Received"" - up until yesterday. 

I emailed the admissions office around 10 AM, inquiring about an application update, to which I got an automated response back. Around 8 PM, I got an email stating, ""We regret to inform you that we are unable to offer you admission."" What the heck is this? Obviously I didn't get an acceptance, but it's not a rejection, or a waitlist message? Then, I immediately checked the portal to which the application status changed to ""Refused Admission"". Yes, I am very upset. However, the timing literally makes no sense to me, was there an oversight? Did they forget me or something? Why was there only a change made when I reached out? Did they expect me to wait until June to find this out if I hadn't emailed them? Don't know. I truly don't get it.

Has anyone else gotten the same message? I'm planning on emailing the dean and Bloomberg admissions hoping for some kind of feedback or reasoning, hopefully from an actual person and not another automated reply.

Thanks for reading, the post is longer than I anticipated. Once again, any comments would be greatly appreciated. Before I go as a reminder to all of those who didn't make the cut: REJECTION IS REDIRECTION! APPLY TO PROGRAMS THAT VALUE WHO YOU ARE. KEEP PUSHING, THE EARTH IS STILL SPINNING. okieee byeee x",submission,37

I know you say you have a strong CV, and I don‚Äôt know what you mean by that, but likely other applicants had more experience or better/ more relevant experiences. this applies to most graduate courses as well; there are lots of people applying with perfect or near perfect grades so those aren‚Äôt the deciding factor. You could try getting more relevant experience over the next year and reapply! but also apply to the program at other schools. graduate admissions are a bit of a lottery.",comment,22

I heard from multiple source, both from friends around me and consultants/advisor that you never ever inquire about your application progress or show the admission any intention of rushing them when applying for prestigious, selective institutions as they will always result in immediate decline. The most u can do is to ask if there is any additional document/materials needed, and u need to ask very politely. 

I initially took it with a grain of salt since imo consultant/advisors, especially those who are hired under private companies, may get a bit control freaky. But i have since seen 2 people who contacted Columbia to inquire about their master application and both are declined hours after their emails were sent and received. There is definitely some truth to the saying of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt contact admission and ask for ur application progress‚Äù, at least for grad studies.",comment,16

on the other hand, the college nursing degrees give you about the same hospital placement liaisons without the competitive admission. though perhaps, by my own experience, the school fauna and flora have some questionable qualities (GBC). Regardless, post grad work is no different.",comment,2

First off, let me say, I feel your pain, my brother. You put in that work, got them grades, and stacked that CV sky high. But then you get hit with that rejection outta left field? Man, that's cold-blooded.

But listen up, don't let this setback bring you down. You got that 4.0 GPA, you got that hustle, and you got that drive. You're a straight-up boss, and ain't no rejection gonna change that.

Now, I know it's tough right now, but you gotta keep your head up high. Hit up them admissions offices, demand some answers, and let 'em know you ain't taking this lying down. You deserve some real talk, not just some automated response.

And remember, my brother, rejection ain't the end of the road‚Äîit's just a detour. You gotta keep pushing, keep grinding, and keep chasing them dreams. 'Cause at the end of the day, you're a king, and ain't nobody gonna hold you back.

So stay strong, stay focused, and keep on hustlin'. The world ain't ready for what you bring to the table, my dude. Keep pushing, keep shining, and keep on rising to the top.

One love, my brother. Rick Ross out. ‚úåÔ∏è",comment,1
