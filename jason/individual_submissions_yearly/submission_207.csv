Prof give grade subjectively and threatened me to drop classes what should I do?,imJeffZ,1g92ayb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g92ayb/prof_give_grade_subjectively_and_threatened_me_to/,1729548513.0,"Edit 7: Condemning someone whose mom just passed away seems morally bad. I need some suggestion on how I should proceed.

Edit 6: The prof's mom passed away today (not joking), no wonder why she was so emotional. RIP sincerely. Should I forgive her? I am really feeling sorry now.

**Edit 5: Don't let our prof get away with the threatening part.**

Edit 4: Our bad ass prof is here in the comments, guess who she is?

I am enrolled in some language studies class and the prof's been a d\*\*\*. She gives marks subjectively, and when I argued she said literally ""marks are non-comparable across different individuals"". When I asked a struggling (but prof's favor) student in class what that student got, the prof yelled at me, in front of the entire class, ""You have no rights to know other people's marks. I have never done remarks, and if you ask for remark you WILL get a lower mark. If you are not happy then drop the course and also drop the successive course.""

I am in my final year and needed the BR credit from this course & its successsive course to graduate. She's also teaching the successive course in winter term. So I felt threatened and forced to apologized to her after class. She literally said again ""Marks are given on a person to person bases.""

I am feeling very upset right now. I strived to study and give me best in this class, but the prof can give out marks subjectively and there's no universal standard among my classmates. Even worse, I have to apologize to her for threatening me.

Can someone please give advise on what should I do?

Edit: I am sorry I really shouldn't be asking about other people's mark publicly, but please focus on the threatening part. ""If you ask for remark you get a lower mark"", ""Why don't you drop this class and the successive class?"". Is this acceptable?

Edit2: Would it be possible for me to ask for a third party grader from here on? I really don't want her to mark my assignments anymore as there would definitely be bias.

Edit 3: \*\* I am taking this to the end. This isnt just about the grading, but abuse of power; threatening a student for disagreement is way beyond code of professional conduct. This violates what UofT tries to foster and I never hope to see this happening to another student again. \*\*

Edit 6: Yesterday I made an comment out of grief and indignation, I was mad at how raccoon\_attach avoided talking about threatening student and gaslighted that I was the cause of the problem. I asked raccoon\_attack to apologize to me and never do this again to other students.

BTW **imagine you are a PhD student and your advisor crosses that line and threatened you on your degree. What would you think?**

>I like how you are just a teaching stream prof and acted like a bad ass as if you can threaten students. This is the key part that will get you kicked. If you apologize to me by email tonight by 12 and promise me not to do this again I will let this go, but if no I am taking this to everyone in arts and science and the dean, and yes I will skip your EAS department.",submission,137

If she/him/they don't do anything, you can escalate it to your program's coordinator manager. (If you haven't noticed, most classrooms have cameras in the back of the room so there might be recored evidence that she/him/they yelled at you).

I was also a UofT student and, from experience, if you decide that your prof do a remark, you will potentially get a lower mark from what you got already (it is very rear you don't know this - usually professors in first year tell everyone this). So think about it, if you decide to go on that path.

Or worst case, just sit through the course for the sake of passing. Because you cannot ask for a regrade, the professor can lower your mark.

However, I would be careful with any complaints. Please note, the complaint should be based on the professors behavior towards you: not due to the marking. “Subjective” marking is not against any rules, you simply cannot mark without some degree of subjectiveness.  Not even in my math courses, or courses that people believe to be objective. There’s always some degree of subjectivity. There’s no way you could win that argument.",comment,13

Yelling has no place in the classroom. I would try to follow up in writing stating what you heard and ask her to confirm so she can address your concerns.

Students talk about their grades all the time so I have no idea what she is talking about.  There should be some sort of grading rubric. They are not required to disclose it but it ensures that bias is removed as much as possible.

If she reiterates that rereads will result in a lower grade consider escalating.  I would approach the arts and science registrars office saying that you feel uncomfortable reaching out to the instructor or dept.  They will contact the department to find out what is going on.

Students are allowed to request a reread but must provide proof of where additional grades should be alloted.  Check the calendar (reassessments of term work).  Instructors can and do make mistakes but the request should not elicit a hostile response.  The grade can go up or down or stay the same based on the quality of the work. If you’re an arts and science student email ask.artsci@utoronto.ca if you are concerned about this and possible repercussions.

A lot of assignments are actually graded quite generously, and she may be frustrated at your open show of disagreement.  Most profs will say that 'if you ask for a regrade, the mark could be higher OR lower'.  If an assignment was marked really generously to begin with, a prof might point out to a student who complains will likely end up with a lower mark from the regrade.  

I think the whole situation escalated because you were openly asking students for their mark.  This really upset her and probably create a tense situation in the class.  Of course students talk about their marks. You could have waited and chatted with people after class.  But by openly asking in classtime, it was putting people on the spot.  As she said, 'no one has to tell you their mark' - you were openly asking for confidential information, so she had to address that and put a stop to it.  

There are a number of comments here that assume that her raising her voice at you warrants some sort of serious response from the university.  I've seen profs yell at students who were caught cheating, who were on their phones in class, who were being disrespectful.  This falls into the third category.  It's not ideal, but not something anyone is going to care about realistically.",comment,9

Nothing came of it unfortunately but a slap on the wrist.

Her last name is the same as a very famous children's book writer but no relation. 

She's sexist and marks men with extreme impunity. I wonder if she still forces people to meditate 20 minutes at start of lecture wasting everyone's time. 

You could see  the people with attention deficit disorders squirm, or people just uncomfortable meditating in general. 

If this sounds familiar to you and you identify as *male* and question your grades, consider getting a regrade done by the department head.


Edit: theres nothing that explicity prevents you from asking another student what they received as a grade, it's akin to employers saying don't ask another's salary.

anecdotally, i’ve never had a professor at UofT yell at me. the only time i’ve been yelled at is in my master’s program because this older professor was stressed due to undergrad exams and misunderstood a question. she amended her mistake by giving a public apology for her unprofessionalism and misunderstanding the next class.

Grading is often subjective in general, so of course the same thing applies to everyone.  As some other comments have noted, the prof has the expertise in the field and assesses each students' work based on whatever criteria is relevant....but many assignments (especially things like essays) always have a subjective element.

More often, an assignment will be taken from a TA's hands, and a person who's actually finished their doctorate (ie., the instructor) will go over it with a high degree of attention. They often catch things that we do not; sometimes, they have higher writing standards (how do you gauge ""convincing evidence"" objectively in an essay-based class?). I don't know if it would be fair to omit this information from a pupil. The surety of their statement is weird, but it aligns with my experience.

I do know that in our dept, explaining that the assignment will be escalated has discouraged some students from being aggressive with our TAs, which sadly happens every year. Idk; I wonder about a lot of dynamics that were omitted from this story.

ETA: Yeah, OP threatens the person he thinks is the ""Prof"" elsewhere in the thread. I'm paraphrasing (but took a screenshot to show colleagues cause wow) but it read something like ""I like how you're just a teaching stream prof...

If they went to the prof and asked about the grading, raising specific areas of concern, and the prof said that they wouldn't re-grade it and that they have a policy to 'never revisit a mark', I would say that the prof was overly harsh and potentially unfair.  Mind you I don't think it's problematic for a prof to have some strict rules in place around re-grading. I've known a lot of profs to have very specific protocols around such requests, such as a request made in writing that identifies the error in the grading -- I tend to go that route in larger classes.  In other words, a student cannot just make a general complaint about a low mark - ie.""my mark is too low, can you regrade it and make it higher?"".  A lot of profs would rightly say a very firm no to that.

If OP wants to launch a campaign against the prof, they are free to do so.  My word of advice to them was to reflect on their own actions and to apologize for over-stepping if the whole thing played out in the classroom.

If the prof said she never does re-marks, then.....maybe she has truly never done them before?  That doesn't strike me as all that grave.

I'm actually not familiar with any codified student rights that state that a student is owed a regrade.  I've never been given any documents on that as instructional staff at the university and I've never been advised that students are automatically allowed to ask for regrading.  (I've just tended to follow the practices of other profs on this, in terms of setting some limitations around it).  I'm familiar with the official petitions process or requests for deferrals (and those processes are quite rigid in terms of how you go about them), etc.  There's an approval process for that kind of request, which can be denied.  But that's clearly not what OP was talking about.

ETA - Okay I located the document about requests for regrading of term work.  It's never been included in the policies that I receive from my department, so I'm glad I read it over.  There's quite a few stipulations around it, and it sounds like requests should be in writing.  It says ""If a re-grading is granted by an instructor, the student must accept the resulting mark as the new mark, whether it goes up or down or remains the same. The student must accept this condition to continue with any re-grade or appeal process. Instructors and TAs should ensure all communication with the student is in writing (e.g., follow-up e-mail) and keep a copy for later reference"".  

 (It sounds to me like a policy that might not help OP much.  If they demand a 'regrade' and the prof feels they were already marked fairly, the regrade seems likely to be the exact same mark...or lower if the prof felt they were actually generous the first time around.  I'm not sure that a student could really do much about that, if I'm reading the policy correctly).",comment,1

And this comment of yours really adds an important insight. You're defending the profs because of how they often behave and if they act unprofessional, they must have a reason to do so, and the student must have driven them unprofessional? Why don't you put the same kind of justification on the students as well? (eg. if the students act unprofessional, they must have a reason, and the prof must have driven them unprofessional).

You seem to be the only smart and reasonable person of this subreddit.😂

Anyways, I myself have a PhD and would have reacted the same way if someone did this in my class. Now, 'yelling' is upon interpretation. As a human, maybe I'd give in to emotions at that point in time and naturally might sound a bit higher pitched. Doesn't mean I have a beef on a personal level with that individual. In this particular case, they were discussing grades but let's assume that they were discussing about their relationship problems in class. Not just me, it'd piss any instructor.

Instructors spend a lot of time to prepare course material, in my case, I even practice giving mock lectures several times before a mirror. After all this preparation, if this is the level of respect they have for the material then it's a matter of concern.

These are kids. It’s their first time here. There is a power imbalance, and the prof is the adult/professional here to set the tone. 

It’s also a learning environment beyond the academic sense where for the first time they’re on their own in a professional environment, and if there is need to correct a faux pas it’s best practice to have that conversation in private, and maybe later address the class with a statement ‘to please save any conversations or debriefs for after class’.

I interpreted this to mean that all of this unfolded within the classroom - and perhaps I'm wrong about that.  But OP says that 'after getting back the assignment', he/she argued about it and then started asking the mark of the weaker student (who OP also suspected of getting special treatment).
