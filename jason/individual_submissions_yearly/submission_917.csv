MAT137 students: this is your sign to do problem sets with a partner,melkorbin,1fizgg9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fizgg9/mat137_students_this_is_your_sign_to_do_problem/,1726580190.0,"Even if they don’t know all the answers you’ll still learn a ton from doing the pset with someone else!! I did my first two psets alone and bombed them, did the rest with a friend and did much better.

Also— don’t delegate. Try all the questions yourself. Then talk it over with your friend. You’ll be surprised how similar pset questions can be to test questions, so it pays to have done all the questions.",submission,16
