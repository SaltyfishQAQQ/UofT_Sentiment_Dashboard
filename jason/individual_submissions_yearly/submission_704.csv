I cant seem to focus on anything even though midterms are right around the corner,ohjeenguh,1fwjmq6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fwjmq6/i_cant_seem_to_focus_on_anything_even_though/,1728107435.0,Idk whats wrong with me. Like i genuinely cant seem to focus. The thing is i go to the library like everyday but once im there i cant seem to get any work done. Im in first year and i have midterms next week so i should be desperately studying but instead i have been struggling. I dont know why i cant focus. Ive been overwhelmed with everything and ive been just feeling really down this week to the point where i just cried in the library. I dont even know whats wrong with me though. Maybe im just anxious? Maybe its cause ive been having a hard time adjusting? Maybe cause i dont really have any friends yet and thats one big factors of my concern. I just feel alone. Im struggling to keep pushing forward to keep trying when all ive got is me. And im not helping myself feel any better. This month has just been really tough for me more than i actually realized. I think i realized i was having a hard time once i actually broke down. Everythings so hard,submission,26

Don't feel bad, university is so vastly different from high school or anything you've known up until this point. Its a matter of finding what works for you, and what doesnt, but that's easier said than done. 

Dont feel discouraged if you fail (thats coming from a LifeSci student that bombed her first chemistry and physics midterms so badly she cried on the go train home LOL), you learn from your mistakes, and university is fortunately built in such a way that you can bounce back (not without hard work, but still).

I suggest if the library doesnt help (sometimes I feel bad because I see everyone busting their ass off and I feel still lost about what to do), try studying at home. Use 'study with me' videos, they hold you accountable, give you someone to study with (ambiance is good too!!) and ensures you dont study TOO much and burn yourself out.

Be patient, and be kind with yourself <3 you got this!!",comment,1
