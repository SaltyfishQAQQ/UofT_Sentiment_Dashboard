I was going to apply earlier, but eng exams became super demanding and I couldn't figure out how to manage my time right. I'm afraid that because I didn't apply to the postings straight away the positions have already filled up, even if they were still posted on the page. It's been almost a week since the application deadline passed;  should I keep waiting to hear back or just accept my fate and move on? Speaking of, do they contact you through email or through ClnX?",submission,28

All of them contacted me through Email.,comment,7

It usually helps if you network with the employers that you want to do work-study with. **Many work-study employers outside of the research field prefer to re-hire students who have worked in the same work-study in the previous year/term.**

Examples of networking that can help you get on the same playing field include: attending events from the sector, visiting office hours with the professor, getting involved in relative extracurriculars, etc.",comment,3

It really just depends on the professor and the space that they have. For my PI, I didn’t have a position in her lab previously. What worked for me was asking the professors for feedback if they sent me some rejection email or if it has been a while since the interview and I haven’t heard anything, and I was able to find patterns in the things that professors were looking for. Another thing that got me my position was that my interests were unique and I was able to connect her work to what I want to do in the future, and that made me stand out and get an interview offer.",comment,1

You might as well look externally now. Even federal government summer interns have completed or started their training already.

Just take it as a life lesson one that hopefully you won’t repeat mistake again on.

If you have any friends and family who can make hiring decisions or have someone who can that reports to them, it’s time to call them up. If you are dating start considering asking dates you vibe with well for leads too. A girl I know dated a guy from online whose dad was a partner at a big 4 accounting firm who then got her a job right away she would never had a chance for straight out of school.",comment,8

In future application terms there is likely no harm in emailing professors before and during the application period if you are really interested in their work. As well take a look at the research catalogue on clnx to scope out professors that interest you for next term to reach out to.,comment,2

also, does it show if i've been rejected on clnx or do they just ghost you and you figure it out yourself?",comment,1
