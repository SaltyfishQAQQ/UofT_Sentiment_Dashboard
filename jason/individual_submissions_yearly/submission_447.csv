I have experience with this. I attended and quit UofT in 2008 and always regretted not completing my degree. To the point where even being on campus gave me a terrible feeling of regret and failure in the pit of my stomache.

I'm happy to report that I came back in 2020 and studied part time for several years and just returned to full time this year. I absolutely love being a student again, it's so much better and more rewarding as an adult, and it was the best decision I've made in years.

As long as you finished one course (all I had finished!), you don't need to reapply and be accepted. You literally just contact your college to re-register you and can immediately register for new courses. You could likely be in courses as early as the next summer subsession if you wanted to. Not only that, but all your credits you received are still valid towards your degree which will have the same rules (breadth requirements, etc) as when you started your degree.

If you want to and are ready to come back, it's very very easy to do!",comment,64

Contact admissions and see how the process works for you. Doesn't hurt to reach out and see what is required/offered.

All in all though, if you have a job and leaving it to study doesn't seem viable for you, then don't. It's a big commitment, and it seems you need to do some personal reflection.",comment,30

I completely made peace with the fact that I’m not built for school and I won’t get a degree. In those 3 years, I worked and tried new things learned more about myself and before I knew it those 3 years passed by and I was flirting with the idea of trying school again but I wasn’t sure if I could do it. 

I enrolled in 3 courses and then worked on completing my degree - and I’m now going to start my PhD in the fall. All this is to say that sometimes you just need a break to find the motivation to push through school. Once you feel ready transition back and you’ll be fine :)",comment,25

I feel like my life is fuller now.


I know it's never as simple as people say it is, I wish it were easy to say just follow your heart, but if you already know it's eating you up inside, draft a plan and see what's possible. Some paths are not as clear until later, I couldn't decide on my majors until 2 months after I decided to come back, but you might not notice what's available to you until you give it a shot :)",comment,2

I did two full years and then  took a year off saying I would go back. Life happened and I never did. I did manage to start a great career that I love and provides for my family, but I always regretted not finishing my degree. 
In 2021, when classes were online,  I decided to finish. So I completed two years of credits while working and being a parent to 3. I was 40 when I graduated. 
I loved it soooo much. It didn't matter that most of the students were the age of my kids, and that I was older than some professors. I had so much fun and school felt so different from when I was slogging through it as a burnt out 20 year old.
As you said, you won't have to reapply, and you should be able to do part-time if you want. I honestly support anyone who wants to go back. Even if it is just to say you finished. I have never been so proud of myself.",comment,2
