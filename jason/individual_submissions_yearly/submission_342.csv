PLEASE KEEP IN MIND, we are all different in the ways we study, one method may be incredibly useful for one person, while completely useless for another person.

For example, I vehemently hate notion for many reasons, but I know people who love it and can succeed using it

I am currently averaging a 4.0 this semester, and ill probably end with a 4.0.

While I am not personally in STEM, these tools might be even better for STEM than the Criminology courses I am in.

# Preface

Hi everyone, I've been seeing an influx of depressing posts both on this Reddit and Instagram.

Being a first year student is incredibly stressful. When I first got into UofT, I did not know how to properly study, nor did I understand how to excel in university. Consequently, my first year GPA was abysmal (3.4)

Failing a midterm, doing poorly on a midterm, or just getting a bad grade is one of the worst feelings in the world. This is made worse with the perception that your peers are doing better then you, especially if you've been studying while other people have just been partying.

The sad truth is, it is not about the amount of time you study, but HOW you study. I don't like saying this because its cringe, **study smarter not harder**.

**Example**:

* I took a Astronomy course a while back, I didn't formally study at all, course average was \~60 and I got a 91% on the midterm. Not perfect, but the only ""studying"" I did was glance over my notes the night before (1 hour).

**But, there is hope!**

There **is** and **is not** a magic solution to studying.

My formula for studying

Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time

Higher success = better performance.

(Nothing too complex, probably doesn't work in many cases, just a showcase of my logic)

**There is not a magic solution because:**

* You cannot study for an hour a day and succeed in every course. That is simply impossible.
* Flashcards wont save you if you have not looked at a course until the day before a midterm
* Formula for you nerds
   * Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time
   * Success = Studying x 100 x 1
      * You may enjoy something a lot but if you do not study at all (time), you will not succeed.

**There is a magic solution because**

* Think about it this way, studying is a constant, you must always study.
* SO, to influence studying, we must instead manipulate our feelings towards it, THIS IS THE MAGIC SOLUTION.
* Think about it.
   * If you enjoy studying -> you will retain information more and study better -> you will succeed.
* **Example:** You probably all like watching Netflix, I bet if I was to ask you the plot of an episode of a show you really liked, you would be able to recount it to me almost perfectly.
   * Why? You enjoyed the episode so you can remember it even though you only watched it once.
* Formula again
   * Success = Studying x Enjoyment x Time
   * Success = Studying x 100 x 10
      * With time and enjoyment, you will have a higher chance of success.

Thus, this guide has 2 goals

* Teach you how to study (possibly using tools)
* Make it fun

**Quick terminology**

Tutorial hell

* ""**a state of perpetual learning, often marked by the consumption of one tutorial after another without putting acquired knowledge into practice**""
* **TLDR**, you keep on switching applications, or attempting to perfect the application you use without actually studying
* Examples:
   * Using OneNote, not actually studying the notes but spending hours organizing them
   * Using flashcards, spending hours making and refining your flashcards without actually studying them.

# MY METHODOLOGY

When looking for a ""study tool"", I personally believe the **best applications** are those which:

* Give the user the ability to retrieve any information they want from any previous week.
* Automate much of the work the user needs to do.

Going to my example regarding Astronomy, the reason why I did not need to study that much is due to how all my notes were already prepared.

If I was confused about something, I could find it in my notes and read it over quickly. I also found it fun to make my notes, cathartic to see everything organized.

Through automation and streamlining the studying process, we seek to avoid **tutorial hell.**

 

**Example**:

I once saw a person in my study group spend 5 hours creating flashcards.

Their process was:

Get their notes -> find what is important -> put it into flashcards.

While they were doing this, I was taking those 5 hours to understand the most complex concepts.

I remember I got 89% on the midterm, and while I did not ask what mark they got, they told me that they planned on CR/NCR the class (probably not that good).

 

# Apps to use

***OneNote***

It works. If you are using it and its good, stick with it.

However, I found that it did not automate things enough for me. I found myself rewriting my notes the week before the midterm. Moreover, I found myself re-watching lectures, we want to prevent this as much as we can.

So it works, but its not the best.

***Conclusion***:

I did not have fun using OneNote, and I also found it hard for idea retrieval.



***Notion***

I hate this app, tutorial hell in full display. If you use it and it works, great, continue using it.

But this is the app which I see people in my study group spend hours on just customizing it. I have seen countless first years use this app, thinking it is some magic solution

How do i know? Because i thought it was a solution when i was in first year. I spent hours customizing it, only to realize in the end that i learned nothing. 

Moreover, it really does not help with knowledge retrieval and even worse, the app is really unoptimized.

***Conclusion***:

When I used Notion, I found it fun at first, but then got frustrated as I could not incorporate automation in the way I hoped. Also, I found many aspects of it redundant and only there for aesthetics.



***Remnote***

Better then Notion, used it for a year, don't know how it is now, cant really say anything on it :/

***Conclusion***:

Cant say, I liked it when I used it, but I could not automate that much. Also I did not enjoy the UI.



***Obsidian***

What I currently use, easy knowledge retrieval, canvas mode might be the best thing since sliced bread.

I’m a visual learner so the fact that I can literally see the connections between ideas is insanely useful. Ever since I started using it UofT has become easy. (By ""easy"" i mean i enjoy studying now)

Not only that, but it is incredibly fun to use. I hated writing essays, now I find it fun (I’m not a masochist)

A canvas of one of my history essays.

[I find this super fun.](https://preview.redd.it/u87n6y5uvxwd1.png?width=606&format=png&auto=webp&s=2df4349d2c8684825892a40515364517a6ec8c9c)

Another extremely useful aspect of Obsidian is the linking system, where you can link notes together to make connections. This creates another visual mind map which greatly assists in studying.

* This was the main reason why I was able to go into my astronomy midterm without studying, I found that all the connections were there already, all I had to do was clarify on those which confused me.

Just like the other apps, there is one major obstacle

To make your perfect setup is time consuming.

* Your setup is called a ""vault"" there are many customizations you can do. 
   * You can make a table which pulls all files with the words ""Physics"" in it.
   * You can put certain tags on files so that if they have important terms, they appear a different color. The possibilities are endless.
   * BUT, you need to code these tables.
      * Thankfully, ChatGPT helps a lot with this, I have no idea how to code, but ChatGPT did it all for me perfectly :).
* You may get stuck in tutorial hell, hence I would recommend setting this up during reading week, when you have time to refine your studying habits.

If you are to start using obsidian, and you would like assistance, shoot me a DM.

***Conclusion***:

I find this app to be both fun and something which automates my studying process.

However, setting it up took some time.



***Flashcards*** **(Anki)**

To succeed with flashcards, you need to use them consistently, you cannot make flashcards a day before class and expect a 4.0

Also, flashcards mainly cover surface level ideas, without providing connections and information.

So, while they are useful, they are rarely used correctly by first years.

***Conclusion***:

Nothing really bad about it, not really a note taking device. Just something you can use to assist in memorization.



# How I study

With Obsidian, I have every single lecture listed in a table with the topics of the lecture beside it.

Whenever a midterm comes up, I look at the topics of each lecture and decide those which i need to study more. 

**My process is this**: 

* Look at table, if confused on lecture topic, put in list. 
* Once list is complete, go to topic which needs clarification
   * Because of how Obsidian works, all the information needed is there.
   * Study topic, if more information is needed, do research into the topic. 
      * 80% of the time, I have all the info I need, so I can go past the topic. 
* Create list of completed topics 
* (Optional) Review all topics again, because at this point I have a lot of time to spare. 

**Example: Astronomy with pictures.** 

[Look at table, confused about The sun](https://preview.redd.it/rxrldzrdoywd1.png?width=1197&format=png&auto=webp&s=4be28bfc953de7ed0fe1f370e90ce36650fa3afa)

[Lets say i am confused on Gravitational potential energy, i click it ](https://preview.redd.it/opmn6i2koywd1.png?width=615&format=png&auto=webp&s=609ae83d279f8a74436cbbad4ac84718b667eed6)

[I then study this. If more information is needed, ill google it. ](https://preview.redd.it/kdeyss9poywd1.png?width=544&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e61efa4cd8d2a69ebeca6bd83e4821220762f08)

For astronomy, it was incredibly easy so I did not study anything. Because i enjoyed taking the notes, I already memorized them prior to the midterm. 

# Final Thoughts

My ratings are

1. Obsidian
2. OneNote
3. Anki
4. Notion

N/A - Remnote (Don't know how it is in its current state)

This should provide a general overview of my idea of how to study.

If you have any disagreements, please feel free to comment, i am open to learning the benefits of certain applications.

If you have any thoughts, also please comment!
