* **Specialist** Program: a sequence of between 10.0 and 14.0 credits in one or more disciplines (note that some interdisciplinary Specialist programs may require up to 16.0 credits). Specialist programs must include at least 4.0 credits from 300+ level courses, of which 1.0 credit must be at the 400 level. 
   * **Some programs don't offer a specialist. You will need to check.**
* **Major** Program: a sequence of between 6.0 and 8.0 credits in one or more disciplines. Major programs must include at least 2.0 credits from 300+ level courses, of which one 0.5 credit must be at the 400 level. 
   * **Most programs offer a Major.**
* **Minor** Program: a sequence of 4.0 credits in one or more disciplines. Minor programs must include at least 1.0 credit at the 300+ level. 

# What combination do I need to graduate??

* Students usually have a combo of something like this to graduate:
   * 2 Majors (English major + Philosophy major) **OR**
   * 1 Specialist (English specialist) **OR**
   * 1 Major and 2 Minors (Economics major + English Minor + Computer Science Minor)
* These are  the bare minimum requirements. You could do a specialist, 1 major and 1 minor if you wanted to, but its going to be a lot of work.

# Ask yourself:

What do you want to major/specialize in?

[https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/listing-program-subject-areas](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/listing-program-subject-areas)

Find the programs you want to do and then scroll down until you see something like for example this:

When you click on the one that you want to do, you can see what course combinations to take and all the info you need.

# Open Enrollment and Limited Enrollment Programs

* Open enrollment means that if you just took the an x number of credits of courses in your first year, you can just enroll in it without needing any pre-reqs or marks
   * Examples: Philosophy, Math, etc
* Limited enrollment means if you want to apply for the program, you need to take x, y, z courses and have a good/high average in those courses
   * Public Policy, Economics, Criminology, etc

# Course Load:

First year students are typically encouraged to the take normal/full course load which is 2.5 FCEs (credits) per semester which would be 5.0 FCEs for the full academic year.

Courses are worth either 1.0 credits or 0.5 credits.

* 1.0 credit courses are called FULL YEAR COURSES.
* 0.5 credit courses are called SINGLE SEMESTER COURSES.

**Question**: HOW DO I KNOW IF A COURSE IS 0.5 CREDITS OR 1.0 CREDITS?

* If the course has H1 at the end of the course code, it is 0.5. If it has a Y1 at the end of the course code, it is worth 1.0 credits.

# Select Courses

* Use the [timetable builder](https://ttb.utoronto.ca/) alongside the academic calendar that details your program requirements and courses you need to take.
* Switch the faculty/division to arts and science and the session to Fall-Winter 2024-2025.
* After, you can filter by department/subject area (this is the place where you would put what program you are interested in like Economics, or Philosophy or Biology)

* Plan out your courses through this timetable planner after reading through the academic calendar and figuring out what courses you need for whatever program you want to do.
* **MAKE SURE YOU TAKE PRE-REQ COURSES FROM OTHER PROGRAMS TO FILL OUT YOUR TIMETABLE IF YOU HAVE SPACE SO THAT YOU HAVE A BACK UP IN CASE YOU DONT MAKE THE LIMITED ENROLLMENT PROGRAM YOU WANT.**
* Make sure you download/save your timetable after you make it as it doesn't auto save and will reset if you refresh it.

# Acorn

* Now that you have your timetable with the courses you need/want to take on ACORN, navigate to the “Enrol & Manage” tab and add your selected courses to your cart.
* ADDING COURSES TO YOUR CART DOES NOT ENROLL YOU IN THOSE COURSES.
* YOU WILL GET OR YOU MAY ALREADY HAVE GOTTEN A COURSE ENROLLMENT DATE AND TIME on the main page of Acorn.
   * MAKE SURE YOU ARE PREPARED TO MANUALLY ENROLL IN THE COURSES RIGHT WHEN IT OPENS OTHERWISE YOU MIGHT NOT GET THE COURSES YOU WANT.

Thats basically it. You can comment if you have any questions but most of your questions can probably be answered if you read the above.",submission,63

Just a small thing tho, 1.0 Credit courses are not always full-year. such as CSC110Y1. The Y means 1 credit but it doesn't necessarily specify full year or one term.",comment,1
