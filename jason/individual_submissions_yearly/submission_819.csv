Writing down each of the slide titles ahead of time and looking at any associated images (and adding them to my notes) really helped to prime my brain for the material that will be covered during lecture that day.

If your instructor has a bad habit of posting lecture slides late, get a general idea of what your topic that day for lecture will be and skim through the readings for it if you have the textbook or associated resources like research articles.

During the lecture, it's less about transcribing everything being spoken and more about connecting the things you already understand with things that are novel or interesting. I tended to only take notes on things the lecturer said that I've never heard before or that I can connect to something that I've already learned. Writing everything down is typically a waste of time and effort so don't stress if you feel you missed something.",comment,12

Choose one and add your own style. Try your best to write notes entirely in your own words. basically that's it and good luck! (you can also try mind mapping but that's hard to do in lecs),comment,4

Prepare for classes beforehand by reviewing the material as listed in the syllabus, if possible. Review previous material (such as from the previous class) before class begins. Copying the slides verbatim doesn't do much for me; I add my own notes or observations to information provided by the instructor. Concentration and preparation are two key steps that will definitely help.

Keeping in-class distractions (such as browsing other sites/apps) during class to a minumum is good advice as well.",comment,1

I would say, focus on writing down items that aren‚Äôt on the slides or posted materials ‚Äî ways to help future you comprehend a concept faster (maybe an analogy or trick the prof mentions verbally). Also another tip is to use abbreviations in a course where long-terms are constantly used and are a hassle to write down each time (ie in linear algebra, if you‚Äôve ever taken it). Essentially, try to limit the time you spend away from actively listening and paying attention to the prof.

The biggest thing to AVOID during note-taking is to copy down everything mindlessly. You have to understand that primary learning happens from listening attentively and making an effort to learn in-person. Don‚Äôt glue yourself to making sure you write down every little word exactly as said ‚Äî you‚Äôll end up realizing you wrote everything down, but understand nothing. 

The best way to improve is to go back and reflect on your notes (actually read what you wrote after class and see if they are useful to you, or what you need to focus on). If you realize you cannot read or digest what you wrote, maybe focus on better writing next time. If you realize you don‚Äôt know what each note is about, maybe add headers etc,. 

I personally have never used any fancy formatting or note taking techniques and I doubt anyone needs to. Lastly! If you write digitally as most people including myself do, it‚Äôs hard to commit information straight to active recall. Before an exam or test I suggest hand writing the notes once again for review and better recall.",comment,1

You can Google how to do them and they even have notebooks designed for Cornell. I used to scribble down so much stuff. Then Someone said to me (he was a really good student) that he tried to stick to the rule of thumb (not strict) of one page of notes per hour. While I wasn‚Äôt too strict on this rule, it made me be more discriminate about what I wrote down and I listened and thus absorbed way more during lecture. And I actually thought more about what was important enough to write down.",comment,1

As for taking notes, what I do recommend is 
1. Asking the professor if you can record(Audio(make sure to emphasize audio recording, it‚Äôs your legal right, but overall nice in general to ask the professor beforehand)) of the lecture for personal/private use. 
2. If you do take notes, try to only write down emphasis points, for example: Things that the prof would highlight as being important, or graphs(for Econ..) 
3. Rather than writing full sentences, you can jot down your notes in point form. 

Here‚Äôs an example using my explanation: 1. Audio rec (ask prof) 2. Write only key points 3. Point form X sentence

And lastly, you can utilize the outer god(AI)‚Äôs powers by using some AI note taker that takes notes through listening the lecture. Keep in mind that this might be considered as an academic offense etc etc depending on the professor or department‚Äôs opinion. Tread with caution.

I wouldn‚Äôt suggest typing since that gives absolute zero recall, you won‚Äôt even moderately remember what you wrote. With an iPad I find I can usually recall what I wrote but not everything, paper and pencil beats everything for memory and recall (probably because you have to think before you write to avoid having to erase and be more mindful about pressure, page size, handwriting etc,.)",comment,1
