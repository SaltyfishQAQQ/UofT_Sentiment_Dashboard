In your third and fourth year most people streamline their interest even more, sometimes you even do a complete 180.

All this to say; being at University and having your majors/interest change over time is generally a good thing.",comment,10

5. biochem specialist

Now: biochem major, psych minor, bio minor

When I actually took the courses I needed to get into my planned program, I liked them, and did well. That confirmed it for me that I was in the right program. After second year equivalent courses were done (I was part time after first year) I decided I needed environmental studies as well, and added a minor as it could fit in my degree. 

I was a mature student, and had a good idea what I wanted before I even applied. When I finished high school I had ideas of what I wanted, started and dropped out of two college programs that would have led to careers.  If you’re still young, 21 or under, accept that you will change what you want as you grow, learn, and continue to mature.",comment,4

I felt econ was too theoretical for my liking and wasn’t aligned with my endeavors (more tech), as opposed to stats. Also, i was taking the advanced 2nd year econ courses (206, 208, 227) and did horribly on 206 and 208 for some reason haha, as opposed to stats. Econ simply wasn’t my calling. But I’m already in too deep so I’m just getting the major and taking stats-heavy econ courses.

Also, love math! But while i was taking the required upper year math courses, i felt they weren’t aligned with my goals as well, so I’m doing the minor to allow for more course flexibility.",comment,1
