 I had a similar experience in the library a couple of weeks ago, I literally had to wear headphones  ðŸ˜­

And now, every time I  think about the person, that's the first thing that comes up in my mind",comment,10

You also have to remember that in some cultures, itâ€™s actually rude to eat with your mouth closed/to not make any noise when eating (e.g., Chinese culture).

Itâ€™s off-putting, I get it, but I guess you just have to remember that the other person isnâ€™t trying to offend you. If itâ€™s a dealbreaker for a friendship, thatâ€™s totally fine, everyone has their limits on what they will or will not tolerate.",comment,5
