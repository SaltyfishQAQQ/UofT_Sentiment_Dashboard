As the title states I really need laptop advice for my first year. 
I’ll be in the social sciences studying a variety of things like econ,physc, IR, ect and I need a reliable laptop that will last me for my four years (or close to it) and works well for students. 
I’m going to have to buy one in the next few days so any advice is appreciated.
Thanks 
EDIT; my budget is 1,000",submission,19

Even in my program different people get different laptops (some Windows, some Mac, of various specs) and most of them are fine. I'm not familiar with social science but I guess most people there don't do crazy things with their laptops like engineers do, so I'd say any new laptop from a reliable brand should last you 4 years (personally I had a \~$1100 thinkpad from 2012 that lasted 7 years, and a \~$800 renewed dell laptop from 2018 that I used for 5 years and can still boot at this time.) Anything that can run web browser and office software should be okay, although in rare cases, Windows operating system can provide compatibility for some professional software. Hope this helps\~",comment,10

Also, consider that MACs are more expensive to repair/upgrade and almost much more difficult to repair yourself. Lastly, if you are the kinda person who likes to tinker around with advanced settings in the OS (for example, registry edits) and want the freedom to use your laptop as you wish, Windows provides more flexibility than MAC OS.

I'd say, from my experience, that Lenovo laptops usually offer the most bang for the buck in terms of hardware specs and performance in your price range, but they usually cheap out on build quality, hinge durability, etc. They also don't have physical stores in my city, so if anything goes wrong, I have to ship out my laptop and wait a couple of weeks for them to send it back. I suggest you look into that for whichever brand you want to buy if you plan to purchase online. If you buy from a store like BestBuy, you can get a GeekSquad extended warranty or something - but I don't have any experience with it, and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

I'd honestly look at channels such as Linus Tech Tips, Jarrod'sTech, and Dave2D to do my own research. After shortlisting a few candidates, I'd go to Best Buy or other stores and physically see the laptops, compare the online deals for the products I like, and then decide what to buy and where.",comment,2

(P.S, I recommend a Samsung tablet or if you can spend a bit more money, an I pad. As a u of t student you get a small discount on apple products. Personally I'm getting a Samsung Galaxy tab s6 lite with a keyboard. It comes with a pen which I'll use for note taking and drawing)",comment,2

The additional $200-300 dollars will save you from lag frustrations. 

My personal opinion: acer and hp. Highly recommend both brands, as they have great performance around 800 dollars.

Try going to Best Buy in person, tell them exactly what you said in this post, and they will help you out. 

If you can't do that, just remember that the brand doesn't matter as much as the specs of each laptop.",comment,1
