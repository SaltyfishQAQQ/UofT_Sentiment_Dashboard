I haven't personally found any other pen-and-paper alternatives (in terms of writing speed) for technical notes, so I thought it might also be useful to someone else.

You can give it a try at¬†[https://www.stempad.io/editor.](https://www.stempad.io/editor)¬†The editor is free to use (no sign up) and you can export to PDF and latex. In the gif I show the math block, graph block, image block, code block, chemistry block, circuit block, draw block, and table block. I'm going to add more blocks soon, if anyone has any suggestions I'd really appreciate it! I‚Äôd love your feedback.",comment,20

Are the latex blocks here true latex? And follow up, are/will you be able to import latex packages?",comment,1

just wanted to lyk that the links to the building blocks in squircle icons on [stempad.io/learn](https://www.stempad.io/learn) (under *""üîç  How is Stempad different?""*) currently lead to 404 pages :(

- e.g. right now they link to, say, [stempad.io/learn/math](https://www.stempad.io/learn/math) (which 404s), but they're probably supposed to link to [stempad.io/learn/blocks/math](https://www.stempad.io/learn/blocks/math)",comment,1

It is meant to be a WYSIWYG editor, so latex would kind of defeat that purpose. None of what you see above is powered by latex, short of the math block which you can paste latex into.

You can however export your documents to latex after you're done editing!",comment,1
