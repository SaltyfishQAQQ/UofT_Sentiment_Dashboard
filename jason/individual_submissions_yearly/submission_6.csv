Many of the people in the Pride parade are protesting something or another. They do so peacefully and within the rules, they are cheered and their movement gets the attention it deserves. 

No Pride in Genocide decided that their topic deserved the right to deprive every other protest group attention. They deprived new gay immigrants from their chance to walk in the parade. They deprived a large portion of *community* groups rather than the corporate groups they were protesting from being able to march in the parade. 

It is an act of extraordinary narcissism to believe that your movement is more important than *any* other movement in such a space. It is an act of extraordinary foolishness to throw away people who are allies because they cannot give you *everything* that you want. 

No. These people are bad-faith actors. Their movement deserves to be snuffed out, despite my fundamental agreement with their topic. 

It‚Äôs a pity. However, if they are intending to harm other minorities for attention, make unreasonable demands, and harm people who have done nothing more than support them (but not enough for the radical wing, it‚Äôs never enough); then they deserve the scorn I give them.

Stonewall was not the start of the gay rights movement. That started with the homophile associations post-WW2. 

Stonewall started the Gay Liberation Front which was very explicitly not a single-issue movement. They named themselves after the Vietnamese and Algerian National Liberation Fronts.

The activists, like Martha Shelley (who's still alive & has spoken out about Israel's bombing of Gaza!) and Bob Kohler, were extremely radical-- many were communists. They allied themselves with Women's Lib, the Black Panther Party, and the Anti-War movement, supported the Cuban Revolution and decolonial movements abroad. They embodied the slogan ""None of us are free until all of us are free"".

To suggest that the activists in No Pride in Genocide are betraying the meaning of pride shows a complete lack of knowledge of where pride comes from. If anyone is betraying the meaning of pride, it's PrideTO which has completely watered down the meaning, takes money from corporations profiting off of war, and who sticks all the community groups at the back of the parade behind these corporations. 

All this could have been avoided, just like in 2016 when BLM did the same thing as No Pride in Genocide, if PrideTO was committed to open dialogue with the communities it purports to represent.

But it's not, and so here we are.",comment,12

3) This argument is lazy and trite. It gets rolled out every time someone thinks that their issue is THE issue and that other issues should take a back seat. There are a lot of issues in Toronto and within the LGBTQ community that deserve attention. This issue barely even affects the LGBTQ community of Toronto.

Then it was followed up by the exploitation of a loophole so that two same sex folk could get married. 

Pride in Canada also evolved. We got blindsided when we won marriage, something we never asked the government for. We activists, radicals that we were, never considered the value that marriage would have in normalizing queer voices. 

We grew in power and authority and eventually we ‚Äúwon,‚Äù as much as any minority had ever won in a culture dominated by normalization. 

That is the history of Pride in Canada. We didn‚Äôt throw stones. Yes, we protested, but we tried to leave space for everyone. In Pride committees we curbed the tendencies of radicals to ruin events because they always thought they were SO important. And their adamant self-importance would silence other groups who also belonged at the table.

See, I‚Äôve lived a fair bit of the history of Pride. I know the man who ran this group. I know that he organized this sit-in as a hissy fit because he didn‚Äôt get what he wanted. I know that this was little more than him attempting to embarrass the people in Toronto Pride that disagreed with him. Yet Toronto Pride still let them march because that is part of giving everyone a place at the table. 

What did they do? They flipped the table. 

Pride means many things to many people, and because the LGBTQ community is so diverse it belongs to all of us and none of us. However, certainly it does not belong to a single group of protesters who have ruined it for everyone else because they believe that they are so important. Their actions were an action to silence other groups who had an arguably, larger and more important issues that need to be addressed within the context of Toronto. This organization has brought shame upon itself by using the tools of oppression, leaving no space for anyone else to speak, in order to bring attention to a peripheral issue to the LGBTQ community of Toronto. 

It is a disgusting use of power. It is an obvious tactic of a self-aggrandizing oppressor. And for this reason, amongst many others, I say this unto you: shame.",comment,12

He glances at these issues by admitting that money was taken for the purposes of reintroducing the police to Pride, but not that the director he supported resulted in Pride Toronto having to return millions to various grant organizations because that director was totally corrupt. 

What he was asking for from Pride Toronto this year would be a poison pill to the organization and would decimate their accounts. Between the two incidents, one wonders if that is his goal.

There will always be an argument that Pride should be community focused (I generally agree), but that doesn‚Äôt empower one group to speak for us all. Certainly not on this issue. Certainly not through the silencing of other protest groups behind them. 

He violated the fundamental rule of the LGBTQ community, ‚Äúyou are not so important that you speak for all of us.‚Äù We are a diverse group of people who, uniquely, are born entirely separate from our community and into families that are typically unlike us. No single person, or even a small group of people, may speak for us all or has the right to silence any of us because they believe they are so important. 

He left. He can shut up any time now. 

Certainly he will never be welcomed by Toronto Pride again. And good riddance.",comment,21

Consider that all of the pro-Palestine movements have been curtailed and are in the process of being removed.

The current form of Pride attracts literally millions of people to support our community. It draws in open support from politicians of many stripes, people of nearly every ethnicity, people of nearly every religion. The ‚Äúgrassroots‚Äù movements that these hero‚Äôs wish to return back to cannot claim the same, and they were nearly always dominated by white cis-folk. Pride Toronto also draws in a huge degree support from corporations (yes, they are part of Pride as well), and it is justifiable a celebration of our long-fought and ever-at-risk freedom. If corporations wish to fund it so that it can be open to everyone, so be it. 

Palestine is, at best, a peripheral issue to the LGBTQ movement in Canada. There are significantly more important and pressing issues to Canada‚Äôs LGBTQ community that deserve significantly more attention than No Pride in Genocide unjustly seized. 

I have already agreed in other comments that a grassroots parade would be nice, and it does in fact exist in some of the side parades that occur over the weekend.  However, we are no longer in the 80s and we have ‚Äúwon,‚Äù whatever that means. That means we can celebrate, and protest, together. That doesn‚Äôt mean that one group EVER has the right to try to speak for us all or to derail the right for all of us to speak if we so choose. 

This is why I‚Äôm specifically furious with No Pride in Genocide, and BLM peripherally, for the use of this tactic. It is a tactic of silencing others who also have the right to speak. It is the equivalent of yelling so loud that no one else can be heard. That is adamantly NOT what Pride, or even a community, is about. That is what our oppressors do to us.

He had enemies on the committee, and so he picked up his toys and planned a protest to embarrass his enemies on the committee. 

Because pride is all about giving everyone a seat at the table, even the riskier ones, Pride still allowed his group to march. Rather than behave, he flipped the table and ruined it for everyone. 

His politics are not the point. His personality is. He didn‚Äôt do this for political gain, he did it for spite. He dressed it up in a political motive, because many people who are bad-faith actors do, but he did it because he was angry. If he had cared about not bending the knee to corporate sponsors then he would have held his director to the letter of the contract for the grants that she embezzled. That would have given Pride latitude to be less reliant on sponsors because they would have had grant money not associated with major corporations. He didn‚Äôt do that. Thus Pride became even more reliant on sponsors because they had to return huge sums of money they no longer had. 

There are multiple grassroots parades and events that happen during Pride and that Pride sponsors. They are small, as those types of events tend to be. That he would want all of Pride to become that shows his serious lack of comprehension for how power works in this country. 

By playing ball with these sponsors, drawing in the attention of millions, and ensuring a spectacle worthy of the attention of Canadians we ensure that we are safe. We increase the exposure of the LGBTQ community to the wider Canadian society and we show ourselves to be approachable and worthy our dealing with. In a neo-liberal society, that is the essence of power and legitimacy. We then spend that political capital on our safety and our political needs. 

That the pro-Palestine movements have been unable to gain any traction ANYWHERE sore that they utterly misunderstand the mechanics of power in Canada. That Pride provides an umbrella for grass-roots movements to co exist within it shows that we can have both.
