However, the stats dept has already created new roles regarding this problem, e.g., they assigned a new ""international student academic lead"" for STA313. Both the department and the course team are investigating this persisting issue. 

As an international kid myself, I am ashamed of what my people are pulling here. I believe if we work together as students voluntarily, report all their on-campus advertising, tear down their posters, tell them how wrongful their activities are when we see them, report potential affiliating students to the course and the dept, etc., \*\*hypothetically\*\*, this issue will get better.",comment,13

EZ edu is not affiliated with UofT and can't be held to academic integrity standards, and their service isn't technically illegal. the only way uoft can counter is if they sue them for usage of copyright materials (lecture slides, past exams, etc. that these ""tutoring"" services are using to help students cheat). i would love to see these students get placed on probation/expulsion or these EZ edu workers being prosecuted and extradited back to china though idgaf. blatant cheating harms the academic community as a whole and should be dealt with accordingly.",comment,21

I joined both initially, but shortly after I left without telling them. 

I have witnessed related scenes (i.e. people advertising their services and asking me to join WeChat servers) every single semester during my university career. They just wont stop advertising.

Sometimes the people affiliated with those companies DM me as well, and I just R-bomb (or O-bomb) their texts and disable their moments on WeChat as their moments are nothing but repetitive advertisements.",comment,1
