I’m not sure what to do while on a year of probation ,pencink,1fzqavw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fzqavw/im_not_sure_what_to_do_while_on_a_year_of/,1728477212.0,"I fucked up and my GPA fell so I’m on probation. I have a part time job and I’m learning C in my year off, but what else am I supposed to do?

Before I go back I want to learn to study, focus, take notes, try to get an internship, anything useful. I can’t attend most learning workshop stuff and events on campus because I’m not enrolled in classes. I enrolled in some hackathons and am working on a personal project as well. 

I just feel so lost and unsure on where to continue bc I don’t want to be a sitting duck falling behind.",submission,48

1) This is the perfect time to work on your start up/ side hustle. Doesn't need to be a hit, just having that on your resume and for your self will be a great experience.  
2) Build your own portfolio website  
3) Network with people in industry  
4) Tutor  
5) Invest in a hobby that you won't get time for when back to school  
6)Study in advance for the hard classes you will take next year  
7) Most importantly, take some time to zoom out and see what you want to do in life and with this degree. Use this as the time to pivot or plan your next 5-6 years.",comment,43

One that requires you to be some place on time, work hard, work on stuff that doesn't always excite you (or even interest you), work with people you don't always understand or necessarily like.  Make it as pleasant and constructive an experience as you can for yourself and for your workplace.  And keep the job for a good period of time.

This will give you life skills that you can't get easily in the classroom, skills that will pay off more broadly.  Including in the classroom (it will increase your time-management skills, your self-discipline skills, your grind skills, and your people skills, for example.)

I've  seen people who worked unsexy jobs, (as a janitor, for example) get interviewed for highly competitive graduate CS programs while other candidates with side-hustle (but no proof of workplace skills) got passed over .

edit: I should have written that getting a \*full-time\* job would be good.  Part-time's a great start, of course.",comment,13

That probation didn't come out of nowhere, there is a reason deep down.

Use the 1-2 months to really reflect before jumping into other things like side hustles",comment,3

I got a working holiday visa for the uk and took off for two years. The idea of falling behind is a false narrative - you are obviously moving forward. Stop comparing yourself to others. It doesn’t matter what other people do.,comment,3

Enjoy life. Go out there and have fun, get some drinks and live a little. Instead of thinking of it as falling behind and burning yourself out more forcing yourself to take courses and do projects, treat it as a gap year between hs and uni. I was like you for the first month or so. I was really upset because a lot of the ppl I knew were getting co-ops and getting ahead on classes. Think about the reason why you went on probation in the first place. Learning habits, time management, load management even?
Once you figured that out, take some time. I understand that it feels like you're falling behind it makes you want to force yourself to do more work to catch but remember you have a year now. I told myself that I will enjoy this year but I will go back and work my ass off.
Now I'm not saying be a bum for a year, I did a project here and there and I learned a few languages which maybe? helped a little... idek. Because it's difficult to self learn at the same rigorous pace as taking classes and I ended up forgetting a lot of it. Anyways... the point is go at a comfortable pace and don't stress too much and have fun with it.",comment,4
