Summer is a pretty quiet time for entry level CS grad jobs. If you missed your mark in the winter it should pick up again towards the fall.

Also, where are you having trouble? Are you not getting interviews, or are you just not getting offers? If you're not landing interviews then your resume is probably a mess, and you probably want to have an pro look at it. That said, having a UofT degree should help you land those interviews, but you still have to impress the people interviewing you, and their expectations are likely to be higher than if you had come from a less (in)famous university.",comment,8

Companies have opted to hire people from referrals only since there are too many resumes. And people lie on the resume and it costs them money for background checks. 

So do networking and get referred. 

Other than that my only suggestion is, continue to improve your skills and make sure that it is visible. I am talking about getting linkedin, twitter, and your own website. Even youtube will help your branding and visibility. 

It might be a good idea to do masters while you wait for the market to improve. But maybe it wont cause canada is planning to increase their immigration since they believe there is a labour shortage.

What I meant to get across is that there is a lot that’s dependent on luck. Also was trying to get across that coop experience doesn’t mean you’ll get a full-time offer any easier. At this point every graduating student has done some form of an internship, it’s turned into the norm. 

More over, other than just improving your resume/acknowledging and improving what aspects your lagging behind in. There is not much else you can do — it’s either you have connections, luck or a meaningful internship (which can give you a return offer). 
 
No degree is ever passed on as employable with certainty. And specifically with CS, it’s employability was in the air for the past couple of years — more so now where GPT essentially makes everyone “experienced” in just about everything related to software. 

Best bet? Try pivoting into something more niche or related to software but not directly popular. And get yourself a job to pay the bills for now.",comment,1

A lot of the mass immigration is occurring through diploma mills, the students that graduate from these schools meet the requirements on paper but in reality they don’t, companies know that and will never hire them.

It doesn’t prevent them from still applying to these same jobs, leading to the other mentioned issue where companies only hire from referrals as a way to filter applicants.",comment,9
