"What happens now, after the encampment has been dissolved?",satoniou,1dw0b9h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dw0b9h/what_happens_now_after_the_encampment_has_been/,1720192387.0,"Given the emails from the president, my understanding is that they were pursuing two paths to resolve the encampment situation. First was getting the injunction and clearing out the encampment, which is what happened. But the second (if that even was an option for them to begin with) was to have some committee to discuss the ""disclose & divest"" situation (this is my understanding at least, correct if I'm wrong pls). 

Given the title, I'm confused as to what happens to this second option now. Is UofT just not gonna do anything about it and pretend nothing happened, or are they still talking with some of the people involved (if they ever were talking with them)? If anyone has any info on that, would appreciate. ",submission,87

"What happens now, after the encampment has been dissolved?",Orchid-Analyst-550,lbs235r,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dw0b9h/what_happens_now_after_the_encampment_has_been/lbs235r/,1720203545.0,"The judge basically laid it out in their ruling:

>The overall goal of the protesters is to get the University to divest from certain investments.  The University has procedures in place to consider those sorts of requests.  The University has offered to help the protesters pursue that process on an expedited basis. The protesters have had considerable success in shining a bright light on what universities should or should not invest in.  They have succeeded in catching everyone’s attention and in obtaining an expedited process.

>It is now time for the protesters to peacefully dismantle the encampment and focus their energies on building support within the group that will investigate divestment and within the broader University community to persuade both groups that divestment is a worthy goal.  Persuasion will not be achieved through occupation but through reasoned discussion.  If the respondents bring the same attention and focus to that exercise as they have to the encampment, they may yet achieve their goal.

My reading is that the judge expects the protestors to follow the university's procedure to investigate divestment. If you look at the procedure used by the climate activist's to divest from fossil fuels, there will be a committee to examine divestment and make a recommendation. In 2016 they recommended divestment, but Gertler veto it. That's why these current protesters accused the university of negotiating in bad faith. He eventually back pedaled years later, and as of 2022, the university has divested from fossil fuels, and is working on divesting from indirect investments by 2030.

This is especially as there has been a scholasticide throughout affected regions where every single university in Gaza has been destroyed by the IDF.

I’m certain that protests and dialogues will continue until UofT commits to divest from Israeli universities (e.g., there is a scholarship to study in Jerusalem that was advertised around Vic campus) and companies that are supporting the apartheid regime.
