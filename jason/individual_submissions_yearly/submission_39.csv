U of T abuses its students and treats them like crap,bigsmokememery,1esoaey,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1esoaey/u_of_t_abuses_its_students_and_treats_them_like/,1723703555.0,"I attended the University of Toronto at the St. George campus from September 2016 to January 2019. I can tell you from experience that U of T treats its students like dog crap. Many of my peers took 5-6 years to graduate rather than the standard 4. This is no accident - U of T overloads its students with coursework in order to make them fail/retake courses and to take more of their (their parents') money. Some professors try to resist this immoral system, but U of T's administration threatens to fire them if they don't comply. Many hard-working, intelligent, and ambitious students attend the University of Toronto. Many of them are first or second generation Canadians who come from poor or underprivileged backgrounds and are trying to get a decent education in the hopes of getting a decent job later. U of T exploits these kinds of students without any kind of restraint or remorse. 

The truth is, a lot of evil lives at the University of Toronto. Much of it comes from people like Merrick Gertler and rest of the U of T administration, who act with great cruelty towards their students. During my time at the U of T, I suffered anxiety attacks, watched the university take vast sums of money from wealthy Chinese students, and saw first year Economics professors brag to my face about how most of their students fail their course and have to take it again several times just to enter their desired major. I also saw many students, including myself, who came to U of T thinking that their desired major was a given, only to have to compete in the unethical POST system to try and enter their desired major. 

None of this is normal. None of this is OK. After having studied at the University of Arizona for 3 years, I understand what it's like for a university to treat its students with decency, love, and respect. I knew no such feeling at the U of T. All I knew there was deception, abuse, and neglect. For all of you U of T kids who know in your souls that how this university treats its students is very far from acceptable, I want you to know that your intuition is correct. None of this is OK.

I hope that one day, the University of Toronto will change its terrible ways. Unfortunately, it doesn't look like this will happen anytime soon. Poor immigrants keep coming to Canada in search of a better life, and their children keep displaying the ambition that will one day lead them to U of T despite the dire warnings of their peers. Wealthy Chinese parents continue to be willing to pay enormous sums for a chance to send their children to the West. And so the cycle continues. 

I'll never forget the feeling of sitting in a lecture room at U of T, watching a professor lecture, and feeling like  U of T is trying to crush me into dust. To say that this experience isn't normal would be a big understatement. Anyways, I just wanted to say all of this because I think that it's about time that someone told the truth about the University of Toronto. ",submission,416

The problem with UofT is that the culture is much different. World class researchers from around the world apply for professorship here. It’s a totally different level than the other Ontarian universities.

Because of the institution’s immense research culture, the professors tend to be poor teachers for undergrads, either due to 1) lack of interest for teaching, 2) too busy with research, or 3) neurodivergent or antisocial personality that is conductive for research but not for teaching. You have to understand that teaching is a job that is forced upon professors. Yes, while it is part of the job description, the vast majority of professors despise having to teach because they believe that it distracts them from their primary job. Some universities are trying to change this mindset (such as Western), but its difficult when you’re hiring only the top researchers in the entire country. 

I also have gripes with how UofT handles its courses. There are far too many students and not enough TA’s. This university is simply overwhelmed and as a result the undergrad experience is suffering.

UofT definitely knows this is a major problem and is starting to hire “teaching-stream” professors, who are PhD-level experts whose sole focus is to teach multiple courses at the undergrad and graduate level. This will alleviate the work-load on research professors and improve the experience for undergrads. UofT knows that it has a poor reputation among high school students that want to go into medicine or law, where undergraduate GPA reigns supreme for admission chances. The university has to act proactively before their revenue from admissions dips.",comment,141

I understand the rant, but I heavily disagree with this. I spent more years of my childhood living below the poverty line than above. I remember my moms income the first year I applied to OSAP was $28,000.

For my first 3 years UofT gave me around $20,000 in scholarships and bursaries, and OSAP around $10,000. My 4th year was PEY, where I made $70,000 - that was more money than my mom had ever made.

My new grad job pays so much I'm literally doing the math on retiring a decade early. Whenever I see shit like this I can't help but think how in most of the world a story like mine isn't possible.

UofT didn't exploit me man, they gave me opportunities I couldn't even dream of. It's the highest ranked university in the country, I'm not sure why you expected it to be easy.",comment,177

You didn't even try to do the bare minimum amount of research regarding how program enrolment works before you applied to and accepted your offer from UofT? The PoST system was not some hidden secret that they don't tell you about until orientation, it's very easily accessible information.

It seems like you aren't willing to take responsibility for your own shortcomings as a student, since you want to call every issue that you experienced a systemic ""evil"" of the university. Maybe you're just not cut out for an academically rigorous university.

Also why do you hate Chinese international students so much? At least some of them are able to keep up with the academic pressures of the university. You just seem like you're bitter because you can't cope with your own failures from more than 5 years ago and you prefer to blame everyone else instead of looking inward.",comment,31

well that's not 100% True if you come into your first year with a clear goal, for example, if you are an out-of-stream student trying to get into CS ( arguably the hardest POST situation to be in) you only need a definitive high grade in 2 courses and if you look throw past year grades many students got 95+ in both those courses ( basically a guarantee in making cs POST) but sure if you start your first year have no clue what you want to major in skip half lecture and drop 3 courses you will have a hard time",comment,6

Yes, there are downsides to how UofT works (I'm not saying that there aren't), but there is absolutely no reason to expect that the course load will be that of a high school level.

You get in first year and you get a chance to see what it's like, but if you can't cut it, it doesn't get any easier as you move up. Honestly the POST system probably prevents a lot of students from getting too far into a degree they're not cut out for. If you're capable of achieving something, it doesn't matter how many times you have to compete, you'll achieve it. 

Unfortunately this is kind of prep for the real world. If you can't cut it you don't get the job, and if you have to go a few steps down and get a job somewhere else that's fine, but it doesn't mean the super prestigious jobs are trying to slight you.",comment,3

Correct. They let in too many low level students into useless/ saturated fields to cash in on first year fees. 

>U of T overloads its students with coursework in order to make them fail/retake courses and to take more of their (their parents’) money. 

They don’t overload. It’s the appropriate load, students are simply not good enough/ uni material.

>Some professors try to resist this immoral system, but U of T’s administration threatens to fire them if they don’t comply. 

Source? I’ve never heard of this at all. And I have very intimate knowledge of the administration and faculty.

>The truth is, a lot of evil lives at the University of Toronto. Much of it comes from people like Merrick Gertler and rest of the U of T administration, who act with great cruelty towards their students. 

What cruelty do they do?

>first year Economics professors brag to my face about how most of their students fail their course and have to take it again several times just to enter their desired major. 

I’ve never met a professor who bragged. Feel free to report them however. It’s not the appropriate conduct.

>I also saw many students, including myself, who came to U of T thinking that their desired major was a given, only to have to compete in the unethical POST system to try and enter their desired major. 

Yea I’ll give you that. They lie in their admission letter. It happened to me and my sibling.

>None of this is normal. None of this is OK. After having studied at the University of Arizona for 3 years, I understand what it’s like for a university to treat its students with decency, love, and respect. I knew no such feeling at the U of T. All I knew there was deception, abuse, and neglect. For all of you U of T kids who know in your souls that how this university treats its students is very far from acceptable, I want you to know that your intuition is correct. None of this is OK.

>Wealthy Chinese parents continue to be willing to pay enormous sums for a chance to send their children to the West. And so the cycle continues. 

There is definitely a conversation to be had about letting in too many international kids, wealthy Chinese or otherwise…",comment,2

UofT it would seem was not a good fit for you. That doesn't mean that they ""abuse"" their students. 

First the vast majority of students both in Canada and the US do not graduate in 4 years which is why the typical reporting metric is 6 years. Secondly UofT has a 91% first year retention rate and an 81% 6 year graduation rate which doesn't support your weed out narrative or that of them taking advantage of poor first and second generation students. You can not apply your American ""first gen"" lens to the Canadian educational system as Canada does not suffer from as extensive a degree of economic disparity and inequality of education that the US does.  

It would appear that you were also experiencing a high degree of culture shock as evidenced by your claim of UofT ""overloading their students"". While Canada and the US appear on the surface to share many cultural similarities, the field of education is not one of them. The rigour of academics at Canadian high schools and universities is quite frequently higher than it is at many in the US and it would appear that you were unprepared for that. American students are also used to a greater degree of hand holding. Canadian universities expect their students to be adults capable of managing academics independently and able to advocate for their own needs. That by the way isn't unique to Canadian universities either. That's the expectation of universities in many countries outside of the US. If you found UofT difficult you certainly could not have handled attending university in Germany.  

With regards to your claim that UofT is exploiting international students for profit. Pot meet kettle. U of Arizona does the exact same thing with it's graduate programs.

Finally UofT didn't cause your anxiety. Your maladaptive strategies for coping with stress did that. I'm sure being away from home was also a contributing factor. Instead of trying to blame external factors for your in ability to cope I would recommend that you seek professional help, something that you should have done back when you were a student. And you're right when you say that feeling like ""U of T is trying to crush me into dust"" isn't normal, nor is it what the vast majority of students attending UofT experience. I'm sorry that you did, but that's a you issue. The sooner you shed the victim mentality and start to take responsibility for your own mental health and stop attributing your struggles to external forces, the happier you'll be. The fact that you're still dwelling on this 5 years later and haven't been able to move on is just a further indication that you may be in need of professional mental health counselling.",comment,2

Of course you won't get sympathy here. Most UofT students are a bunch of cucks who will grow up to take abuse from their employers.

Problem is UOFT is special when it comes to accepting students, unlike prestigious unis in the US, UOFT is ready to admit students with mediocre qualifications, if you compare the amount of workload and skill you need to enter a uni such as Harvard or MIT and then compare it to UOFT it’s day and night. Many of my friends here said they even managed to get into this uni with a high 70s average! This is absolutely ridiculous, I’m not saying people don’t deserve to study here, not at all, what I’m saying is this uni admits a large number of students with mediocre performance and then applies immense pressure and workload on them in an effort to collect more money for themselves, knowing that these students will most likely need more time to graduate, which results in all the issues you described leading to a terrible uni experience, if this Uni actually became more exclusive and only accepted top tier performance students many of these issues would just drop.

Professor pedagogy, the institution of U of T, and overwork 2. Wealthy and poor immigrants/visitors and the entitlement to get a free or cheap education; 2. Poor mental health. Anecdotally, I have heard this all; however, I've heard it said about all universities over decades. Maybe it wasn't a problem in the 80s and 90s, but since boomers got into teaching, it has been problematic. lol. Maybe look to that cohort for the source of this trouble. Other than that, PhD graduates receive pedagogy course training, which tells them how much work to give us--which means that younger graduates and PhD students tend to pile on the work, while older boomer professors do the same. Silent gen professors, few around, tend to be quite chill, and millennials are hit and miss (because most are the PhD cohorts now). Maybe going to have to wait until Gen Z's hit the PhD student phase to see change! lol. What I can say is that if U of T doesn't break you, it makes you, and we're all in this together. if I were a hiring manager--I would go for the B-level students because they understand the importance of life/work balance. A level might be best for director and executive positions. Most students can achieve B- (which is the U of T bell curve standard); however, there are some courses and programs that slaughter students and are purposefully grade deflating because when we see course or test averages of under B-, something is going wrong--very wrong and should be addressed by the administration and not just bell-curved to the B-. The artificial grade deflating happens for several reasons, including making it harder for students to enter a competitive program or to make a program appear to be the best, and to attract the genius' of the world. lol, Unfortunately, this behavior impacts students' mental health and well-being at a time when they're becoming adults and still maturing. It's a bit of a recipe for disaster and can lead to CPTSD, like it seems you might have experienced. Universities all over should care about their impact on people. By the way, the average time to complete university is now 5-7 years at ALL Canadian universities, so there is that. It's not necessarily a U of T problem because it's universal, and the reasons are varied. I could also see poor qualitative work done if they ever completed a survey. For example, students may have interrupted their studies due to work or family obligations; however, if the coursework wasn't as demanding, they could have stayed at university while handling their obligations. Therefore, whoever conducted a survey would have to be careful to find the genuine root cause of the reasons for leaving.

""Overall, fewer than half (40%) of students who started their undergraduate degree programs in 2010 graduated within four years. Nearly three-quarters (74%), however, had completed their degrees by the sixth year after first enrolment, and the average completion time was closer to four than six years. The average time to obtain an undergraduate degree was 4.49 years. Women took less time to graduate (4.41 years) than men (4.62 years).""

I went to a private American university first year and transferred back to Canada. The problem is funding. My tuition in the states was 78 000CAD a year as an international student. For domestic students it was 30 000CAD a year. For the financially strained, the university guaranteed financial help if you were admitted but obviously people who needed money needed to have much more impressive resumes. This was an Ivy League institution, for context, that received butt loads of money from donors annually that UofT probably doesn’t have. My graduating class had 2000 students.

Now for UofT. When i entered, the graduating class was like 30k students or something absurd. And it was so easy to get in. To attend you needed only a 78 avg from high school (this was 10 years ago). Our prof (Econ) straight up told us that many of us would not make it because the classes were too difficult for these students but they were admitted anyway for the money. The money doesn’t even fund undergrad programs btw, they go to grad programs bc that’s a large factor in how these schools get ranked: The amount of research produced by the school annually.",comment,29

I don't think UofT does this. Roughly [38% of UofT students graduate in 4 years](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/system/files/agenda-items/Registrarial%20Services%20in%20the%20Pandemic%20and%20Enrolment%20Update.pdf), but this is actually in line with the [Canadian average of 40%](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/191018/dq191018a-eng.htm).

I graduated 2023 and looked back on the first year content that I “struggled” through and realized that it was actually easy. I didn’t have the critical thinking or learning skills to get through the content correctly but it’s ok because I learned eventually. The best thing I took from UofT is how to use my brain. The deep satisfaction that I got in my upper years from writing a superb essay that I’d really pushed myself to create, really used all my brain power to make new original thoughts, is unparalleled. 

OP says that “profs bragged about having failing students”. Was it really bragging? I took mat137 where the prof said the same thing, but it wasn’t bragging, it was ensuring that students had reasonable expectations for themselves. They gave us options on what to do if we couldn’t keep up. They provided a substantial amount of extra tutoring support compared to other courses. This wasn’t bragging, this was just having high expectations. As they should. There were select students that breezed through this course. Why shouldn’t the superb ones get more advanced classes?  I say that as someone who had to drop the course. 

Yes this school was gruelling. I’m not sure I would do it again and Im recommending to younger friends to consider different schools. But I’m not sure the quality of education would be the same. Im not convinced that I would’ve learned to put together good thoughts without it. 

And its not abuse. Tough love, maybe, but not abuse. ",comment,16

taking on debt while also juggling learning how to run a business at this age + full-time college is very financially/emotionally stressful. i can't ask my parents for help because i'm just a burden to them in a family of six. income is unstable and after taxes we're left with what, 80, 90k? divided amongst six people, and all my siblings are younger.   
  
it's not fair that i don't qualify for non-debt financial aid beyond a few measly hundred dollars just because of ""middle class"" household income on paper. they should also consider family mental stability--bc quite frankly not everyone has that support and it can severely impede with your college experience--as well as the amount of dependents (which doesn't seem to factor in).",comment,1

I've had multiple experiences where professors would spend 2 hours teaching the course only to have it confuse the class more than anything. We then proceeded to use uploaded lectures from other universities and learned the material through those videos instead. We all landed in the B+ to A range using those videos as opposed to our own professors' classes. Best example I can give you is PHY254 classical mechanics. If you look up Stanford lectures on  YouTube for classical mechanics, you will see a set of lectures taught by Leonard Susskind. His material more or less mirrors the U of T material. What took our professor to confuse us over 2 hours, took Susskind 15 minutes to clarify and expand in depth. Honestly, my perspective is that our tuition paid for a piece of paper with the name of the university on it. The actual education was taken from other universities.

Overall, I'd argue that the majority of professors have a passion in research, which makes them valuable to the university, but they do not have a passion in teaching.",comment,5

It honestly it just sounds like they weren’t able to handle the academic rigour. No shit University of Arizona was a different experience it’s not ranked anywhere near UofT. They went to an easier school and then expected UofT to be the same. I’ve seen other people comment similar things. Schools like Carleton and Laurier (or U of Arizona) just do not compare to UofT, I have read papers that my friends got 95% on and if I were to hand them in at UofT I guarantee I would have gotten around 65%. UofT expects a higher level of work, my professors made this clear 1st year. It treats undergrads like they’re planning on continuing in academia even if they aren’t. That’s not abusing students, it’s what you sign up for when you go to UofT. 

I’ve only had two bad experiences with profs at UofT and one of them wasn’t even a UofT prof he’s was a prof from Queens who was teaching a course at UofT. Every other prof I had was passionate about their topic and passionate about teaching. Some courses I didn’t enjoy the topic but that was my personal interests not the profs sucking. The majority were very supportive and helpful and truly wanted their students to succeed. The professors that I had at UofT were not arbitrarily marking students badly, they marked students based on pretty clear expectations of a high level of academic work. Some students simply could not cut it, that’s not the schools fault. Universities aren’t supposed to lower the expectations and level of teaching to the level of the worst student otherwise the school would be useless and the diploma meaningless. Tbh I didn’t even put a huge amount of effort into school work, I went out with my friends a lot, I spent a lot of time doing hobbies and I still managed to graduate with distinction and get accepted to arguably the best school in the world for the masters I’m doing. UofT is too hard for some people, as it should be, that’s like really not the schools fault. UofT is abusing students because not all students can do well lol.

Though I did have friends from a wide range of courses and usually the complaints were either about lot of out of class were or the work being complex, very few actually complained about the profs teaching abilities.",comment,4

My point is that U of T undergraduates often don't pursue grad school here because of their grades. I've talked to many. They wished they had gone elsewhere for undergraduate school. And this is one reason there are so many non-U of T graduate students! U of T says they don't grade deflate, but they do because of the rigor of the pedagogy (that should be the name of a book or band album, haha) that students at other schools do not have to go through.

Your argument is that their GPA is not valued the same, and I disagree, yet neither of us probably has hard evidence to prove our argument. hahaha",comment,1

The top 5 universities in Canada have all increased their admin salaries and benefits. In contrast, graduate programs are shrinking and stipends keep getting clawed back while these universities beg for more funding from third parties. The goverment recently increased its financial commitment to science, so we all got a good increase that matches COL, but stipends remain to be clawed back. This then begs the question about where these funds are going? The answer remains the same: admin salaries are increasing, prof salaries stay stagnant, graduate stipends have not increased in forever, and tuition gets more and more expensive (anec. Schulich and Rotman tuitions increased but stipends remained the same).

The conclusion is thus that administration is getting the lion's share of all funds (as you pointed out that over 50% of all funds goes to salaries and benefits), while every other department has to fight for the other 50%. This problem is not exclusive to UofT, as York is currently in lockout position with its faculty union as they're trying to keep salaries the same. Thankfully our business schools get pretty good endowments, yet Rotman gets stipends clawed back while some other business schools do not.",comment,2

It's competitive for a reason. But also, your own document you linked says UBC had about the same graduation rate? I don't think McGill is the right university to compare - it's known to have higher completion rates.

Also yes, UofT can be hard to finish in 4 years. But you also forget many programs have things like Professional Experience Year which is like 16 months off school (CompSci/Engineering), many people go abroad for a term or so, many take breaks - it's not clear whether those 4 years are 4 uninterrupted, course-taking years. It's also not clear if transferring out is included. [This reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/OntarioUniversities/comments/w3z1f5/graduation_rates_at_canadian_universities/) shows how a University like Winnipeg has such a low rate, and it's not because it's necessarily hard - it's because people transfer out for one reason or another - maybe to go to a better university.
