Can i get in/do i have a chance/ what are the odds/ of getting in?,HiphenNA,1f6iv1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f6iv1d/can_i_get_indo_i_have_a_chance_what_are_the_odds/,1725208861.0,"Shut up. We don't know. We're not admissions. You making the choice to suffer through AP or IB doesn't warrant our sympathies to think you have higher odds of getting in. Neither does you being an international or domestic or a menace to society. Stop asking if program A is better than program B, people don't have the luxury nor stupidity to do 2 similar programs at 2 different universities just for the same outcome. Do what you want to do and stop acting high and mighty, thinking not using google will make you a bigger person. Most of the questions you ask are answered and outlined clearly by other students, alumni, and the university itself.

Everyone's grades are hyperinflated and odds are everyone was within the top percentile of their cohort. 

Just do the best you can do. If you get in? Congrats, get ready to suffer. If you don't? There are plenty of other and potentially better universities and colleges that can accomodate the program/field you wanna pursue. UofT isnt the deciding factor of your career and you should think long and hard about what you even want out of your degree.

We know OP sucked at university, but if you are incoming that may not be your fate. UofT is challenging, but the journey may be ultimately rewarding and ignite a drive in your life. You will likely struggle, but it feels good to still succeed in spite of the difficulty. 

You wonâ€™t believe this, and will probably dismiss it as some feel-good nonsense, but if you donâ€™t get into UofT, itâ€™s really not the end of the world. Only once you graduate like I have and experienced the real world, you realize your colleagues all took very different paths to end to the same destination.",comment,12

I remember when I was applying and waiting for my acceptances. I was super stressed out and worried myself into an academic slump. Grade 12 was my worst year academicallyâ€”still good, but I suffered terribly mentally.

I think our incoming first years could use a little grace and patience. University is a huge transition and I feel like we should do our best to be supportive, and if not, at least polite. I certainly am grateful for the upper years who supported me last year.

To any newcomers, Iâ€™m an incoming second-year student. While I canâ€™t speak for everyone, I absolutely loved my first year. I made the deanâ€™s list. It was an adjustment, but if you work diligently, advocate for yourself, and do everything to set yourself up for success, youâ€™ll be fine.",comment,18

I also think generative AI had contributed to this hyper inflation of grades, as students are becoming increasingly reliant on these technologies for assessments and many teachers â€” who are likely overworked and underpaid â€” do not have the time to assess the validity of ai submissions and take the easier approach of just giving students the higher mark.",comment,15
