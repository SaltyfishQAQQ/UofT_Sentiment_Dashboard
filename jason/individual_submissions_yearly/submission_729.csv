Or course coordinator. Many a student have been traumatized by mat135.

I did well but that was because I ran away screaming and eventually got a copy of Panchenko‚Äôs notes.",comment,17

When I had him, he never actually managed to get through his lecture slides or explain the distinction between the right and wrong answers. He gave reasons why the wrong answers could be right (or mistakenly chosen as the right answer) but he spent a lot of time explaining that instead of teaching us how we could find the right one. I only had him once so maybe he was experiencing burnout or something. Or maybe his teaching style was just incompatible with my learning style? I hold nothing against him. I‚Äôm glad that there are people who did learn from him. He seems like a nice guy.",comment,3
