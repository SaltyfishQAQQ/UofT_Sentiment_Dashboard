Quick trigger warning for SA; I was sexually assaulted on Friday of last week and I literally have not been able to do anything for the most part. Without getting into details, the fallout has been detrimental to every aspect of my life. I can't get through my assignments. I know this school takes mental health somewhat seriously. I am posting to see what I could do to ease through this. I have no idea what to do. I don't know what the protocol is for those types of situations, who I should talk to, etc. Does anyone have any idea of what I should do?",submission,204

This happened to me! reach out to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Support Center. They will have resources to  help you mentally, and may also be able to help you formally request accomodations or things if needed. I think  registrar depends college to college, but try there too! 

unortunately with some of these things, the process  tedious and exhausting, and you may still be feeling anxiety about schoolwork and deadlines and stuff. It's easy to say they're not the priority (and they're really not) but the anxiety or school slipping away from me when I was just a trying to get thru life was literally sickening on top of the actual trauma. 

Depending on your level of comfort, I would consider reaching out your professors and TAs directly  and letting them know a bit about what's going on (You don't have to get too specific and definitely don't disclose anything that makes you uncomfortable. Remember that regardless of what most academic policies and procedures say, the professors on an individual level can make exceptions and allowances for you. Also, they might understand that sometimes university procedural BS moves slow, and you are struggling to get OFFICIAL support from the school 

Again, it's intimidating and it will take courage, but if it doesn't pan out with the college or SVPSC, you could tell them something a long the lines of 

""I suffered from a traumatic event on campus/I was the victim of a crime on campus/(whatever language feels right) and am really struggling in my personal life. I have reached out to relevant university and city officials to try and navigate this event, but the procedure is moving quite slowly and my academics are suffering in the meantime. I was wondering if you could consider an extension/alternate assignment/test/pressentation/whatever you want to ask for in lieu of the midterm I am scheduled to take...""

Obviously this is super rambly but not exact, but you honestly have nothing to lose from trying. It was a while back, but it worked for me second hear.  Reported an incident, and the SVPSC couldn't do much practically and my college was just terrible about it. But every single one of my profs except for 1 either let me do something else or just dropped my midterm all together and gave me a final based on everything else. (I was super participatory and involved in class and all my assignments were in, so i also had to my advantage that they all knew me and knew I tried). 

I'm sorry this happened to you, but I promise one day your mind and your body will be yours again.",comment,28

You in no way deserved it or caused this. You deserve time to heal.  Are you able to speak to someone you feel comfortable with? And have you been to the hospital to check your physical safetly. Its not at all selfish to prioritize your mental and physical health now (or ever), and school will always be here waiting.

For school options,  it might be a good idea to contact your college registrar and talk about your options there. And email profs to let them know that 1) you are going through a traumatic event and trying to figure out your options while also trying to remain committed to your program/class. and 2) that you are speaking with your college registrar. It may be possible to get extensions, or exemptions on assignments and finals.",comment,25

This will allow you to request extra time on your assignments without having to explain why to your professor. This is really daunting but if you can get it out of the way sooner rather than later I think it will really help with your workload and mental health. Number one thing to remember is that it's not your fault and you are not alone. If you can, take a trusted friend or family member with you to the registrar's office for mutual support. If you do not have anyone to go with and would like peer support, feel free to DM me and I would be happy to come with you.",comment,18

I have been through something similar, but not SA and from experience, I contacted UofT's health and wellness, Campus Safety and the department's coordinators (Or at least the equivalent of the registrar for grad school). Contact one and they'll usually refer you to what you need, including options and support. It's what they are trained to do. 

There's also the Sexual Violence Prevention & Support Centre at Gerstein, Level -1 (the weird mish mash buiding on King's college circle): https://www.svpscentre.utoronto.ca/
They may be able to give you extra support.

Even if it may feel repetitive or hollow to say this one more time just like everyone, but I'm soo sorry this happened to you. It's truly monstrous, unfair and downright heart wrenching, and no one should have to go through this. But, you don't have to carry this on your own. It's far too heavy a burden for a single soul. Let others help you, please. Surround yourself with friends. You're the priority now, school comes after.

The most annoying part was knowing I had things to do and not being able to think of anything else bc it consumes you. you’re not alone. all these replies are right (accessiblity services,etc) but imo, the thing that helped the most was to find comfort in a family or friend who will just simply listen. if that’s not possible, maybe a young therapist. sometimes just being comforted and heard can help the most. but my advice while ur going through this is to remember 2 things 1. your brain might try and convience you you had fault in this. you did NOT. there’s absolutely no reason to wish you did anything differently or there’s nothing u could’ve done to prevent it and 2. there is light at the end of the tunnel. i know it sounds soo cheesy but trust me i thought id never be the same but im actually so much stronger now, and i rarely ever think of it. when i do, its a passing thought and i remember how much stronger i am now, no more nagging anxiety and sadness. you will get through it though it takes time you will get there. im sending you love ❤️❤️❤️",comment,1

I am so sorry to hear about what you are experiencing and I want you to know that you are strong for reaching out for help. After such an experience, it can feel overwhelming figuring out how to navigate the situation and feelings. I want you to know there are resources and people at U of T who can and want to support you. Below are a few options you can think about based on what feels most comfortable for you.

1. Disclosure: You don't need to figure this out alone, and if you want to just talk to someone without starting a formal process, you may make what is called a Disclosure. You can disclose your experience to anyone - a friend, colleague, staff member, a teaching assistant. You may also disclose to the Sexual Violence and Prevention Support Centre (SVPSC) on campus.

2. Formal Report: To initiate a formal process, such as a disciplinary process through the University, a report must be made by telling a designated member of the university. A report would include specific details of what happened, when, where, and who was involved. This could lead to internal investigations or disciplinary actions under U of T's policies, or interim measures (i.e. adjusting class/work schedules, changes in residence arrangements). 

3. Reporting to the Police: You also have the option to file a report with Campus Safety or your local police station. In Canada, you can file a police report for SA at any time. There is no statute of limitations. This means you can report whenever you feel ready. Whether it is days, months, or years later. If you make a report to Campus Safety, the SVPSC would be notified as well, so that you may access additional support. 

  
Here are some additional resources that can support your mental health and well-being during this time:

* **Good2Talk** (Confidential mental health support for post-secondary students): 1-866-925-5454 or text GOOD2TALKON to 686868.
* **MySSP (Student Support Program)**: 24/7 counseling support via phone or chat. Download the app or call 1-844-451-9700.
* **UofT Health & Wellness Centre**: Counseling and medical services tailored for students.
   * Website: [Health & Wellness Services](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/health-wellness/)
   * Phone: 416-978-8030
* Academic Accommodations: You can request accommodations through the SVPSC or the Accessibility Services office to manage deadlines, assignments, or exams. 
   * Contact: [Accessibility Services](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/department/accessibility-services/) | Phone: 416-978-8060

Lastly, I want to say that whatever path you do choose, know that you have the right and decision to choose how you want to proceed, and there are people who care about you and want to help. It is absolutely okay to take things one step at a time, and prioritize your own well being and lots of self care. Sending you strength and support.
