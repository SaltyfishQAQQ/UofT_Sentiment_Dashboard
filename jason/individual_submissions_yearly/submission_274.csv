I think when a kid turns 18 years old, they are old enough to vote which means that they are old enough to make decisions regarding their political beliefs. Also, political propaganda doesn't only affect young people like university students, it affects everybody. If people keep treating university students as ""vulnerable"", they are never going to grow up. We're seeing such shit with Gen Z where they have to bring their mommy and daddy to their job interview, and they have separation anxiety. People need to stop babying those who ain't babies anymore.",comment,2
