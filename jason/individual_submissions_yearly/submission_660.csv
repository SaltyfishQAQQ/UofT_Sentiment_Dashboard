It greatly depends on where you're from of course, but Toronto is pretty good in terms of safety I would say. The worst you'll come across is perhaps some weird people once in a while. 

That aside I actually love night classes for the vibes. I can sleep in, and the vibe of the moments after class is just priceless. You can sometimes grab a drink with classmates after class too.",comment,17
