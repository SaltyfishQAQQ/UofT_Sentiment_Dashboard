Undergrad, graduating, and alumni too :)",woodhorse2,1d5fp9g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d5fp9g/anyone_want_to_be_friends_undergrad_graduating/,1717219290.0,"Iâ€™m graduating at the end of June and have really only had one solid university friend group here as a commuter (and it fell apart). Now that Iâ€™ve moved downtown toronto, does anyone wanna be friends? all years are welcome!! 4th years esp to celebrate upcoming convocation? Iâ€™m super into kdramas, music, sci-fi and finding new food, drinks, and restaurants to go to downtown! :) with the warm weather coming up, I think itâ€™d be fun to make some new friends. lmk!

edit: if youâ€™re comfortable, drop ya instas! otherwise you can message me. I wanna create a groupchat where we can chill, talk, and plan hangouts downtown!!! <3",submission,54
