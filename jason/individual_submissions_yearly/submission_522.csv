if you're broke and you can't afford toilet paper, i have a few options for you

- look into food banks
- apply for emergency grants at your college registrar 
- apparently a bidet is a good investment?",comment,27

It's mostly about food but food banks in general have toilet paper and other supplies like feminine hygiene products. If not, they have a budget to buy some for you. there are other [food banks in Toronto](https://www.torontocentralhealthline.ca/listservices.aspx?id=10572), many mention toilet paper supplies.

I think it's better than being seen as stealing. Not sure if you'll be broke all term, if so, I think eventually someone will notice. Plus public washroom toilet paper is not the same as store bought, it will be obvious at some point. Could affect your academic reputation.

Might be worth talking to the registrar's office for ideas on more [financial aid](https://future.utoronto.ca/finances/financial-aid/). Or your parents, if you still have a connection with them. I'm sure they would give you some cash for toilet paper. No doubt complain about residence costs not including toilet paper, but that's not your fault, eh!",comment,16

Unlike other food banks in Toronto where people line up, UTSU says it's done by appointment, Fridays between 11 and 3. 

It's for any student in need, they mention maintaining privacy and confidentiality. If you're hungry and down on your luck without enough $ to feed yourself, I would not hesitate to get their help. 

You can also go to other food banks in Toronto. Some do have restrictions on how often you can visit and if you live in the area (postal codes). I think the Daily Bread limits visits to 3x a month. There's a good one on College called Fort York Food Bank (FYFB), it has fresh produce. You line up then it's like a grocery store where you pick and choose. You may have to show ID that you live in the area. 

With the cost of living going up, food banks are however running out of food with the high demand. I've heard one called St. James where it's necessary to call 211 to get a number to go there. 

One food bank in Brampton last year decided to ban international students ([CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/no-international-students-as-need-grows-brampton-food-bank-turning-some-away-1.7024375)). I think it didn't help about the youtube videos where students from India were boasting about getting free food. Some even resell the food on fb.

[International students are ABUSING food banks and BRAGGING about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BISFOw5TfUw)

Food banks are meant for those who struggle with buying food. Technically, international students are supposed to come here with enough funds to support their education and living expenses. But life gets expense for some or an unexpected expense. But I think the youtube ones were abusing Canada's generosity to be able to spend $ on other things.
