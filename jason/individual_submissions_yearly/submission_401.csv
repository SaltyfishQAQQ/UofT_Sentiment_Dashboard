For context I've never been a person who eats much - I'm 110 pounds and 170 cm - and it really doesn't take a lot for me to feel full. However the meals at the dining hall just aren't enough, even though I'm going over my daily food budget.

It's another way to try and hide away higher costs (inflation). They just shrink the portion sizes or quality so that the price looks roughly similar to the past (but we know it ain't lol). Man, I glad I had a meal plan 20+ years ago when we had a good economy. Being an undergrad now must be super rough (not the tuition - didn't change too much, but definitely the cost of living in general). I remember back in the day, rent was only 3-figures a month. It was like $400/month in Waterloo. Most of the decay was in the past decade though. Tuition surprisingly didn't go up AS much.

Takes a month to go through withdrawals. In the meantime, you'll crave more food. Here's the recommendation for health: 

""Men should consume no more than 9 teaspoons (36 grams or 150 calories) of added sugar per day. Women should consume no more than 6 teaspoons (25 grams or 100 calories) per day""

To give you an idea, one 12oz can of Coke is 39 grams of sugar. 

If you think it's about calories, then getting some healthy high calorie snacks will help. Some are hypoglycemic where they need to eat every 3 hrs too. Healthy is nuts, protein bars, dried fruit. Sugar sure helps the brain think and the body with more energy, but not so good long term! 

Any grocery store will have these. Nearby ones are Whole Foods, Loblaws, Independent City Market, Metro or T&T. I find WFs has the best selection, then Loblaws - both similar priced as the other stores. I order from [nuts.com](http://nuts.com), fresher and better deals than here.",comment,1
