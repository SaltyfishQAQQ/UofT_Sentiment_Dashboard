But very few of these connections turn to friendships. 


What faculty are you? You can also dm me. ",comment,10

Also, participate in events organized by SGS; they have various activities that aren't department specific. [https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/current-students/](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/current-students/) This looks super-useful, for example [https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/resources-supports/gcac/](https://www.sgs.utoronto.ca/resources-supports/gcac/)

And, of course, you can look into signing up to be a Chief Presiding Officer come final exam time.  Those are usually GS from around the UofT.  I don't know when the ads would post but they should be Unit 1 positions...",comment,7

Not sure if those are still happening. That said, people tended to come in groups of their own department and stick to them. There was also a pub but that's gone now as well.

If your cube is in an isolated location, the only other places I met new grad students from different faculties were as  friends of friends (or collaborators) or through random chance on dating apps. Reddit can also be a good place to meet people.",comment,1
