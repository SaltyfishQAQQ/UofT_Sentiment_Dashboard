I had 6 classes and then I dropped it down to four so my work load isn‚Äôt as bad but I feel trapped here. I really thought I‚Äôd like it here but one thing I can‚Äôt deal with is the lack of social life I have here. I have friends that‚Äôs not the issue but I‚Äôve visited a couple other universities that my friends go to and it just makes me start to rethink coming here. I‚Äôve been looking at other universities but I feel like if I give up I‚Äôm a failure and especially dropping out of uoft. Since I was very little I‚Äôve held this school to such a high standard and I feel like if I do transfer then I‚Äôm limiting my future self. Do jobs really care about what university you go to for an undergraduate degree? I‚Äôm stuck, I really do want to go to school here but I don‚Äôt think I can live like this with no social life whatsoever. Some advice would be much appreciated üôè",submission,19

Any demanding program will mean less of a social life. Besides, more of a city to explore here than smaller university towns. 

Starting at any university away from home means more effort to make friends (clubs, sports, for example). It's not black and white forever, eventually you'll make some connections. You're looking at this with a lens of all or nothing. There is hope for change. 

Jobs really do care about the university - some are higher ranked than others. Will you get a job at a lesser known one, for sure. Will you have more opportunities to choose from with UofT, absolutely including ones in the US. 

It's a big change with first year - are you sure you are not homesick? Change takes time to adapt to. If you like your program, I would stick it out to 2nd year at least. You can always transfer credits to switch universities if you're still unhappy and UofT resources can't help. ([MH UofT resources](https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/), helps to talk to someone).

My life at uoft was terrible. I hated every single day of it and felt trapped. It was nothing like i thought it would be. Got super depressed and had to work through that. The last two years things got better as I found more friends. But all and all my university experience is something I don‚Äôt wish to repeat. But I tell you this I‚Äôm pretty sure the university brand is what landed good interviews and jobs for me. I was able to get jobs when my friends from other universities were struggling.

But things got better over time, it was stressful but I didn't feel like I needed to give up later on.

Making an almost entirely new set of friends while dealing with the stress of university can be very hard for people, and there's definitely no reason to feel like you are lagging behind.

Most jobs don't really care about what major you did. The undergrad degree might mean something but not that much. Internships, relevant experience, and specific employable skills are usually the most important. Besides, business, engineering, and a few other majors, most will not help you get a job in any direct and specific way.",comment,2

It sounds like it's about adapting to change and leaving old friends behind since they've left for other universities.

First year can be difficult anywhere. Even though it's the same curriculum at high schools in Ontario, some are not as demanding. First year tends to be a leveling so everyone has the same foundation going forward. It was ambitious to take 6, smart to recognize and reduce to succeed.

You're not a failure to consider changing but I think you will be faced with similar challenges both education wise and making friends. Better to give this your best, it's only been a month so far. Life will get better.

Part of this adaption is learning to manage time versus the predictability of high school. Part of this adaption is learning how to make friends by putting yourself out there (clubs, activities) versus running into them at high school classes or living next door in your neighbourhood.

I think if you make a plan, you will succeed and get comfortable at UofT. This plan would be joining groups with similar hobbies, going to the gym or joining a sport, or just talking a walk some days saying hi to strangers.

You can join clubs at any university except the program restricted ones although UofT has the most. There are outside clubs on [meetup.com](http://meetup.com) There are outside sports at JAM or joining a gym, say to learn krav maga or muay thai. Treat it like an assignment with steps only with a goal of making friends.

This will help you get unstuck. It's a process like any other and will give you those soft life skills to succeed in a future career (i.e. networking, finding resources). Soft skills will help with a better work/life balance. University is about more than the education.

I have hired a few new grads - a challenging university means they can think out of the box to problem solve, admit mistakes and adapt, and make connections to get answers. You're not alone in first year with making new friends - you'll get there with a plan. Small steps will add up to big ones where you'll make those connections. In the meantime, I'd work on self-improvement like exercise!",comment,6
