I have a 1.5 hr commute just to make it to Toronto. I believe I am also unable to make any timetable change requests since it's a first year eng program. Any advice?,submission,49

It'll be rough in the beginning but use the first few weeks to figure out which classes you can afford to skip. Some tutorials are just open work sessions where you can ask the TA questions, so if there are no marks then you can skip those. Maybe some lectures are recorded, so you can watch them on your own time. Maybe you covered most of the topics in MAT186 in high school so you don't have to go to the lectures. Maybe your instructor sucks so you learn better with the textbook.

It's not like high school where you have to attend everything. Evaluate for yourself whether a class is worth attending.

I remember not being able to wake up for my APS111 9am lectures so I did the participation stuff on my phone in my bed. I skipped pretty much all MAT186 lectures because I learned it in high school and the instructor sucked. The tutorials (I think they were graded) helped me keep pace with the class. But some classes, like MAT188 and CIV100, were must-attends for me. The material was new and I learned better in lecture than by myself. I basically skipped all of APS110 because I learned the material in high school.

YMMV",comment,23

The first week might be tiring but you WILL get used to it and get in routine. Use the time on the train or bus wisely, either studying or sleeping, because that’s how people not commuting are using those same hours. 

Don’t skip your 9 AM classes, I guarantee that’s not a habit that will lead to success. It looks like you have Tuesday to sleep in and get some work done from home, so enjoy that and make the most of it!

Enjoy first year engineering!",comment,6

Do readings during your commute, there pre class problems with quizzes for 186 and 188 every week. You can adjust your timetable but then you would be with different cohorts and it will be difficult to make friends/be with the same people. Atleast skip one day of school every week, Tuesdays for you! Also, look up diff lecture sections online and go to maybe earlier mat188 section. Skip only 110,186. 111 has videos online you can watch if you and your team choose to skip together. Go to the library after class and try to avoid rush hour. Much better to go home after finishing all your work. I would always go to robarts and leave at 10 pm!",comment,3

It sucked, but I survived. You do eventually get used to it. Some people are able to do work (review lecture notes, do readings, homework etc) on the subway, but I wasn't one of those people - try to be, though, if possible.

I commuted about 1.5hr each way for first year engineering and my last train departed at 9am - so the latest I could arrive on campus was 10am which made those morning gaps very annoying since I couldn’t even sleep in. 

Overall, didn’t have an issue, the only concern for you is Tuesday. I would skip that day and attend another professors lecture, if possible — but if your situation is different and you can commute anytime you want then I would attend Tuesdays lecture, stay for a couple hours after at a library to finish any work and make the commute worthwhile - then head home. 

You may be concerned why they make Tuesdays with those large gaps. Tuesday is when all your exams/midterms will occur, so they leave it open for every engineering student since all 1300 students write exams at the same time. My Tuesday in first year was similar cept I had one more 5-6pm at the very end. Basically every first year has a similar Tuesday and schedule as you. 

After a while, you will get into the hang of handling the course load and will enjoy the breaks as they are perfect for finishing the insane amount of minor tasks (quizzes before lectures, Webwork assignments, online homework/readings, tutorial worksheets, written homework etc,.). These tasks can take anywhere from 10-20mins (prelecture quizzes) to an hour or two (webworks) to much longer (written homework/projects). So having some downtime to work on it between classes will help. 

Like another commenter said, you’re just as doomed as the other 1,300 students in first year engineering. The schedules are near identical, same courses/load, same assignments, same exams.",comment,1
