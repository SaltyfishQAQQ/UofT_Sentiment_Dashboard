While I’ve seen plenty of advice for undergrads, I haven’t come across much for grad students.   
  
what are the best things to do early in grad school to make the most of it? Using campus resources, networking opportunities, managing finances etc. 

Thanks! ",submission,43

It is hands down the best tool on the planet. That said, get super familiar with your citation style of choice because it isn’t always accurate and you’ll need a good grasp on it when you’re grading undergrads. 

Look into the tri council research grant that is connected to your specialty (SSHRC, NSERC, CHIR I think?) and prepare to apply for CGS-m if you’re going into a research masters and want that sweet second year funding. UofT students in research masters are near guaranteed this funding so long as they write a good proposal, so it’s 100% worth the mental strain. 

Also some maybe more pessimistic advice: try to embrace the magic and the cool parts of grad school, but also be prepared to see a lot of the reality of a career in academia. Don’t rely on your profs for validation or you’ll end up with Stockholm syndrome. I got more support and guidance from the PhD students I TA for than I’ve ever received from my tenured professors. Your peers are your number one support system, not your teachers. Try to stick together, without them it really sucks. 

If you have the chance, take electives outside of your department in a field you’re interested in. Try to expand your horizons a little, it’s a lot harder than in undergrad but so rewarding. 

Set aside one day a week (at least) to do no school work if possible. You can get swallowed up by the grind and get severe burnout if you aren’t careful. Keeping one day sacred for bed rotting, going to the gym, meal prep, or doing something you love saves your sanity in the busy times.

Speaking as a super high achieving student in undergrad who scoffed when people told me that getting a masters is brutal, I should’ve listened. You are going to have to fight a ton of negative self talk to survive. On the other hand, my writing has improved tenfold, and I’ve learned to value myself beyond my academic ability, which has been a game changer. 

The best advice I got on my first day was to remember that (at least in my field) it isn’t brain surgery, nobody dies if we make a mistake, or miss a class, or give up. It’s just school, and we are bigger than school. Good luck!",comment,62

I'm not saying they won't be, but you never really now. Don't lower your guard down and don't let them get under your skin. Be assertive in protecting your boundaries. Record all your meetings with administration (it's legal in Ontario).

Don't expect your supervisor have your back. Again, they may well do, but it's not guaranteed. They and other folk can be smiling and sweet and not give any shit about you or actually hurt you. 

Take advantage of your medical insurance. It has therapy, massage, drug coverage etc. It's pretty decent.

There're a lot of different sports to try at the sport centers and they offer instructed trainings at affordable price.

If you need extra funding, monitor regularly cupe posting website, you can apply for TAships outside your department too. 

File your tax return - we make so little that the govt pays you back \~300 CAD.",comment,3
