"As promised, I strolled through Kings College and this is what it looked like",mellytomies,1cyyqi6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1cyyqi6,1716485991.0,"Just want to start by saying that I don‚Äôt remotely belong to either cultural group. I was born in Toronto and have had the privilege of a life without civil war. My only stake in this situation is that I was a student during the fall/winter semester when the conflict started hitting headlines and I‚Äôll be graduating in June. I‚Äôll be observing the people who will be protesting on convocation day alongside my peers, who have all been pretty quiet about this topic. This post is for the people who are curious to know what their graduation ceremony is going to look like if its at the convocation hall next week.

The impression I got from this encampment was this: it was quiet, there wasnt anybody blocking doors to the adjacent buildings, and there wasnt really an air of chaos that has been exaggerated on insta. Its peaceful. It was just asian tourists visiting the campus for their kids and people going to and from class. There is an entrance to the encampment thats being guarded by a handful of people, but not much human activity. Of the 6 whole protestors I saw, it wasnt exactly a mixed group, but my sample size is too low to really confirm anything. No they were not wearing masks or trying to conceal their identity. Unfortunately it smells like weed and other things you could guess would come from an encampment, but thats to be expected. In contrast, there was a lot of construction going on and contractors working all around the encampment. I feel a little bad. That whole stretch of park has no shade so I wager its hot as hell in there.

So no, Kings College isnt a warzone, and you can go about convocation without feeling unsafe. There are a number of places where you can take decent pictures without getting tents in the background. Nobody is blocking doors and going after eachother.

‚Äî

One person on this reddit said that uoft put the fence up to deliberately stop the anticipation of a protest, but after visiting today I think that‚Äôs just bs. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I counted at least 3 other sites that were fenced off for construction and landscaping all around the circle. Plus, the work that is being prepared for the circle was no different from the construction on Robarts and Woodsworth. Its ironic that this same fence is now being used as a barrier preventing contractors, or really anybody, from entering the park. I did not try to enter this checkpoint thing, and I‚Äôm aware that other journalists have attempted to do this with varying results.

I finally formed an opinion on this. I think it‚Äôs great that people are practicing their freedom of expression. You should be allowed to advocate for vulnerable groups without getting shot by cops. While I think the war/crimes against humanity is awful, I actually don‚Äôt really support the encampment and their demands. Literally every facet of our country has had a direct and indirect involvement in supporting warfare beyond our borders. So even if they were to succeed in getting UofT to stop being involved with companies like Hebrew University of Jerusalem(??), or the Daughters for Life Foundation (?????) I honestly dont believe the unrelenting warfare in the middle east-east asia will ever really end. Children will still die at the same rate, relief workers will still die, genocides are still going to be funded by Canadian corpos, families will still face tragedy, and the isms will continue onward because nobody can agree on how the borders should be redrawn. 

A brief crash course on the history of Israel in my undergrad still feels true to me. I know that is my oblivious privilege talking, but this is all I see before me. There are so many problems in the world and I only have the energy for the ones happening here on this side of the globe. The fentanyl epidemic, the children who make up the majority of clients in Canadian foodbanks, the unaffordability of life as we know it, and the isolated elderly populace here in the GTA have my full attention. 

I‚Äôm at peace with the protest and I wish the protesters well. If they get UofT to yield to their demands, that is awesome and I‚Äôll applaud their efforts. I hope other people find their peace with this too.

Sorry I typed this on my phone lol",submission,919

I get it that there is much that we can fix around here, but it‚Äôs such a weird statement to make. Are _you_ protesting to fix all these issues? Telling other people that what they are protesting is ‚Äúnot the right thing to protest‚Äù from your armchair is easy. Clearly, the protestors think stopping the murder of children and unarmed civilians to be pressing, and they don‚Äôt want our university involved in fuelling this atrocity.",comment,61

This is not a political issue, this is a human rights issue. Palestinians are being killed every day, and they have been for a very long time now. Even if some didn‚Äôt know about the subject until last year WHO CARES? At least they know now. It doesn‚Äôt take much to understand that innocent civilians being killed is wrong. Is that simple.

That alone might be a good enough reason to pressure israeli public. I'm rather more concerned with ""genocide"" being thrown around like a buzzword without complete proof and due process. Footage of a building getting blown up after obvious roof knocking is not a war crime, some kids being collateral damage in an air strike is not genocide. In a war truth is scarce and propaganda is rampant, yet somehow people are already making their mind up.

At the time when SA implemented what it called Apartheid it wasn‚Äôt explicitly a bad word - it was part of their law, and most countries considered it their internal matter and continued to support them, especially during the Cold War when SA was considered a prime anticommunist ally in Africa. Why do you think it took protests and encampments to get everyone to divest from SA? Even at the time there were big debates and a ton of people ready to justify it or look the other way for their own reasons, including the US and the UK. Apartheid had been in place officially since the ‚Äò40s, calls for divestment started in the ‚Äò60s, but actual divestment only took place in the ‚Äò80s. Why do you think it took 4 decades, when people knew exactly what it Apartheid meant?


It‚Äôs exactly the same scenario with Israel - the west is happy to look the other way for their own strategic reasons while supplying them massive amounts of armaments, not to mention the kind of lobbying power Israel has SA could only have ever dreamed of.",comment,3

Personally I don't see the real point of disrupting grad since it really only punishes the students - uoft already has our money, I don't think they really care that much about the graduation experience of soon to be alumni (they haven't cared much about our cohort throughout this entire uni experience given how poorly COVID was handled).

Hamas leaves office, conflict over. Palestinian people eject Hamas from office, conflict over. I don‚Äôt think anyone actually believes the conflict will end with Hamas in power. Call for that instead of divestment.

Don‚Äôt see many return the hostage signs or out with Hamas signs. War would be over if they returned them (or the remains at this point). Why not shit on Egypt too since they just got caught essentially prolonging the war.

What‚Äôs Israel supposed to do when the main goal and constitution of Hamas is to wipe out all Jews and the Palestinian government maintains a Martyr fund? The war is wrong, but how much shelling and insurgencies does Israel have to take to make the war just in your opinion? There‚Äôs been what, thousands if not tens of thousands of shells and missiles launched at Israel prior to this? You can see the list on Wikipedia and most sources readily. Either the war is just or unjust for both sides. You don‚Äôt get to cherry-pick either side. I‚Äôm sure these students would have a different opinion if they lived in either territory.

Man is a wolf to man. Both sides are just in their wars (though I think the whole wipe out Jews thing is not right), but the Jewish people fought a war to establish their state and won. This justifies the Palestinians to do the same, they have every right to try to establish a state the same with Israel did. That being said, part of being a responsible government is being prepared. Hamas was elected and enjoys popular support. Hamas has wanted war for a long time and has gotten it. Unfortunately as war goes, the sins of the father are metered on the sons. Plenty call for the death of Israel (replace Israel with any conflict) but aren‚Äôt too keen when it‚Äôs their time to fight.

People rush to ‚Äúthink of the children!‚Äù But where was that sentiment when random shellings have been going on, targeted at civilians, for decades. Heck, even during the larger fights (think arab Israeli war, Yom Kippur) the arabs focused on civilian targets, not military. This war is a culmination of decades of history, not just October 7th. Now it seems to be a problem because an actual war has broken out instead of consistent low level skirmishes and attacks. I think that reflects poorly on the students protesting. They didn‚Äôt really seem to care until now, which is problematic.",comment,-3

There are plenty of Israeli Arabs that live under Israeli civil law. However - 

Israeli civil laws don't apply in the West Bank. If they did, the Palestinian Authority wouldn't have any sort of power, and west bank would be directly controlled like Tel Aviv.

So the Palestinian authority has some amount of discretion on what laws to pass ext. However, Israel does still extent it's military law to the west bank.

Do you realize that there are checkpoints EVERYWHERE IN ISRAEL FOR ALL RESIDENTS AND VISITORS WHETHER they are Arab or Jewish or adult or child? It is simply a part of life there. The checkpoints are in place to prevent people from bringing weapons into hospitals, malls, bus stations, etc. the checkpoints exist because they are simply trying to protect themselves. They are checking every single human- Women have to open their purses and put them through a conveyer, everybody has to walk through metal detectors... It's really horrible that they have to do this, but when you've suffered so many terrorist attacks, what are you supposed to do? And there are more checkpoints in East Jerusalem and Hebron because there is more of a mix of Arabs and Jews living and working in those areas, and well, people are paranoid. The Army presence is palpable everywhere, though, it's just become their way of life.

And BTW - Are you aware that before October 7th, there were over 500,000 Palestinians that were coming from Gaza and the West Bank every day to work in Israel? Bankers, pharmacists, doctors? So again, a super easy checkpoint. 

IMO This war was never to serve the Palestinian populace, it was to vilify the Israelis, and to inspire rife anti semitism throughout the world, for the ulterior motive of destroying the Jewish people.

‚ÄúStanding Together recognizes that it will have members ‚Äì generally Jews ‚Äì who are Zionist, and others ‚Äì generally Arabs ‚Äì who are not.

(Sally Abed is one of their elected leadership, she is Palestinian and socialist). 


Similarly, the most radical peace camp org is [combatants for peace](https://cfpeace.org) they are as Palestinian as they are Israeli, and they follow along the same mostly trend as standing together, in fact the Israeli half of the group that started them was an explicitly Zionist conscious objector group who refused to serve in the occupation, oppression of Palestinians.

Are you going to sanction the mining companies whose metals are sold to manufacturers that make weapons? If they weren‚Äôt mining they wouldn‚Äôt have metal to sell that might end up in Israel, after all.
