Like im applying to jobs that need a 3.7 gpa regardless of what school you go to .. if i go to the university of alberta vs U of t i still need that 3.7 keep in mind that 3.7 is harder to get at U of t. Why don't employers actually understand that universities aren't symmetrical and cant impose a flat gpa expectation when there are universities who just simply grade harder and curve less.  By doing this companies and firms are legitmately removing talented people from the work force and reducing talent density in their office.. i honestly don't understand.",submission,94

Most departments enforce low averages across their classes, and professors may even get in trouble if the class or midterm average is too high. Some departments have lower averages than others, such a Statistics and Economics. However, a lot of companies are aware that the university has higher standards than other institutions in Canada, and take that into consideration when hiring. I would say that, depending on the company and division  the fact that the student graduated from University of Toronto supersedes a decent (3.2-3.4) or even low average (less than 3.1). For investment banking, and even capital markets, the GPA requirements are strict, but I have heard of candidates who got internships and full time positions with GPAs in the 3.5-3.6 range. ",comment,3

With most internships and entry level positions your GPA is almost always a stand in for the job experience you don't have since the last four years of your life has been dedicated to earning a degree.

I'd wager that if you're seeing GPA requirements like that for internships, it's because the job market for that profession is becoming over-saturated.  Setting a high GPA requirement just gives employers another metric upon which they can discriminate between candidates, all else being equal.

And just as employers are free to set their hiring metrics as they see fit, you are also free to attend whichever university you see fit.  Knowing that UofT grades harder than other institutions, you may want to consider transferring to one of those schools where it is easier to achieve and maintain that level of GPA.

You make sense but IB recruitment (and most others with high gpa preferences) are far from digitized.


You will definitely be looked at with a 3.5/3.6 GPA if you nail the other parts of the process.",comment,2

If an applicant doesn’t have the minimum it doesn’t matter because it just means they didn’t grind enough. IB just wants grinders, so you’ve gotta suck it up. 

Try to get an internship in corporate banking or any of the capital markets groups first, they have lower requirements. Then build up connections for the IB internship since they share the same division. This is also a good idea because deal flow is abysmal rn so you’re probably competing with dudes who are demons.",comment,4

-As soon as I was in a role where hiring was involved, I found that the best filter was putting applicants through an assessment that generally replicates job conditions to test the passive skills of their education like analysis, critical thinking, reading, writing and data handling. This allowed me to vet who actually gained work relevant abilities from their education. I was noticing that my early assumptions about credentials were incorrect and meaningless since a lot of on paper top students (based on awards and such) were often the worst employees since they were well tooled for school and had little else to offer skills wise.

-Exactly my point. As an adjunct, CI, or TA, I heard a laundry list of student complaints about grades and never was one of them 'Hey this will impact my GPA for job applications'.",comment,1
