First week and I'm already mentally spiralling (4th year),deleted,1fcdul6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fcdul6/first_week_and_im_already_mentally_spiralling_4th/,1725845402.0,"I''m only just realizing that my ADHD is the reason I have such a hard time with memory. One of my profs moved so fast and went ""this is all review for you, right?"" I was so overwhelmed. I don't have the option of taking an extra year, but I also no longer see a future career for myself (Anthropology). Everyone wants to do grad school, but I don't see any path open to me because I can't absorb stuff quickly enough. I'm terrified for the discussions. Last year I got good grades, but now I feel so dumb and embarrassed over not being able to recall things fast enough.

I know usually everyone feels bad after the first week, but I feel particularly ashamed being in my last year and struggling more than ever before. If anyone has any advice or hopeful words to offer it'd be so appreciated",submission,41

""Feel so dumb and embarrassed"" is just your mental reactions that everyone can get, don't let these negative reactions pull you down. Try to review past notes - if you got good grades before you can get them back quickly. Also remember to take a break when needed (preferably involving physical movement) so you can concentrate better after.",comment,8
