It‚Äôs kind of a lot compared to high school to be honest, so you might get exhausted ESPECIALLY mondays, but there‚Äôs no way around it and most of your peers will be in the same boat.

I don‚Äôt know if this is still the case, but labs that end in ‚Äú1‚Äù are week one, and ‚Äú2‚Äù are week two (for courses that have labs every two weeks.

it might also make a difference whether you‚Äôre commuting or living on res. for a long commute, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this because you would also have to factor in the hours you would lose travelling to and from campus.
