Professionalism of Prof Ignacio Uriarte Tuero and MAT337 team,mrjohnyan,1cu9i8t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cu9i8t/professionalism_of_prof_ignacio_uriarte_tuero_and/,1715963053.0,"I am writing to express my extreme disappointment and anger at the situation with the whole course and the actions of the MAT337 team. Your actions have caused great harm and harm to all who participated in 2022 Fall MAT337 and hurt our community.

Earlier, there was some controversy surrounding the whole course. First, the course itself was extremely unreasonable. Prof. Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero gave us about 30 to 60 practice problems for each chapter, and he would pick some of his test problems from those practice problems. Although these problems are not mandatory, they are actually not designed for practicing the material taught in lectures or help us better understand the topics. The difficulty of many of these problems is way above problems given in previous years, which means that if we don’t complete them before the tests, we would not have the time and ability to solve them during the tests. We had four HW assignments throughout the semester and each of them shares 10% of overall grade. However, Prof. Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero assigns 10+ questions on each HW assignment but only marks 3 of them super harshly and never provide any solutions. Around midterm, most students dropped class and the class size dropped from 80+ to 40+. Relatively strong students stayed and so the averages are highly biased, and after the class ended, the class average was C-. As mentioned before, assessment format and difficulty are overall on another level. Inthe meantime, the assessments in the course have been poorly designed. For the sole midterm test throughout the semester, we only had 50 minutes to finish the exam but it shares 30% of overall grade.

Besides that, what disappointed me the most was the way of MAT337 and Prof. Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero's attitude towards this matter. Judging by his ""response"", all responsibility is on the student and the student should not take all responsibility for the situation. I, or any other member of the U of T community, would agree that the reply was written in an insulting and condescending tone that was highly unprofessional and childish, and buried their heads in the sand as their anger mounted. I question the responsibility and professionalism of the MAT337 team and Prof. Ignacio Uriarte-Tuero. No one deserves to be treated like this.",submission,44

For comparison, we had about 15-20 questions each week which is less than your 30-60 for a chapter I guess? And we had some of these randomly picked for quizzes but best 3/5 quizzes so also quite generous. And half the exam questions also picked from homeworks. 

The 50 minutes midterm for an abstract math course is unreasonable tbh. We had a 2 hour midterm. 

And our final score did have a generous curve. My very heuristic guess would be we averaged C to C+ before the curve and will probably average in the Bs after the curve.

Overall yeah if you only have 40 people left in class, for a course that's math major and not math specialist, having a C- course average is criminal. 

Let this be a lesson that it's better to drop courses like these and move on rather than try to struggle with them. UofT doesn't care.",comment,3

You're essentially left in a position where you have to have memorized dozens of, sometimes quite lengthy and difficult, proof-based problems entirely to have a chance at completing the test in the allotted time. The test thus come down almost to chance since a small number of problems are selected from the massive pool provided, so if you are super confident in even 90% of the homework questions provided, there is a chance that the 10% you aren't as confident in are tested and as a result you will be left in a position where it is quite literally impossible to finish all questions.

That's the most upsetting part. You aren't tested on your understanding of the material, but rather your ability to memorize a bunch of random solutions.",comment,10
