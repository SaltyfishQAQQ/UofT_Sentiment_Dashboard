It really doesn‚Äôt feel like an academic thing or a program thing. More like people are in personal competition with everyone else. You‚Äôll be walking around campus and people don‚Äôt smile at each other or even really acknowledge each other, it‚Äôs kind of just an empty and almost rude (??) glare. I‚Äôve spoken with friends and classmates about this and they all feel the same. Last week I even had a group of girls (that I have never met) sit behind me and talk about something I had posted on instagram. Does anyone else feel this way? ",submission,213

I'm a guy and commuting student so I'm admittedly less in-tune with the UTSG campus vibe.

That said, if you're a final year student, there might be an underlying competition for the graduate programs since I heard those can be pretty tough. 

As for the girls who were talking about you. They might be just saying something else that you could have misinterpreted. But, to be on the safe side, I recommend setting your Instagram to private so only people who follow you can view your posts.",comment,37

On residence people definitely see the reality of eachothers lives more and it must bring people close together. I‚Äôm not sure what your reasons are for commuting, but I‚Äôd be commuting kind of nm what so this might be less of a UofT issue and more of a our position in the university social network issue. That and also the fact that lots of people here can‚Äôt see past their egos for a genuine connection. A lot of people will be nice to you if you are nice to them, but few people are actually warm and want to be real friends. It‚Äôs more of an exchange of what people know and who does what, and often people are feeling real small and are more interested in comparing themselves to you rather than knowing you. That‚Äôs a large basis of the interaction that goes down here. It‚Äôs sad, and I think it happens at a lot more places than UofT. It‚Äôs really hard to rise above as well, especially when everyone including yourself is somewhat consumed over it. It makes us feel not good enough and never good enough and keeps us perpetually moving on a quest to change what we never really can. Always striving for better and trying to fill ourselves with validation from those around us. When really we need to look within, and drop all of these honestly abstract measurements of ourselves. Only operate on your own accord. Things will be fine, your pain will cease.",comment,4

It‚Äôs totally reasonable‚Äî I recognize that a bunch of students are international and are paying a fortune for their tuition. It‚Äôs just been hard for me to relate to anyone there so far because of that. Personally, I think it‚Äôs equally important to have a fulfilling life outside of school/career. I value relationships and having balance in my life, but the people I have talked to are primarily concerned with academics and our conversations don‚Äôt really go beyond that. I‚Äôve gotten along much better with my coworkers from other universities and found that their mindsets were more similar to my own. I hate the toxic competitive environment at UofT. To be fair though, the masters students I‚Äôve encountered at my ROP are much easier to get along with and seem more well-rounded. Maybe it‚Äôs just an undergraduate thing. Idk. It is what it is. I‚Äôm also sure that there are many undergraduates who aren‚Äôt like what I described above, I‚Äôm just speaking from my limited personal experience",comment,1

It makes up a toxic work culture because the academic side is the only side people really show, and that plays on a lot of people‚Äôs insecurities surrounding their life choices and careers. It honestly makes you feel a little weird for having a life outside of school sometimes haha. I‚Äôd agree though that our perspectives on this are for sure limited, we‚Äôre only talking about what we‚Äôve seen.",comment,1
