"IMM250 changed from online to in person exam, announced on the day of enrolment deadline",Instantnoodlesssss,1finkt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1finkt5/imm250_changed_from_online_to_in_person_exam/,1726540414.0,"It was stated previously on the syllabus that the imm250 final exam will be online, but suddenly the prof made an announcement that it is in person. The biggest issue is that she announced it right on the enrolment deadline.

Thought about complaining, but feel like they will just give excuses (e.g. the online exam mentioned in the previous syllabus is referring to the ""practice"" exam / it was the old version and we should check the new version)

1st pic is the announcement at 7am today; 2nd pic is the old version of syllabus about final exam; 3rd pic is the updated version of syllabus

You should let the whole class know about this, as changing the evaluation scheme without consulting students is a violation of the article above.",comment,11

The faculty of Arts and Science Academic Handbook states that after the methods of evaluation and their relative weights have been made known to the class, the instructor may not change them without the consent of a simple majority of students (more than 50%) attending the class.

It is insanely insulting that we got this change on the last day to enrol in courses. No vote also feels like being stabbed and the knife gets twisted in and out in circles. Our professor and the department broke a policy violation. We should honestly all complain",comment,10
