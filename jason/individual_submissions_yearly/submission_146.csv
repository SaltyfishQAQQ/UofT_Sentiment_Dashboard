Utm I guess is just better at negotiation and I guess miway is nicer, and Im also guessing since the stop is from outside of Toronto into Toronto the ttc doesn't have a say? plus we don't even need to pay for the normal bus, it's  included in tuition.",comment,2

I think a school bus also doesn't charge people directly, funded by taxes. The shuttle bus is also paid, it's like 7 dollars for non utm students, so it's more of a coach type bus.  
  
In terms of public transit:  
I mean it's pretty much 2 buses that brings u directly to utsg in around 1.5 hrs from utm. Utsc is the same, pretty much 2 buses brings you to utsg in a bit over 1hr.   


I think its just the fact that miway is just more chill in terms of routes than ttc, you can see it with the student benefits, like a semester pass, imagine the ttc giving a go/ttc pass, not imaginable.",comment,1
