"Extremely mentally unwell and afraid to fail, is it over for me? CW for substance use and mental health",CartoonJunkie_,1gt583l,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gt583l/extremely_mentally_unwell_and_afraid_to_fail_is/,1731816228.0,"second year artsci student, did very well academically last year but spiraled into substance abuse issues and other issues around late april this year. have been keeping myself afloat in classes, but now everything is due in two weeks and i have so much work to do it is crushing. i know i could do the work if i sat down and made myself and all but i can't get myself to do it. i feel like i am going to fail all my classes and thus throw away all my progress and money. genuinely so crushed by thinking about this all the time my substance use is getting worse and i'm further putting off the work because of it. i don't even want to drink, i've just made it a compulsion.
i don't know why i am posting this because i know nothing is going to help me out of this situation except myself. 
has anybody been in a similar situation and made it out alive? lol. 

i hope if anybody reads this you're doing well",submission,48

Highly recommend reaching out to student services, as they may be able to hook you up with a professional to talk to.

Outside of institutional resources, if you’ve got some friends or family you feel comfortable talking about it to, do it. Don’t make things harder on yourself by facing it alone if you don’t have to.

Depending on how much you’re drinking, you might need to go to the hospital when you try to quit. If you’re a heavy daily drinker, quitting cold turkey can trigger lethal seizures, and you’ll need a doctor to help with those withdrawals.

Life is hard and it sort of keeps getting harder, but I swear to god man you’ve always got a reason to keep fighting. If you can’t see that reason clearly right now, fight for the chance to someday soon.",comment,17

It sounds cringe but please talk to a campus resource or counsellor. Your registrar may even be able to work out a temporary accessibility arrangement for you.,comment,8

As of now, I would only recommend getting in touch with a professional that you can talk to since that would help you get the documentation you need (so that if need be, you can defer your exams/assignments). I have also been mentally ill to the point of not being able to meet final deadlines and thankfully had profs who were willing to accommodate past the hard deadline too (which is usually in January for fall semester). But even getting through the petition process can be tedious, it’s not the most accessible because they think students will take advantage of the system so they usually ask for any documentation you can provide. I really hope you get better my friend :) this will pass too!",comment,2

There's more to life than studying all day if you're feeling overwhelmed and seek therapy; substance use can be incredibly dangerous. Had a former high school classmate that was a 4.0 GPA student in med school and passed away due to OD from his struggle with depression and anxiety",comment,2
