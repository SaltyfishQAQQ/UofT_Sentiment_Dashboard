When I was first applying to universities, I applied to UBC, UVic, and MUN. I got accepted to MUN and UVic, got waitlisted for UBC. Then when my IB finals were already done for senior year, I had decided to go MUN because my mom and my brother lived in Newfoundland, and I had just spent 2.5 years living with just my dad in Norway  (long story) so my mom wanted me close by. I had told her that if I ended up getting accepted into UBC though, I would prefer going there. But I didn't get accepted, so MUN it was. 

But my high school friends had all gotten accepted into these prestigious universities, and I felt that I could've done better than I did when it came to universities. One of my friends was going to UofT in engsci, and told me that I could transfer. I had told him I didn't know where I would even go, and he suggested UofT because their political science program was also top in the country. So I spent my entire first year (literally, I started prepping my application and took notes of the deadlines in July) preparing and planning to transfer. 

UBC was my ""dream school"" in the sense that I had really wanted to go to a larger, better university than MUN. But UofT was my end-goal as soon as I realized that transferring was still an option, even though I didn't apply the first time around.",comment,1
