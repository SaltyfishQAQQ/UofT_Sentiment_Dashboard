U of T was actually the only school I applied to, so it means a lot to me. I know it’s one of the best schools in the world, but sometimes I feel a bit weird about how people talk about it.

I’m from China, and there’s this app back home (let’s call it XHS) that’s kind of like Reddit. Sometimes when I try to say something good about U of T, especially when people post negative stuff about it, I get attacked. People have even called me a “watchdog” for U of T, which is a pretty rude term in Chinese. It’s just crazy how much negativity there is, and it’s started to make me doubt myself.

Some people say U of T students are just the ones who couldn’t get into good universities in China, or that U of T is only as good as a mid-50th ranked university there. It honestly gets to me. Every time I tell someone I got into U of T, they’re like, “Oh, so you’re just average.” It’s so frustrating. Has anyone else dealt with this? How do you handle it?",submission,109

No wonder they’re upset. They’re studying 16h days to get into (probably) a university in China that’s sub top-500 worldwide, so basically no reputation outside China. That was worth more back when the Chinese job prospects weren’t so terrible. Now you can graduate, get a job easier, and likely earn twice their income working half the hours.

Yes,  undergrad program admits way too many people so it seems easy to get in, also the teaching quality for undergrad is abysmal.

Then let's talk about grad programs, is it easy to get into a researched based master program or phd program, hell no, the admission rate is single digit percent, and the grad students here are competitive, talented and diligent to make uofts ranking top of the world. Even lots of tsinghua grad students work in one of uofts labs.

My point is, study hard, make yourself distinguished. Make your school proud of your accomplishments and dont be a loser that always brags about your school and Mr I know a guy who works at nasa, and you don't give a shit about what others think.

People who talks about how awesome their school is all day and not themselves, yes, you know they are absolute a disgrace to whoever admits them in the first place",comment,10

Now that they are finding their feet, they are rightfully proud of their accomplishments and eager to take their place in the world as a global power. 

The downside of this trauma is that many people have a brittle / status-focused idea of worth. The idea of ‘saving face’ is similar to the idea of avoiding shame at almost all costs, including elevating oneself. 

The Chinese government also encourages an ethnocentric view in part in order to support loyalty which works to varying degrees. 

All of this is to say that Chinese people may have widely valued a UofT education a couple of decades ago. Now, the pendulum has swung and your peers may be trying to express pride in Chinese universities in an insecure and aggressive way.

I don’t think there will be a way to reach consensus with someone who is trying to elevate themselves above you. Rather, close your heart a bit to them. If you can, see the vulnerability and trauma beneath their arrogance. Tell them you are proud of them. Assert your own boundaries if necessary and suggest comparisons are not necessary, useful, or kind. The people who insist on continuing to try to put you down will make it clear that their friendships are not worthwhile. 

Best of luck!",comment,4

Who cares what random online haters say about your life decisions? Instead think about your life goals and people you actually care about. They can brag about the prestige of their Chinese schools but for the most part that only matters in China. As a UofT graduate you'll have a way easier time navigating Western countries and benefiting from your degree than if you went to even Tsinghua or whatever.

Regardless of that, I’m not familiar with Chinese culture dynamics but isn’t harder to attend a school on the other side of the world where you’re far away from your family, friends, culture, language and familiarity? U of T isn’t just hard academically, outside of getting good grades and staying enrolled to graduate you literally have to find time to care of yourself in all possible ways. You have to find friends, meet new people, speak and learn in a different language, get up every day and take care of yourself without your family being there. It is challenging academically and outside of it, I’m not sure why others would discredit your hard work other than ignorance or just wanting to be rude.

UofT is easy to get in, especially for undergraduate programs. Its reputation comes from graduate research not undergrad. The education quality is shockingly low because the lectures are huge and professors could barely notice you. With that said, earning a bachelor’s degree at UofT isn’t any easier than the US universities, and could even be harder. There are people who decide to go to UofT because they missed Tsinghua or Peking by a few points, there are also people who could barely write an essay that got into UofT, the variance is huge.

I think the reason they think U of T or any other universities that are not top 10 in the world are bad because for first, fresh graduates in China tend to pursue postgraduate studies at any wide known universities however a great majority of them do not do it for the sake of their interests in studies, it is more about getting a diploma in a wide known school so that when they go back to China, they are more recognised by Chinese employers. Secondly, some of these people also tend to take on the most niche courses with exceptionally low entry requirements just to get in or they just donate money to get in which is why people perceive schools such as U of T, Manchester, Edinburgh as cheap unis. I think these people that say this are absolutely stupid because they dont know how hard it is to get into these unis. But I also cannot disregard that I dont really like the fact that people solely go to a university just for its recognition instead of the knowledge and skills that can be gained from the course.

Don't be too worried about it anyway. In the end, what matters is your own achievements. Not a label. 

Canadian Universities took a hit on popularity but so did elite universities like Stanford because of the amount of people nit picking on some people.

And if serves of relief, I am from Brazil and experienced not in the same level of mean comments but some side comments as a joke. By what I read in the comments, in Brazil, you also need to do a test that takes several days and doesn't even bother to look at your face or care to interview you. It is a crazy system that people need to abandon your social and quality of life all high school if you want to get in the Federal Universities. They are usually ranked the best but have so few seats because they are also for free. It is not a wise selection process as it eliminates all the importance of other activities like volunteering and doing social work to only focus in numbers as if we were machines.

My brother got approved for the USP, the University of Sao Paulo, for a traditional bachelor's degree, and I didn't because I could not make a good exam under the pressure of the test. When I applied for UofT, the process was so much more humane, I could talk to people and express myself. My summer volunteering  and NGO were taken into consideration.

Not to mention, the system at UofT allows us to get much better grades in general. Back home, because it is free, the professor will not think twice if they want to fail you despite your work. It is not uncommon for the professor to fail 30% of the class, so the average grade there is around 60/100. This makes it so hard for you to get into good masters in Europe or even here.

On the other hand, I never expected I would get so many high grades because it is not an endless cycle of tests after tests of stuff that I will probably never need in my professional work. We can spend much more time networking with people who actually will make it easier to land a nice job. So in the end, it was a gift from the destiny, and my brother is killing himself to be able to finish his bachelor's inside the typical 5 years. I will finish mine in four. 😄 

I want to work in interestind research and lets be honest: You can't expect an institution to rank in the top largest research centers and keep the same rigor as when published just researches that are way to elaborate or that people not even read. People can say whatever they want, we are still a reference.",comment,8

If your only achievement is getting into UofT it's not much of an achievement. It's up to OP to do something with their degree and make their own achievements.

They're basically fighting each other's ranking every year. They are the same. 

I swear these guys are just mad that most high ranked unis don't require some stupid test that people have been studying since a toddler. Hence, ""easier"" to get in and less good. 

So they shit on anything that isn't a US university because that's the only other set of institutions they respect.

Who cares about these guys anyways? There's a wide world out there and no country gives that much detail into test scores. It's about the education and connection you make. Not the ranking.

Recruited athletes, legacies and donors also mess up the meritocracy.

The admissions process is also tougher because of the universities' relatively small size. Example: Ivy League schools have undergraduate populations ranging from 4,447 students (Dartmouth) to 16K students (Cornell). In Canada, 16K would be considered midsize, about the number of undergrads at Dalhousie. Stanford has 8K undergrads, MIT: a mere 4,500. Meanwhile, U of T has over **78K** undergrads across all 3 campuses.",comment,1

I used to study at a regular Chinese high school, and while I did well academically, I hated the environment there. We had these political lectures that basically forced us to believe certain strange ideas, and if you didn’t go along with it, you’d risk suspension. Honestly, it felt more like a prison than a school.

After that, I transferred to an international high school that offered A-Levels, and at first, it felt like a relief. I finally got to study subjects I liked, like economics and psychology, and I didn’t have to deal with the ones I hated, like politics and Chinese. But everything took a turn when I got bullied by another student. This person even tried to physically attack me at school and threatened me. The worst part? That student was related to the headmaster, so the administration did absolutely nothing to help me. Instead, they had the nerve to tell me to apologize to them. I was beyond pissed, but there was nothing I could do.

So, I decided to leave that place this January. Thankfully, I managed to get four pretty decent A-Level scores, and now I’m here at U of T.",comment,2

The public is the best one and  has the ""label"". The public one is 100% government funded but it is very hard to get in. The mentality is that the university who fails their students the most is seen as the desired places to be. But to be honest becomes a little cut throat. Because you it is for free some professors have a no mercy or understanding. If you fail 3 times in the same subject you get quicked put and it happens far more frequently than you would think.

The ranking of the universities in the country works mostly by blind test of randomly selected students.
The university is taken as grade mostly because they selected the people of the state that were the best in doing tests, not because the university is making them great kind of thing.


Here there is a much more focus on personal branding and selling yourself kind of thing. We never receive this type of training. We dont spend a lot of time thinking that we need to convince someone of we are good.

People mostly rely of the ""brand"" of the university and if you are able to survive the hunger games they take as if you know the technical stuff and the culture of the company you learn. Self promotion is easiely seen as arrogance and very often ridiculed. 

You may notice Brazilians take a while to understand that it is normal North America and that Conviction and Confidence always with the job despite the technical abilities.
