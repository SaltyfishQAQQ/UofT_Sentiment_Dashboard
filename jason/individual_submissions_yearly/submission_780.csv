"CS in stream enrollment increased massively this year, and what this means for out of stream PoST",NotAName320,1e6rilo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1e6rilo/cs_in_stream_enrollment_increased_massively_this/,1721351611.0,"hey guys, last april I made [a post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1c4j3vt/cs_out_of_stream_post_this_year_will_likely_have/) about CS PoST out of stream chances based on enrollment in in-stream and out of stream CS courses respectively, and I wanna follow up now that first years have enrolled so we can check them for 2024-25.

last year, at the beginning of the year, around 320 kids enrolled in csc110. to compare, this year, there are at least **490** (420 enrolled in a lecture + 75 distinct people waitlisted for csc110 lec0201), though the exact number won't be known until they fix the lecture capacity and everyone in-stream gets actually enrolled in a lecture.

490 is the highest seen since timetable tracker has been a thing, and if worst comes to worst, might result in the return of the cutoffs from 3-4 years ago which were high 80s or higher just to get into PoST. for context, the cs department themselves states that they admit 500 students into a major/specialist, along with 50 data science specialists (this is inferred, they actually give 550 as a number combining cs and data science), so in worst case scenario, if every cs post student meets the guarantee and for some reason doesn't choose data science, we're looking at a measly 10 spots or so for out of stream.

but on a lighter note, it seems like csc165 enrollment is down massively too, so you're competing with much less out-of-stream students, and there will probably be fewer competition from upper years after last year they let so much people in. in addition, there's always the possibility that the cs department is increasing capacity in its programs this year, but this is never a guarantee.

**tl;dr: much more in stream students, less out-of-stream students, overall though out of stream post will probably be harder**",submission,22

I was out of stream back in **2021-2022**, where CSC110 started with 500 spots, all of which were full, so **500 students started in-stream**. 

Speaking from experience (and stalking enrolment spots in 110/111 at the time), about 30 students dropped out of 110 in the first semester (if I remember correctly). In the end, about 60 out-of-stream students were admitted to the specialist/major, and I was one of them. The cutoff for admission seemed to be between around high 80's to low 90's, and I personally got in with high 90s in both 148/165. I knew people with 90s in one course that still got rejected. I'd expect competition to be a bit lower than this given there are fewer people in 165 this time around, so I'd say mid to low 80s (which is the grade the department tends to cite as an estimate of an out of stream cutoff â€” an A or higher). 

Admissions were a bit of a mess in my year, both from high school and from in/out of stream, and I'd expect things to go smoother this time around. I kind of doubt out of stream will be as bad as my year, but we'll have to see if I'm proven wrong. I'm surprised there's a waitlist though, 110 usually has enough spots for all in-stream students. 

Even if the bar seems high, there's not much less you can do than any other year. If you put your best effort into 148/165 and have fun with the material, you'll probably have a good chance of getting in. They're really fun courses and I always tried to focus on that over my stress, even though that got difficult many times. 

**TL;DR it was worse than this in my year and (to the best of my knowledge) 60-ish people got in from out of stream. Try not to doompost too hard, and do the best you can in 148/165 regardless.**

**AMENDMENT: Knowing the numbers now, this year had 525 students in CSC110 at the start, which means this year is now likely to be the hardest for out of stream admissions, sorry to say.**",comment,11

Normally should be about 80 spots ish for non in stream student assuning it was the max from before 420. And asumme about 60 drop as what the first comment said. So say about 120 spots left for non in stream

But this year its 520ish number of students. So then the number of spots left for in stream would be 20-30ish. Then 60ish drop (assuming as what first comment said again). Total number of spots left will probably be around 80-90ish. Cutt off will probably become disgusting again.


What do yall think cutoff will most likely be for non in stream this year?

Imma say high 80s mabye even low 90s.",comment,2

I can see how it could happen tbh. The people in the cs department admitting the students probably aren't the same as the people assigning lecture sizes for the courses, and presumably no one in the cs department decided to do a headcount before assuming there would be under 420 cs seats. 

Honestly cs course selection in general has been a mess this year, nearly every second year cs student got waitlisted for STA237 cause of the stupid tiered waitlists and also CSC258 practicals were bugged for some stupid reason as well. But I digress.",comment,2

also ultimately a lot of people just genuinely like studying CS, and you definitely can't predict the job market in 3 years",comment,1

STA237 is be expected honestly, the stats dept is known to be overall less organized and I don't think they properly compensated for the removal of STA247 (where Most 2nd year CS students would typically enrol). 

200-level CS courses can get tight but you haven't seen the 300-400 levels yet. Those are always the hunger games (my year took all the spots in 368 before the third years could even enrol). 

Wdym 258 tuts were bugged? That's happened before, though possibly in a different way. Just asking out of curiosity.",comment,1
