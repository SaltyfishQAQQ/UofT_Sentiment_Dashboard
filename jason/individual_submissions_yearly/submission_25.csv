Cool to see UofT win their first nobel in 17 years, even if it was given for something that really is not physics. Curious what everyone thinks.",comment,198

I am glad the prize is expanding its definition of physics.

[Edit] Don't get me wrong, I love Hinton's work; it just doesn't feel like a physics discovery. I see it more as a set of tools that can be applied to physics, much like mathematics. It feels like the committee wanted to recognize machine learning and found a way to do so. I'm not trying to dismiss Hinton's work (as a fan and admirer), but we have to be honest with ourselves and acknowledge that he didn't make a discovery in physics. I 100% understand why he won the Turing Award, but a Nobel in physics feels odd.

I think it's clear that the physics community (just as he was: https://youtu.be/-icD_KmvnnM?si=R7bh-syLxKrCHuPl) is just as confused by this news, especially since there is no shortage of high-quality researcher making actual physics discoveries.",comment,34

You can research Physics Informed Machine Learning. In any case it's a very interdisciplinary field drawing upon many fields of research.

For example, itâ€™s quite common for the chemistry prize to go to biologists, biochemists and physicists, and for the prizes in physics or economics to go to mathematicians or CS.

[Hereâ€™s the official blurb from the Nobel foundation](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/press-release/):  
>Geoffrey Hinton used the Hopfield network as the foundation for a new network that uses a different method: the Boltzmann machine. This can learn to recognise characteristic elements in a given type of data. Hinton used tools from statistical physics, the science of systems built from many similar components. The machine is trained by feeding it examples that are very likely to arise when the machine is run. The Boltzmann machine can be used to classify images or create new examples of the type of pattern on which it was trained. Hinton has built upon this work, helping initiate the current explosive development of machine learning.

Side note: economics was added later and is officially the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel.

However the basis of neural networks is in physics and the logic is mathematics. It looks very similar to theoretical physics actually. It doesnâ€™t have to be about protons and electrons and space to be physics (even though thatâ€™s my realm haha). The prize is well deserved. Not only is their work very close to physics that the delineation is strange thing to bring up. The prize used to not go to experimentalists. Many experimentalist who contributed more than theoretician didnâ€™t get prizes. So itâ€™s important for a prize like this to expand it definition. My undergrad is in engineering and only recently has the chemistry prize gone to materials engineers and physics prize gone to Eng phys / EE.,comment,5

Hintons work is a physicist simulating how a brain works. He used physics of the Brain to build the first neural nets. They look nothing like AI today and is more akin to a biopsyhicist trying to make a model that self generates neural pathways. I am not in this research however. That is the physics aspect to it. he may get lumped into AI but in reality his work is very theoretical nothing akin to ChatGPT for example,comment,2

Nowadays the language in the field of machine learning essentially has no overlap with anything from physics, except for the occasional mention of some stat mech concepts, but almost none of the researchers interpret these concepts from a physical perspective, just in an abstract one. This prize is being awarded in the context of how successful deep nets are today, but these models don't have much overlap with physics in their current form. It feels a bit weird to say that a big reason this award was given out today was because Sam Altman successfully marketed ChatGPT. Just doesn't quite sit right. No discredit at all to Hinton's work, an absolute pioneer.",comment,3
