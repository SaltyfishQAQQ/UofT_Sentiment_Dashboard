UofT has that reputation; it’s spread out in the middle of a major city, a lot of people commute and a lot of us also got stuck in the COVID years and didn't/couldn't make friends.

If any of you guys are like me, texting is often less intimidating and a lot more comfortable than approaching and talking to random strangers for 10 seconds before the professor starts teaching.

Drop your numbers/instagrams below :)

Edit: in my brain fog from exam week, i forgot that normal people don’t like giving their numbers out to random people on the internet hahha. if you’ve  got other suggestions on ways to connect please comment it below

Edit 2: Okay instagram is probably the best one. so drop ur instas below!",submission,30

There are 2 possibilities for struggling to make friends: hostile environment and lack of social skills. Since there are people who have friends at U of T, those who post here likely suffer from the latter.

Making a group of people with no social skills is just asking for disaster",comment,7

The logical format being used is as follows:
1. Either A or B must be true
2. B is false
3. Therefore A is true

In your scenario, there are many reasons for people being poor, so (1) is a false premise. Here is another example of false premise: “Oranges are either automobiles or aeroplanes. Oranges are not aeroplanes, therefore oranges are automobiles.”

In my scenario, the fact that many people have many friends tells us that the environment isn’t so hostile that nobody is making friends, therefore the environment is permissive to making friends. As such, the other option has to be true.

Lack of social skills is nothing to be ashamed of; it’s something everyone learns at some point. The trick is actually being receptive to inputs and letting go of some of this “individuality” that our society loves to push on us for some reason",comment,1

We can only know that it is not so bad, that no one can make money there. Many factors can lead to poverty.

The same goes if some people can make friends in a certain environment, we can only know that making friends is possible. Many factors can lead to not making friends.",comment,1
