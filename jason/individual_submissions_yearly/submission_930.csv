I graduate tomorrow (masters) and would like to know how people carry their phones during the ceremony. What have you done? 

How do I keep my phone on my person? I'll be wearing a robe...do I carry a small bag? 

Thank you. ",submission,15

Trousers/pants or a dress with pockets are your best option. Don't carry a bag unless it's a tiny one that you can wear across your body under your robe. You probably want to keep your phone on you because the ceremony can be long and boring, and it can be hard to find your family/friends afterwards without your phone.",comment,31
