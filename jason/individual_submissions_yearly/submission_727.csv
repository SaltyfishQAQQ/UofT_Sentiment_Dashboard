Don’t procrastinate, do the readings, participate in tutorials with vigour, and study efficiently.

Also, from speaking with others individuals at different institutions, you will likely find that material is covered faster and at more depth. 

Just adjust your expectations and remember this school likes to maintain C+ to B averages for most courses… What that means is only a certain percentage of the class will get 80’s. It’s not outright grade deflation but if the class is doing too well, I would expect a brutal final, midterm, or very strict marking to correct the average. Just be forewarned.",comment,17

Go to class, do the readings, turn in work on time, and participate in tutorials and you should be able to do it.  


TBH, I think U of T's difficulty is overrated. From what I've seen, many students really just aren't trying very hard. For example, many social sciences classes have participation worth 10-15%, which is basically free marks - but typically only like a third of a given class ever participates.",comment,11

However it does require a lot of effort from you - a lot of people IMO do not take the time to recognize what studying habits work well for them and will acquiesce to the last minute cramming method, or won’t take the time to repeat understand the material. Plan ahead, take the time to actually learn what methods work for you, talk to your profs, if you don’t understand something ask, study properly and don’t just cram. It might take a minute to get the hang of but after a rocky 1st year, when I actually spent time identifying how I could succeed and perform well, I was able to get mostly A+s by my 4th year.",comment,5

If you go to every class and do every assignment and just pass most tests your already looking at around 70%. If you have consistent study habits your likely to get at least 80%. Most courses are averaging in around 70-75%, it's not that hard to get a 5-10% on top of that.",comment,2

Do your readings on time, or at least use ChatGPT to summarize them. Get started on assignments as soon as the instructions are out and refine them whenever you have free time till the due date. UofT is hard for everyone, but in my experience with this university there is a positive correlation between grades and effort (something that did not exist while I did my A Levels).",comment,-3
