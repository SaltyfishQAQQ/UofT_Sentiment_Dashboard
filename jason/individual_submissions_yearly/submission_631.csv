Believe me, I‚Äôm going through something similar with managing my mental health and school after my father‚Äôs passing. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you should give up.

Studying for an exam is not only about learning course stuff. Exams are a test of your knowledge, yes, but also a test of resilience, of ENDURANCE. They test your unwavering will and determination.

Feeling the pressure as if it was the weight of the world on your shoulders will make you feel hopeless and in despair. But you are here for a reason. You‚Äôve come this far, to one of the top universities in the world. That means people see something in you, they see great potential. ‚ÄúWith great power there must also come great responsibility.‚Äù

Don‚Äôt look at the big picture right now. Take it one step at a time. Focus on what‚Äôs right in front of you. Take a deep breath and continue.

And I won‚Äôt sugarcoat it, you might fail, and it will hurt your ego as a stab to the heart. But every bruise, every cut, every moment of despair is but a chance to make yourself stronger. It is not about how many times you fall, but how many times you get back up. Don‚Äôt let a stumble define you, let your answer to that stumble define you.

So you‚Äôve got two choices: you either give up now, or you stand up, look at the problem to the face and say ‚ÄúI can do this all day.‚Äù

Even if you fail, you will look in the mirror every morning, and you will be proud of the person that made their best and built character. Remember, ‚Äúwhy do we fall? So that we can learn to pick ourselves up.‚Äù

Do your best to get that passing grade, but if you don‚Äôt get it, keep in mind that what matters is how you handle this failure. 

So you‚Äôre going to study now, and study hard. You‚Äôre going to fight to get the best grade you can, ok? Go show them how resilient you are.

‚ÄúIf you step out that door, you are an Avenger.‚Äù",comment,3
