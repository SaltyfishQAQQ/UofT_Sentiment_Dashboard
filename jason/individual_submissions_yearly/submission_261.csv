The REAL lowdown on U of T tl;dr so you don't have to ready a thesis,USAtoUofT,1et6bvw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1et6bvw/the_real_lowdown_on_u_of_t_tldr_so_you_dont_have/,1723755540.0,"Long story short:

In the US, a lot of top tier schools weed people out at the admissions stage, but then have some inflated grades once you're in so the schoolwork itself isn't as stressful.

At U of T, it's a bit inverted. It's much easier to get in, but the actual schoolwork itself is - in some cases - graded so your grades are actually a bit *deflated* in comparison to other schools of a similar caliber. You also may have to compete and get a certain grade to get into your program during your first year regardless if you were accepted into the university as a whole.

There are pros and cons to both ways. Yes, getting a higher grade is generally easier at similar universities in the US, but you may have not been able to get into the school at all depending on your application.

Yes it's easier to get into U of T so you have a better chance of getting an opportunity to go here, but once you're in the fight ain't over and grading is strict.

There. Now you don't have to read a thesis from some of these other posts.

People either donâ€™t know or donâ€™t understand that. Unless you end up with sub 1.85 GPA you are working towards an Honours Bachelors. To do that at other universities you have to work harder as well! (Please, correct me on the details if you can explain better)",comment,56

UWO & Mac). At those schools Honours degrees are comparable to UofT's Specialist major in that there are: more courses required in the major, you need to maintain a higher GPA, and you have to complete a senior thesis. Otherwise completing a 120 credit/4 year degree without those requirements would just be a regular 4 year degree.

Typically Honours degrees are designed for students wanting to pursue graduate school after graduation.",comment,4

At some schools you get a bachelorâ€™s in 3 years and an honours bachelorâ€™s in 4. Usually thatâ€™s to complete an additional thesis, research project, etc - which many at U of T do it their 4th year anyway. Each school does it a little different, but I would say that the breadth and intensity of the 4 year Honours bachelor at U of T probably is overall, fairly comparable to other schoolsâ€™ honours bachelorâ€™s.",comment,1
