while i'm happy with the few friendships i've made, i still feel like i need more. would anyone have recommendations for smaller clubs/organizations where it might be easier to make closer connections to the other members?",submission,18

For the first you gotta be driven and have an open mind, for the second you have to prove your worth to the group somehow. There's no easy way to do either.",comment,1

I'm in the fanfiction club, and its a fairly small club, but very welcoming and because everyone has a very specific interest in something relatively niche, there is an instant connection with most people there! Just follow your passions if you have a hobby or something you would be interested in join a club centered around it.",comment,1
