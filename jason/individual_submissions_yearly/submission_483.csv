- i use the pomodoro technique to study (25 study, 5min break and then a 30min break after 4 sets) 
- it helps me to know that if i study for just 25 minutes i can rest for 5 minutes (take a stretch, walk, etc) 
- try to do something you know you will enjoy when you take a break (i like to do the puzzle on 4th of robarts library, and it makes me feel so much less stressed and enjoyable than just scrolling on my phone :) taking walks, reading, power nap, etc are other good ways to take a break)

***create out a study plan
- it helps me to visually see everything i have to do for each course
- BE SPECIFIC AND BREAK DOWN YOUR TASKS when you plan it out (ex. if you need to read unit 10, you could break it down further into read 10.1, 10.2.. etc)
- its less overwhelming that way and when you finish one little task it motivates you as you can see your progress as to just saying read all of unit 10.

***SLEEP and EAT
- its better to get a good nights rest than to overwork yourself.
- and sleeping at 5am for 8 hours and sleeping at 10pm and getting the same amount of hours is different.
- knowing what time you study best also helps to maintain productivity without burnout 

***Balance 
 - dont pressure yourself to study all the time just because everyone else seems like they are 
- its key to have a balance
- meet with friends, family, enjoy some hobbies here and then
- it will make you feel better
- also it helps to try and make studying like a game not just something you dread doing
- once you enjoy what you learn, studying can become enjoyable (but it all takes time and figuring yourself out :))

These are just some things that worked for me :) 

everyone has their tough moments but its the healthy habits that they have to not be in burnout! Its totally normal and youre doing great! Just take it slowly one step at a time. Good luck!!!",comment,10

Instead of going to the library, trying to do work and then just slacking off, tell yourself that you're going to slack off beforehand.

For example: set aside tomorrow to just do whatever. No matter what happens, promise yourself that not a single piece of work will get done tomorrow. You'll probably feel much better on Wednesday and be much more productive than if you forced yourself to work on Tuesday (and you probably wouldn't have gotten anything done since you would've been burnt out )",comment,4

\- talk to highly motivated people in ur courses who r chasing the 4.0 and study with them

\- dont try to pull crazy 8 hour study days 5 days a week that is crazy and isnt good

\- make sure you relax by going outside and having fun with your friends instead of being online for all of your breaks 

good luck!",comment,3

I think the most important thing you need to know is that it’s okay to trip and fall a little, I’m not saying to do it intentionally, but if it happens, it happens. Gotta give yourself the affirmation of that you are going to try your hardest, and do the best you can for where you want to be. 

As of burn out, it happens to all of us. Sometimes we need to visualize a plan, maybe taking an hour to plan out your calendar for the duration of finals and how much you want to get done. When things are done in routine, it doesn’t feel like burnout, it feels like lifestyle, adjusting to what you need. You need to hold yourself accountable if you’re slacking too.

Sleep is really important. Get enough sleep, if you’re feeling tired while you’re studying a Power Nap is much better than just downing a can of red bull. Sleep early, wake up early and study early, go do some activities, a walk, the gym, talk to some friends, let yourself breathe. There isn’t a good (healthy) student without some sort of social life for themselves. And eat properly, like foods that will give you energy, and not things that are just going to give you a sugar rush or a headache. 

But then again, these are things that I did. Also, this is just a side note, I used to feel productive in the library, but realistically I wasn’t. Instead I had to adapt to my study style, I tested out new things, studying in my room, libraries, outside, but the one thing that was the most productive for me was a coffee shop. Ironically enough, I need background noise + my music and I can sit down for 5 hours (my back hurts eventually) and really lock in. It takes time to find a rhythm like that, but I wish you best of luck with your exams!! You got this!",comment,2
