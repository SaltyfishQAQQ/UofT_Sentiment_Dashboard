I saw a man trailing behind me in a car while I was walking and then about 10 seconds later, he stopped me and asked for directions to Pearson Airport. I said it was far from here and he said ""I know"" and that he didn't have data. Then, I pulled up Google Maps and he asked if he could take a picture, I said sure. Aside: I thought he would take the picture here and leave because I was already leaning inside the front passenger window (I'm so close to him like 1.5 feet away so a picture shouldn't be a problem). However, he reversed the car suddenly and quickly, making me jump out of the window and my feet barely survived the front wheels. He pulled back into a side street motioning me forward. I grudgingly showed the phone towards his face but apparently, he needed to hold my phone to take a photo (The brightness is at 60% and I was holding it less than 1 foot away from his face). I said ""No, I can hold it"" (my phone was unlocked on Google Maps). He drove the car away quickly after that (For the 2nd time, I had to save my feet and popped out of the window quickly when I saw his expression change) and he mumbled ""You think I am going to steal your phone"". Was this a tactic that people used to steal in Toronto? I had other encounters asking for directions but no one needed to ""hold my phone"" while they were in a vehicle. 

P.S. I noticed that another man was watching me before the ""direction man"" moved to the side street.",submission,124

Here's [TPS' warning](https://www.tps.ca/my-neighbourhood/crime-prevention/distraction-theft/).

Here's the [TPS online reporting](https://www.tps.ca/services/online-reporting/) for non-emergencies. Campus security is a good suggestion.

It's doubtful someone from TPS will interview you since no crime was committed. If you got the license plate, make and model of the car, they'll send these details to gang crime.

These are part of organized crime in Toronto where like pickpockets, they work an area. This one with unsuspecting students who think people in cars honestly get lost. If someone owns a car, they can afford a cell phone. 

Good you're alright because they were probably sizing up any jewelry to grab off you.

Keep cell phones in deep pockets. There's been a couple of recent pickpocket organized crime rings who are grabbing cell phones (usually sticking out a little in someone's back pocket or in an open purse). A few lost theirs at the Electric Island rave and the Pride Festival. Some were traced to Jane and Finch, a well known area for gangs, drugs and gun crime.",comment,25

this is because if your phone is password unlocked, they can just go in and swipe your bank card, go on your social media and ask your friends for money, and go into your uoft email and spam everybody

# 2 do not engage

if you sense the least bit of suspicion, just say ""sorry I don't that that information, I need to get somewhere"" and just leave

  
> if they say ""You think I am going to steal your phone""

clearly they even said what they are thinking, so you can say something like this

For example, do not pull out your phone to help someone with directions. If you don't know where the place is by memory, just say you don't know. Otherwise give simple, human understandable directions. 

In your case I would just tell the person to take any main road southbound, until they encounter a highway and then take the highway west. Then there will be signs for the airport on the highway.

Or just point in the direction of the airport and walk away üòÇ",comment,5

He may have just wanted to steal your phone. But I also never get within arms reach of someone‚Äôs car door anymore. It‚Äôs actually a popular way to kidnap (I went through a phase of watching true kidnapping stories). They pull the victim in through the window. 

So the thing with criminals is sometimes they know the kind of person they are looking for and what they want to do. (E.g. they are looking for a female with brown hair, and they want to rape). The last remaining thing they need is what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù. So when the opportunity strikes, such as when someone happens to be close to their car, they take advantage of that ‚Äúopportunity‚Äù to begin to commit their crime. 

Based on the fact that he quickly tried to drive away, it seems like he just wanted to steal your phone. But yeah, there‚Äôs a lot of other reasons people want you close to their passenger window. 

I am suppperr glad you are safe. 

People can always be directed to the library where there is free wifi. Or put them in touch with a TTC worker. Or they can drive around for a Starbucks. 

But much better safe than sorry.",comment,9

A variant is a woman in the passenger seat that requests the info and then offers a chain and a blessing for your help.
