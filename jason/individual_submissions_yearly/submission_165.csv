I knew a guy in the early 80s who sometimes talked about cruising in Queen‚Äôs Park. You don‚Äôt need to worry about the people who are cruising, they are only interested in other people who are cruising. 

If you are the only person or thing moving, someone‚Äôs attention will naturally be drawn to you. Just ignore them, and be aware of your surroundings.
