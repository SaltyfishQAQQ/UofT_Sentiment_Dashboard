Will UofT ever combine timetable builder and acorn? ,Chickenfingers_fries,1dybtj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dybtj6/will_uoft_ever_combine_timetable_builder_and_acorn/,1720452692.0,"Like the title says. Other universities like UBC have combined both on to one website where you can create a draft schedule and save it then on course enrollment day you just have to register. 

That way you don’t need to keep switching between timetable builder and acorn. 

Just curious, cus sometimes UofT feels behind on the times. Like for StarRez, some unis like Queens, you can choose the exact room and building you want to stay in and you get a selection time similar to course enrollment time. ",submission,35

Even if they integrate it, I hope they keep a separate access to it active for this purpose.",comment,21

I guess they never thought it to be that big of a need to integrate,comment,24

I doubt we'll see them integrated any time soon. Eventually maybe, but they'd probably need to replace acorn first.",comment,5

Like finalize your schedule on TTB and transfer it to your enrollment cart.  I guess it's too late now though.,comment,4

Plus it would give you the capability of saving multiple draft timetables and tweaking them. 

but maybe you’re right, it works so why change it.",comment,7
