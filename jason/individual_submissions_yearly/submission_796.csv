It's crazy that there were two typos and that they had to call ATS people to tell them about the typos. Also he told us that calculus of variations would be the last unit on the test but there were eigenfunctions and eigenvalues too.,comment,2

Everything up to the final I felt was relatively reasonable, just the final had 33% of the marks from the very last lecture, which I didn't spend much time reviewing so its really on me but unlucky situation.",comment,3
