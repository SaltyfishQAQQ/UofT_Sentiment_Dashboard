""Hi, _____. Hope you're well after the final. I see a huge potential with your insight on this field, which is quite decent. You've always demonstrated strong understanding of course material with your research skills, which interest me. They, however, are slightly less than my standard. As I've been observing your grades and depth of your knowledge, I'm happy to answer your email about my research. I'd recommend staying bit longer on Campus to strengthen your skills, if your time and budget permit. See you after taking a rest.""

(I paraphrased the content cuz I don't wanna reveal myself here)

I didn't ask a research favour by email beforehand, but casually expressed interest in person once. And i've seen him ghosting emails from students whenever he doesnt want to reply email and he heavily prefers to do that (regarding the grade curves and whatever) and this quite confuses me😭

Edit: English is my third language and I once thought if my reading comprehension on English was an issue cuz I still don't know what this means",submission,30

I think this is a rejection specifically from this part: ""They, however, are slightly less than my standard"". I believe if they were interested in offering a position they would have reached out to organize an interview or something. 

Not a professor for the record -- this just feels like a really polite and equivocal way of turning you down.",comment,116

Sometimes great scores translate into a good rudimentary knowledge of the discipline but needs to be backed with additional knowledge on doing research and writing depending on the field.,comment,4

Those are good grades. So much of academia is luck and has nothing to do with you. It could’ve easily been some other prof that could’ve taken you as a master’s student.
