If a class needs to be canceled, instructors are expected to notify students as early as possible through email or Quercus. Instructors must also make alternative arrangements, such as rescheduling the class, providing online materials, arranging for guest lectures, or holding extra office hours to compensate for the missed time.",comment,30

They are employees, they have to abide by set policies and rules. Over all that, they can be the bare minimum of telling the 100 students who show up that they will not be attending.

Imagine paying for a concert, attending at that time, just to have the artist not show up with no prior warning. Then down the line, they mention no refunds or compensation. TeChNiCalLy thEY aRe BusInESseS. 

A better example is when you’re working a job, I hope you tell your client if you’re going to be cancelling a meeting haha. Or would you rather them be upset at the fact they came and you ghosted with no warning. It’s a matter of decency. 

Also, you’d be surprised how much of the “prestigious-ness” can be tainted by word of mouth. The university HAS to care about its students BECAUSE we are the piggy banks. 

I am more than certain if OP emailed the faculty regarding this, the lecturer would be handed an email ensuring to announce their absences. After all, most of them are contractual :)",comment,2

I am a TA/CI and yes, I’ve had emergencies too in the past, but I’ve never failed in communicating this to my students at least three hours in advance, minimum. It’s basic respect. If something really bad happened, I would hope my students would trust me to communicate and apologize at some point the same day. But I’ve seen TAs just not show up consecutive times without even apologizing. 

That said, I know many TAs take their work very seriously and are amazing at their jobs. Hopefully that’s the trend :)",comment,13
