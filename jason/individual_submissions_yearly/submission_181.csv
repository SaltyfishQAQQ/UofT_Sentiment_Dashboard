But while walking around I like to walk alone, and I always walk on this street with a lot of homeless people. I ended up choosing the least likely to murder me and I talk to them. Why do I do that? I'm building up my karma when I'm unemployed living on the streets alone and hoping some random kid stops and talks to me and makes my day. ",submission,152

You can’t guarantee to be rewarded by good deeds so never assume it. There are countless big examples of it including our corrupt government politicians who have retired rich and will retire rich off screwing around with money that’s not theirs",comment,3
