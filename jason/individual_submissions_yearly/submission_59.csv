[It will automatically fetch the information and display it to the courses you are currently enrolled in. ](https://preview.redd.it/hjplw5yraspd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=18370e472b15fb3423bd78d0e29a827b8714c37d)

[You can also search by courses to compare profs.](https://preview.redd.it/1ryfr2yadspd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f2f176dba09829c431d4a4123ee4c8fbb7c4e61)

All it really does is use a background service worker to fetch data from RMP. I then parse its data to get what I want and display it back into the acorn via content scripts. It's nothing too complicated but I'm pretty proud of it.

Please give it a go atÂ [https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rate-my-acorn/jiheeojkppjeojgmnjiicgemlgjlcgkl?authuser=0&hl=en--](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/rate-my-acorn/jiheeojkppjeojgmnjiicgemlgjlcgkl?authuser=0&hl=en--) let me know what you think!

Source code is in chrome web page description.

  
Edit: Do note that for some profs, it wouldn't be able to find them as they're name on acorn might not be the same as on rate my prof.",submission,322
