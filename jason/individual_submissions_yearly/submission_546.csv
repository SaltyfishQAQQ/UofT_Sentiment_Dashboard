U of T mathematics course guide: I analyzed all the prerequisites for U of T mathematics courses,deleted,1dnupvs,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dnupvs/u_of_t_mathematics_course_guide_i_analyzed_all/,1719280766.0,"My inspiration was that there is a nice graph online of prerequisites for Computer Science and Statistics courses already, but none for mathematics courses. This is based on a version I wrote mainly to help myself since the prerequisites on the academic calendar can be hard to read, so it may contain errors.

# Foundations

For first-year calculus / analysis, there are several options:

* MAT133 or (MAT135 and MAT136) - This allows for entry into MAT235 second year
* MAT137 or (MAT135, MAT136, and MAT138) - This allows for entry into MAT237 and MAT235 second year
* MAT157 - This allows for entry into MAT257, MAT237, and MAT235 second year

For introductory linear algebra, there are also several options:

* MAT223 and MAT224 - The standard linear algebra courses
* MAT240 and MAT247 (Requires MAT157 as corequisite) - This allows for entry into MAT257 second year

For second-year calculus / analysis, there are three options:

* MAT235 (Requires MAT133 or (MAT135 and MAT136))
* MAT237 (Requires MAT137 or (MAT135, MAT136, and MAT138))
* MAT257 (Requires MAT157 and MAT247)

Students in MAT235 and MAT237 can also choose to take MAT246 Concepts in Abstract Mathematics which will allow them to take more courses. MAT257 students are not allowed to take MAT246, but they are allowed to take any course that requires it.

On the list below, if a course has a bullet point, it requires the course above it as a prerequisite.

**Note: MAT237 can always be taken instead of MAT235 and MAT257 can always be taken instead of MAT235, MAT237, or MAT246.**

**MAT357 can be taken instead of MAT337, MAT267 can be taken instead of MAT244, MAT351 can be taken instead of APM346, MAT347 can be taken instead of MAT301, and MAT354 can be taken instead of MAT334.**

at least for MAT235 in my experience, its a lot easier than MAT237 both content and averages",comment,2
