They are trespassing. It's private property.

You‚Äôre right, Gaza is no longer the worlds largest open air prison, it‚Äôs become the worlds largest graveyard. although if you‚Äôre interested on why it was previously being referred to as such, please take your time to read the following articles: (Gaza is still considered to be under the Occupied Territories because Israel still employed a Blockade and several restrictions on  who and what goes in and out of Gaza post 2007.)

Before that, the Romans had long eviscerated whatever Jewishness lingered in Palestine following the expulsion. Not to mention DNA data shows Palestinians as being completely indigenous to the land whereas it is illegal for Israelis to do a DNA test, because it just comes back 99% European most of the time lol.

Although I highly disagree with the UN partition plan, Israel did not just stick to the boarders outlined by the plan. It began to settle and occupy territories given to the British Mandate of Palestine. This cannot be denied, if you want to get political many argue that Israel has no established borders either as they occupy territory and conduct regular activities on those territories outside of their UN borders, and it gets even more difficult when you notice Israel does not have a constitution, allowing them to get away with many things in legislation and preventing a system of checks and balances against unprecedented power (such as the Netanyahu governments Likud coalition.) Here are some articles to read about this:

Again, I implore you to do your own research on the topic and be heavily educated on it. Further more, I would like to add that you suggesting TikTok is inherently a ‚Äúbad place of learning‚Äù because of someone with ‚Äúblue hair‚Äù (interesting stereotype to build‚Ä¶) is not entirely true. Many movements, issues, and political topics have been pushed to the forefront of the world because of media like TikTok. It‚Äôs no different than the fear of the press in early modern Europe and the use of it to lead to the decline of said period. Yes, misinformation can spread quickly too but that‚Äôs why you need to do your own research in addition to what you see on the internet. But I‚Äôve seen and heard from many creatives, intellectuals and wise people of all ages and backgrounds from social media and I hope you let go of your biases against the usefulness of it and use its resources to help you maximize your understanding of the world in a quick and informative way. 

Not only am I a history major but I also major in PoliSci, and against the best advice of my professors I‚Äôve written many papers on Indigenous peoples in Canada and Palestinian Peoples in the Occupied Territories. Although I truly hope you are not a history major. This wasn‚Äôt a debate, it‚Äôs just me giving my own 2 cents. :)",comment,2

I‚Äôve held several fundraisers for Palestine and contributed heavily in over $10000 raised and donated over the past 3 years yet now I find it difficult to support Palestine because I have to align myself with these degenerates who have nothing better to do than ruin other people.

A medic tent, a well organized faculty tent, they have Indigenous Peoples who have built a system of justice within the camp as well, teach-ins, important programming and more!

I guess it was the disingenuity and malice of most of these protesters that turned me off to taking these people seriously.

I don‚Äôt necessarily disagree with the efficacy of such protests. It‚Äôs just the bandwagon mentality of the protesters that really gets me angry. They purely think of Palestinians as heroes and Israelis as villains and murderers when the situation is so much more nuanced on both sides.

I disagree with their hatred towards Jews. I truly believe they‚Äôre conflating purist Muslim ideals and the goals of this protest and taking us back several steps rather than allowing for eventual peace. I‚Äôm ambivalent towards the Jewish people but I cannot condone the poor treatment they have received worldwide. I see groups of Muslims ganging up on Jews and only letting them go if they speak against their beliefs. These protesters are more akin to bullies rather than the oppressed who need support. This is not to say the problem faced by Palestine isn‚Äôt real. I just hate that these bastards want to make it about themselves. I‚Äôve even seen them advocating for the removal of cameras from campus. Why would that make anyone feel safer, especially when there is a contingent of purist masked men/women on campus, who can harass and bully with impunity. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they would degrade to robbing people given more time given the newfound power they wield and the requests they‚Äôre making. This is not to insult my muslim brothers and sisters but seriously why tf would you ask for cameras to be removed from campus unless you have criminal intentions. I mean we‚Äôve seen the Stanford prison experiment, we know what these situations do to the people who‚Äôre given power.

And WHY would the university take your requests seriously if you request things like the removal of cameras.

Ps. A question for you, I‚Äôve noticed that students are also breaking in (or refusing to leave from) certain places on campus. Like I saw a video of students trespassing and sleeping in a building and complaining about lights. What‚Äôs the point of this? Or is it just to inconvenience others as much as possible? Because I‚Äôm genuinely confused why they‚Äôre there unless they‚Äôre undercover homeless folk lol.",comment,1
