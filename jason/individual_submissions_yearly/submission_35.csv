For schedules: I always just rebuild my schedule in Smart Timetable (dev is Kravcov Denis, you can get it on Google Play) 

It's pretty good, minimal ads or a really cheap one time payment. Definitely better than some of the others out there I've tried to use, doesn't have all the extra bloat stuff a lot of them get filled with. 

But really any school specific timetable app I find is better than the standard calendar apps and much better than the schedule app schools give you. Plus you get reminders and often can add a widget for the schedule on your phone's home screen.",comment,1

Engineering year statements work differently than ArtSci.

My original cohort were those entering in 2019 who would have graduated in 2023 (2T3) if they just did the academic requirements. +1 because I took an extra year, and then +PEY (another year) because I went through the PEY program.

It's very common for engineers to be YEAR + PEY because almost all of us go on PEY, so we don't use that to refer to the year we graduate. Engineers use this system to describe their cohort and who they ended up graduating/studying with.",comment,7
