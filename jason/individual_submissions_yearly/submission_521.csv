However there was only one calculation question and it was so simple. (0.15*5=?)
And it‚Äôs not a complex calculation required course since everything was almost all remembering and understanding 
TA walked by several times and not stopping them using it
So do we see calculators as aids when there wasn‚Äôt a special claim :p

So what I‚Äôm asking is, if this calculation was hard enough to use calculators then why only they had them and why ta didn‚Äôt stop them. This is unfair to others who struggled with math.

If it was simple so why they even know there would be a calculation prob and bring the calculators. If they were using them for other purposes then and that calculation prob was just a coincidence.

So you can have a Type A (no aids allowed) exam with any type of calculator allowed -it would have to say so on the exam paper though. Type A3 (no aids allowed, you're allowed to use a calculator from the faculty list of approved ones) is the most common type of Type A exam, in my experience.

Even if you don't actually need a calculator, profs tend to allow it to make sure you don't lose points to meaningless calculation errors that don't actually reflect your understanding of the material.

those students could have had accomodations to use a calculator.

or the proctor noticed, recorded evidence and made a note of it. they would share this info with the professor and open an academic misconduct case later. they don't immediately interrupt and confront students, tear up their exam paper etc. because of the possibility they could be wrong and because it would affect the other students in the same room writing

Students with accommodations do not write with the general class because having an aid in a ""no aids allowed"" will disclose that the student has accommodation. This violates Ontario FIPPA legislation on privacy. 

If aid was discovered and it was clear cut (i.e. no aids allowed instead of ""use non-programmable calculator"" and there's debate over whether that calculator model is programmable), the TA or invigilator will remove the aid right away. We will mark the location on the exam where the aid was discovered and allow the student to continue the exam without the aid. Think for a second. If a student was observed using a cell phone or cheat sheet, any invigilator will confiscate it right away.",comment,2
