The crowd has people from many nationalities. I saw Indians, Chinese, White people, Black people, and even a group of Jews of Palestine. There's no struggle, no shuffle, no fighting. The messaging is super clear. Not everyone is allowed in the tents.

This not being peaceful, is entirely a fabrication of UofT. Demands are also very simple. There have been many lies posted by UofT about talks that have never happened. There's no safety concern for Jews, there were Jews in the protest and no one bat a single eyelid.",comment,174

If you want to counter protest choose somewhere else to do it. Unless you're an agitator and then you'll do it close to the original protest to cause problems. And your reason to do this is to shut down the protest because you don't agree with it, which is a violation of rights quite simply.

Yes this is correct. This isn't just a Palestine good, isreal bad point. The context matters and it's good to see you grasping the core concepts!

You are free to counter protest but as soon as you go and clash with another group now you're becoming an agitator. It's very simple that you don't get to interfere with another protest because you don't agree.

That's not the free speech all the free speech people talk about right. 

If your voice is so important, make it heard somewhere else. You are free to protest but you are not free to produce/promote a threatening/violent situation.
