There's a lot of cars passing by but there's also a lot of students trying to walk across the street. So it would be nice to have a mini highway bridge or something ,submission,60

No need for speedy cars when Spadina and the Avenue are just flanking the campus,comment,60

Spadina gets dug up into highway connecting to the originally proposed Allen Way. St. George becomes an underground ramp that resurfaces past Bahen, anywhere from Bahen to Bloor gets no car road, while St George Ramp merge onto Spadina Hwy at AC underground, now students get to workout with a beautiful heavy traffic background.

St George Street, like Huron Street and just about every other roadway on the UofT campus is a city street. It's not UofT property to do with as they please. It's most certainly not the right of every undergraduate to walk anywhere they want to, whenever they want to. Try that shit on Yonge Street sometime and see how far you get. If UofT were to build a bridge of some sort, they would need City permission. If the City of Toronto were to build this bridge, they would need UofT's permission. It would be a clusterfuck of epic proportions.",comment,-5

You dramatically increase the chances of an accident because OTHER people will think it's time for them to cross even though it isn't.

I have seen cars screech to a stop MULTIPLE times because people don't wait for the light and others follow them thinking it's a green light for them, and hence walking Infront of a car they're not looking at",comment,1

You are ignoring the harmful effects of your actions purposefully. 

It's like speeding and hitting someone, then saying that it's the fault of the person you hit because they weren't careful. 

You know herd mentality exists. You know it can lead to a death. So you take that into account with your actions.",comment,-5
