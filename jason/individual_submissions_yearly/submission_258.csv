Job Opportunity Phishing Scam for U of T Students,Adorable-Register-63,1dwpy0o,https://i.redd.it/3rst7fd9kwad1.jpeg,1720273475.0,"I just got an email yesterday from a person with a ‚Äú@mail.utoronto.ca‚Äù in their email address offering me a convenient job. As I was overjoyed and I‚Äôve been wanting to get a job recently I immediately sent my details (which I now regret) without making sure if it was legit. Background: I‚Äôm an immigrant who‚Äôs only been here for only over a year so I‚Äôm still pretty ignorant about this, also given that I haven‚Äôt been sending anyone my email address and I was thinking that most likely only the school would know my email address.

This is most likely to be scam right?  I‚Äôve already reported it. I‚Äôm just scared they might use my details to scam somebody else.

I just wanna post it here in case anyone else is in the same predicament. ",submission,108

so I looked into the email they give. one is sick kids canada. seems ok, but looks wired by ended up with icloud.com. and the second is just some ramdom letters, whitch is more suspecious. 

so I looked up the first email on google and returned nothing, and searched for sick kids's email and their email is end up with "".ca"" that's make sence. 

and finally, I searched the subject of this email on google and that takes me here.

also, I found out some one posted this email on his blog showing it is a scam, link is here: [https://security.uchicago.edu/2024/07/03/email-scam-july-3-2024-uoft-alert-job-opportunity-for-uoft-students/](https://security.uchicago.edu/2024/07/03/email-scam-july-3-2024-uoft-alert-job-opportunity-for-uoft-students/)",comment,2

I don‚Äôt know much about the details being used against you or for some other stuff, but it‚Äôs pretty sensitive information and i also had the same concern where they might register you on stuff or misuse ur identity
