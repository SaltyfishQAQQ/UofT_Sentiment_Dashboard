From my understanding, if we took something like the S&P500, which UofT invests in, divested that and invested in an asset like ""the S&P500 - Israel Companies"", it would be akin to UofT still holding the S&P500 and just shorting the Israeli companies.

Working with this, shorting a stock just means borrowing the stock from another investor in the market and buying it back later to give the borrowed stock back. It wouldn't affect the capital pool or funding that is available to the Israeli companies (This is true when you also buy the stock) because the capital was given to them when these companies IPO'd.

Taking this to a full example, imagine the entire portfolio of UofT was in Israeli stocks and they sold the whole portfolio, the capital available to these companies and the investment into them would still remain exactly the same?

If the goal is signaling and providing out stance, do popular Palestinian organizations short Israeli companies/people with money in solidarity with Palestine?",submission,19

So let me post something from an actual expert:



> Olaf Weber, a professor at the Schulich School of Business and CIBC chair in sustainable finance, said, speaking generally, that there are ways investments can be disclosed without threatening ""competitive advantage.""


> Although he has no direct knowledge of U of T's portfolio, Weber said that if the school asked its account managers to avoid making investments protesters would find objectionable, they would likely do so.


> **There is precedent for something like this, Weber said, citing past pushes to get universities to divest from fossil fuels, something U of T itself has done.**


I think this last point is key - if the UofT says it can’t change how it’s huge endowment fund is invested, how would it ensure it’s invested sustainably (something that’s taught in its own courses)

Ironically:

> Once a year, U of T releases a broad-strokes report on its investments. This does not include the granular detail protesters seek, **but the most recently published edition lists ""human rights"" among its ""top areas of focus.""**

That being said, whatever amount U of T could go short Israeli companies would have no impact on the stocks prices because the fund is only $3B. Any percentage currently allocated to Israeli companies (ex. through an index) is likely to be less than a few million $ (if even that), but even $3B across all Israeli companies weighted by their mkt caps would still be insignificant.

Divesting isn't exactly the same as keeping the current portfolio and adding shorts against israeli companies, since explicitly shorting sends a much stronger message than divesting (even if the combined long/short cancels out any returns). To try your approach, the endowment would need to decrease its current holdings across the board to have some dry powder for shorting israeli companies. They would also need to actively manage the short, since the indexes could change % allocations towards those companies. 

AFAIK endowments can't actually short companies directly, but let's just say they find a fund that exclusively shorts these israeli stocks 1:1 to the amount the school owns in other parts of its portfolio. The fee for this bespoke service of an actively managed fund that likely no other investor would be interested in would be pretty significant, and would probably result in significant recurring costs to the endowment (resulting in greater loss than plain old divestment).

Either way, disclose/divest is ridiculous. The kids on the lawn don't know what they're talking about, hard to believe they were admitted, the school needs to filter better...",comment,7

Divestment has gained remarkable traction in recent years, going from a fringe strategy to a $14.5 trillion movement with over a thousand major investors, pension plans, and endowments committed. Today, as institutional and retail investors pour money into environmentally conscious funds, it is time to consider the financial and social benefits of the movement.

The divestment movement changed the conversation around fossil fuel finance. Investors and banks are increasingly questioning the long-term viability of the entire sector. Divestment seeks to stigmatize fossil fuels and raise uncertainty around their continued use, to reduce the financial desirability of fossil assets. Fossil fuel mining, exploration, and extraction all are capital intensive activities that demand constant access to capital. If capital costs rise or the supply of capital is reduced, projects can become uneconomical and fossil fuel companies can see their valuations fall. This process is well underway in financial markets for the most polluting and least efficient fossil fuel, coal. Even for oil and gas, a study across thirty-three nations indicates that increased divestment pledges are associated with decreased debt and equity capital flows to fossil fuel firms. Unsurprisingly, the effectiveness of divestment is amplified in countries with strong environmental policies and diminished in those that subsidize fossil fuels.

Proponents of divestment may seek to starve fossil fuel producers of capital, but they are also making a savvy business decision. Over the past decade, the fossil fuel supermajors (e.g., Exxon, Chevron, Shell, BP) have tumbled from their perch as the planet’s largest companies. In 2020, Exxon was booted from the Dow. The once mighty energy sector is now the smallest sector in the S&P 500. Since its inception in 2012, the S&P 500’s Fossil Fuel Free Total Return Index has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 overall. As fossil fuel equity prices plummet, holding onto these companies has been value-destroying for many shareholders, leading market commentator Jim Cramer to declare “I’m done with fossil fuel stocks.”

Fossil fuel debt has also proven a risky proposition. The raft of bankruptcies last year among fracking companies (including fracking pioneer Chesapeake Energy) revealed the volatility, capital-intensity, and unsustainability of their business models. Even larger companies are feeling the pain. Exxon, Shell, and Sonoco all saw their credit ratings cut this month.

Fundamentally, fossil fuel companies are valued on their reserves. Climate science tells us that to maintain a safe climate, most of those reserves must remain in the ground. Unexploitable reserves become worthless, stranded assets. Write-down the value of these potentially stranded assets and fossil fuel companies are looking at a grim financial future. Financial institutions can choose divestment to avoid major losses and gain the opportunity to reinvest in more promising industries.

Despite the accelerating growth of the divestment movement, capital has continued flowing into fossil fuels since the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Some might argue that these continued inflows indicate that divestment has not worked. However, considering only immediate financial impacts of divestment misses the wider effects of the movement. An Oxford study made this point, stating, “the most far-reaching threat to fossil fuel companies” comes from increased social and political stigmatization of their activities and the resultant uncertainties around their long-term viability. Within finance, government, and civil society, the divestment movement has forced a fundamental reckoning with the future of the global energy system.

Divestment has its share of critics. Many of them look at the continued financing of fossil fuels and see divestment as a blunt, or perhaps, naïve approach to addressing a complex problem. While the divestment movement alone may not solve the climate crisis, divestment must be considered within the broader ecosystem of climate action. Although it sits at one end of the climate finance spectrum, divestment has shifted the discourse around climate considerations in finance, which empowers other climate actors.

In terms of avoided emissions, the divestment movement’s impact will continue to grow, but it has already succeeded in putting the fossil fuel sector on notice.

1. Many companies pay their executives in stock, so the value of their compensation and holdings drops with the stock price.

2. Many companies are majority or substantial owned by private equity or other institutional investors, who plan to exit them one day with a respectable gain. They will be hurt by a stock price drop. Some of them also borrow money against these holdings and they’ll get margin calls.

3. Many companies need to raise capital from time to time to fund expansion, which they can do from the stock market. But if their share price is down it’ll be that much harder to raise capital.


I’ve shared another comment, but the key takeaway is that divestment ultimately works by creating a stigma around an industry in the longer term. It uses oil and gas as an example but weapons manufacturers are the same. The general public has never been exposed to the horrors of war the way it has in Gaza today, and it’s the biggest negative advertising the weapons manufacturers could get.

There’s a reason why they tell people to invest in ETFs and not individual stocks. ETFs are always the safer option and outperform people who trade individual stocks.",comment,2

Trying to do something will just cost you money and do nothing. By all means, do what you like. But sitting there acting like investing in these funds actually does anything is a fools errand. 

XUSR still holds all kinds of companies that provide services and products to defense companies. It's not like MSFT is the defense industry subcontractor monolith. Close your eyes, point to a stock in XUSR and it will either be directly or indirectly associated with defense contractors. In fact, I did just that, and what do you know:

The point of the margin is to reduce counterparty risk as you have to eventually buy back and return the stock but if you are already covered then there isn’t really this risk. Economically this makes little sense when you can sell but still.",comment,1

I’ll make it real simple. What do you think would happen if you buy all securities in the S&P500 using the same weighting method?",comment,2

Deciding how to allocate my capital is an important action. Buying local makes a difference, even if some of that business's suppliers are shitty. Keeping my savings at a credit union makes a difference, even if some of their borrowers are assholes. Divesting from weapons manufacturers makes a difference, doubly so if I'm reinvesting that capital into community bonds.",comment,1

Your example was the S&P500. It’s a pretty straight forward ETF to replicate. You just need a team, which UofT already does.


Also, do you think UofT hires a Chief Risk Officer and pays them $300k+ just to invest in ETFs? LMAO",comment,3
