I sat on the first floor of robarts and was about to start studying until I looked at the computer and desk. I honestly thought it was a bug because i wasnâ€™t wearing my glasses, then realized it was a clump of hair rolled into a ball with dandruff around itâ€¦Why is there a big clump of hair on the desktop, a bunch of dandruff on the desk, and dried up sauce on the tableðŸ˜­??
