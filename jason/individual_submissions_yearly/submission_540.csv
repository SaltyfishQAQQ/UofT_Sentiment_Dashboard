I‚Äôm not exactly sure why, but I wonder if it could be influenced by the weather. Winter is starting, and the sun is setting earlier and earlier. No matter what time I get up, the day feels like it ends so quickly, and I can‚Äôt help but feel like I haven‚Äôt accomplished enough.

I know life has its ups and downs and that‚Äôs part of its beauty but why does it have to be now? Why do I have to feel this way when I have two term tests and five finals coming up? I‚Äôve been studying hard all semester, and I really don‚Äôt want to mess things up because of this.

Anyway, how‚Äôs everyone else feeling? If anyone has been in a similar situation, how did you handle it?",submission,41

Make the most out of it and embrace the dark. Also, maybe try hanging out with ppl when it gets dark so things dont seem so dull and dead",comment,13

I get all negative thoughts and self-loathing day is over and i haven‚Äôt even started.. my future id doomed‚Ä¶ I really struggle and feel worthless


But since , i started using light therapy, i bought off Walmart something called Happy Light.. maybe $40. i just switch on that and sit nearby facing it and i feel less sad and more positive to get things done. So i go on with my things while keeping the light on during daytime when i start getting self deprecating thoughts!

I also try to do journaling but i am not consistent with it.",comment,3
