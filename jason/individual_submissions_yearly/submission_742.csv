Am I socially doomed?

Pretty much the title. Its my first year, I live on rez. I go to all my classes and I approach people and I would like to think I come across friendly. Ive been so very alone though. Zero parties (even though I want to), no connections that I feel secure in. I want to have ""the college experience"", im an extraverted person and id like to do all the college stuff and go to parties and study with and grab food with friends. how do I get to this point with people? it seems like everyone already has found friends and doesnt want any more. I try to join these groups but it just feels so weird and forced, like im not wanted there. Theres nothing off putting about me hygiene wise or anything like that. I keep seeing posts on here like ""I have no firends and its my 4th year"" or ""Im still so lonely and ive been here for 3 years"" and its scaring me. If i havent made friends by now, am I doomed to be like those people?

U of T is notoriously antisocial. Embrace acquaintances with the time, shaped experience, and consistency model in mind. Eventually those people become friends.",comment,15

Honestly, If you think they don't want you that bcz of low self esteem.Whenever you feel like that just ask yourself ""why would they  won't like you"" 
And believe me you can't fine a single good answer to that question lol
