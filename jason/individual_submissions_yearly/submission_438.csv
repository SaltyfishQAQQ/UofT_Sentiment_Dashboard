3rd Year student here. Ngl, I see a lot of students living their lives, going out, shopping often and everything. How are ya'll affording your lifestyles? For context, I'm a domestic student, living on my own and making 1.5k approx every month and still barely cut every month if it weren't for my savings. I cant ask my parents for money either and everything is getting expensive. I cant get a second job either because this one is 20 hours a week plus I'm taking 4 courses and barely able to study due to burnout and ADHD. I am considering side hustles but again don't know how much that will work. I just want to be able to go out once in a while, buy myself nice things and go around without having to worry so much about money. I already get salt on my wounds seeing peers with rich parents partying and buying whatever tf they want and go to cute cafes while half the time I am constantly worried about money even though I am going out with friends.

  
now for those asking about why am I going out, well I need some time out and also I've lost friends by not going out saving money and stuff like that. Where does my money go you ask? Therapy and dental stuff (even though insurance covers a lil), food, phone bills, rent, groceries, meds, toiletries, travelling to visit parents biweekly and sometimes ubering and going out with friends. 

I wanna know how everyone else is sustaining or holding up and living their life while earning or ideas for side hustles.

If you‚Äôre a domestic student and still struggling while making $1.5k, I assume your parents make too much for you to get considerable student grants and loans.

I don‚Äôt think people‚Äôs insights here would be of much help to you, but the only advice I can give is to get a well-paid seasonal job like tree planting or firefighting. These jobs are incredibly taxing both physically and mentally, but if you‚Äôre able to tough it out until the end, the money is good. 

You can make close to $20k over the spring and summer if you‚Äôre hardworking and in good physical shape.

It‚Äôs not for everyone, but I say give it a shot if you can‚Äôt budget more or get more support from your family.
Best of luck to you.",comment,37

The secret for me is that my job is 100% remote. When I have downtime during my shifts, which to be fair isn‚Äôt often, I use that time to study or do assignments or apply to scholarships. I make CENTS above minimum wage but still manage a strict budget where $500 of EVERY pay goes to the school ($1,000 a month). I also have a meal plan and live on residence which, shockingly, actually helps (at least from my view) because I just pay into the overarching pool of debt I owe to the school instead of having to pay x amount per month. So there‚Äôs some flexibility if I need to reroute money elsewhere. Once I pay off what OSAP didn‚Äôt cover, then that $500/pay will go to the NSLSC loan bc I refuse to do interest lol.

Is it extremely shitty? Yes. 

Is it worth it? No, and I don‚Äôt wish this on anyone. 

Could I pull back a bit? Yeah, but not by much. Even if I did, I‚Äôd just have to pay more in the long run from interest anyways so why not push through while I can. I‚Äôd like to think it‚Äôll be worth it graduating with no debt, but my mental health probably disagrees. 

Keep swimming, friend. We got this.",comment,12
