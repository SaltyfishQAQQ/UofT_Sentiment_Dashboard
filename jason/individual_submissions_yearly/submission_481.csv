my convocation is in the morning so i wanted to take my family out to eat afterwards. i dont go to the utsg campus so i dont really know the area.

do you guys know any halal restaurants that are walking distance from campus? it doesn't need to be fancy or anything, but if it is, that's good too. and i'll eat anything, so it can be any nationality too :)

thanks guys <3

  
EDIT: thank you all for the suggestions!! I think I'll either be going with Lebanese Garden or Amal, but I definitely might hit up the other spots in the summer for something more lowkey :)",submission,47

the owners are super nice, it is quite small however so if your family is big (my family is 6 people and we managed to dine here) it might be a challenge finding tables, but nonetheless the food here is very very good, one of my favs around campus",comment,4
