They made that choice, and if they fail their courses because of it, that's their problem, and nobody else is affected. 

But when you force them to attend class, then *I* have to spend my CSB349 lecture trying to ignore the group of dudes loudly giggling and talking throughout the lecture and complaining about how they don't want to be there but have to stay for the participation quiz at the end. 

I'd rather be in a class with people who are actually interested in learning and have chosen to be there. ",submission,185

Some class lectures are useful and interesting, others just covered what you could easily have absorbed from the textbook or just looking at the slides. Especially if it was a class I had background knowledge of the subject. It's not even that I was necessarily uninterested in the class.

Part of it is just my learning style, and tbh I really would have benefited from the flexibility of not needing to attend all of them for a few bonus %.",comment,17

No professor can give a lecture AND assess how engaged every single student is with the lecture at the same time. Further, the idea that your participation/engagement should look a certain way—including how many lectures you attend—is both inaccurate and ableist. Speaking as someone with health issues, I always have to do mountains of extra work to get my participation grade to be decent because my health causes me to miss multiple lectures per semester, and because my engagement looks like taking notes quietly. If I have to ask a certain number of questions or have a requirement to respond to a prof’s verbal questions I won’t get anything out of the lecture because I’ll be worried about the marking criteria the whole time. 

Participation marks in university are bullshit. Everyone here is a legal adult, we can make our own choices about how to engage with a course. Our quality of work in exams and assessments should be enough to distinguish who is engaged and learning from who is not.",comment,6

Attendance, asking questions, even attending office hours will likely show you are interested and engaged in the course and reflect in your mark. I've even had professors give alternate methods of participation for shy people, stating they could engage in online discussion board posts or email them thoughts about the weekly readings, etc.

Though you've accurately noted why attendance isn't and shouldnt be everything, it's difficult for me to have much sympathy for someone who both doesn't attend class often and chooses not to engage with the material when they are there. There are options. Use them.",comment,0

You obviously didn’t read my full comment. I’ve taken plenty of seminar style classes.

You 100% know that my comment was about larger classes and not small seminar courses—same as this entire post. Even in third and fourth year you may have to take some classes where there are 20-50 students in the class.
