Emergency TA Hiring – Dealing with a Professor's Demands,DrEmilio_Lizardo,1fcqar3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fcqar3/emergency_ta_hiring_dealing_with_a_professors/,1725890859.0,"So last Friday, I was notified of an offer from a department that they wanted to hire me as a TA for an emergency posting after a TA for a course had to drop out. I am a second-year grad student and have never had any TA experience at UofT (did my undergrad here too).

With the emergency hiring though, I've been in contact with the professor and Head TA, and they expect me to start teaching tutorials and being present in lecture starting this week on Thursday and Fridag (second week for the class overall) even though I've not received my official offer letter or signed any contract. Additionally, I don't have access to any course materials like readings or lecture slides, am not in the course Quercus page, and have nor completed any of the TA training that the department rep had said I need to. Basically, I'm completely unprepared to teach, but they expect to begin anyway.

Also, I had already made plans on the lecture and tutorial times (for this week only, not following weeks) and even after shifting stuff around, I cannot make it to the lecture time. When I told the professor about this, he said that I have a ""contractual responsibility"" to his course first, so he wants me to drop that stuff to be there (again, I have not signed or even received a contract).

Any advice for someone in my position? I understand that this is an emergency position and the prof needs someone to fill those tutorial spots, but I'm far from capable of doing that right now and I feel he's being a little ridiculous by insisting I go to his lecture in the first week when I have to figure out how to carve out 180 hours this semester on such short notice.",submission,25

Second, if you sign that contract before getting your DDAH, you are going against the union and can get in trouble, so fair warning. Thirdly (and most importantly), figure out who your union representative is for your department and find them/call them today asap. Break down the whole situation to them and get their advice. Please do this before taking any and all Reddit advice. If you need help figuring out who your rep is, message me and I will help you. 

Until that DDAH is in your portal, you are not required to complete any work whatsoever. If the prof is pressure you, let them know that you understand, but PER UNION RULE, this is the situation, and there’s nothing you can do to control that. If he wants you working, he should make your DDAH, and book an hour long initial meeting with you to go over expectations. If you don’t like what’s on the DDAH, don’t sign it. 

Pleaaaaaase get in touch with your union today. This is an extremely messy situation and that is what they’re there for. They will solve this for you better than anyone else.",comment,61

Since you haven’t signed anything yet it’s a bit weird. If you are concerned about training - I had TAs who are absolutely not supposed to be teaching anyone, it’s just bad.",comment,4

also make sure you have enough hours in your contract to attend lectures! dont attend for free (or do, you can do whatever you want, but i advise not donating time to a large organization such as UofT). its very common for professors here to conveniently demand TAs go to lectures while the TA's contract doesn't have enough hours to do so.

the ball is in your court so its okay to set and maintain your boundaries :) believe in your abilities to teach, you got this!",comment,2

You could try telling the prof what you can actually commit to given the short notice and remind them you haven't signed anything yet. They might just be confused. But, if they respond like the previous one that seems like a red flag to me and a sign of how your term might go.",comment,3

Most TAs I have seen are so not good at it, so not engaging and so disinterested that you can tell they are only there to complete their postgrad. I am not sure why it’s always a requirement because quite clearly some people are just not cut out for it, no matter how hard they try. Forcing people to be TAs doesn’t result in anything good. 
Now, if it’s an emergency situation (on professor’s end), I think you might actually have an upper hand, since he desperately needs you as a TA but you don’t actually need this position (as far as I understand). So you can give him your availability, come up with reasonable accommodations - yet again, it depends on how much you want this job and how much you are willing to sacrifice for it. 
That being said, I am not sure why he is bringing up some “contractual obligations” if no contract has been signed; needless to say, it’s obviously a very douche move on his part (at least based on the info you have provided).",comment,2

You’re looking for unit 1. My advice would be to email Maria Dawson (who will then most likely direct you to your department steward), or even Marie Haines. She was my representative last year and is great, quick to answer questions and help. Now that she’s VP, she may be slower to respond, but I know she’s very helpful so I figured if you don’t get an answer from Dawson, try her. You also could CC the grievance officer, but maybe hold off on that for now. 

Also, if you’re on campus today, see if you can find the names of your department representatives. They’re usually posted on the wall of a graduate area, you can also ask around to other TA’s you know. Your local reps will be quicker to answer and are most often other grad students in your department, so are able to understand with more clarity the situation. 

Before anything tho, send an email to Maria Dawson looking for clarity on who you should reach out to about this issue, and hopefully she send you in the right direction.",comment,13
