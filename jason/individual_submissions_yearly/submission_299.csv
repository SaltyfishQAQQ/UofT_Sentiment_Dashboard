From a theorem proven in class, we have seen that for a linear transformation T:Vâ€”â€”>W to be invertible, dim(V)=dim(W). Clearly, n is not equal to infinity. Hence, this linear transformation is not invertible, and I will never sleep again",comment,1

You could have T: R\^2 -> R\^2 where T(a,b) = (0,0).  That's a linear transformation and the domain dimension equals the codomain dimension but it's very much not invertible...

The previous one's not invertible because it's not onto R\^\\infty, so it's got no chance of being invertible...",comment,1
