Applied Combinatorics.. MIDTERM worth 10% of the final grade.  I had the 3rd highest grade in a class of 45.  I had 50%.  1 person got 66%.  1 person got 100%.  The prof would not adjust the grade and 20 people dropped the course.  Guess the religion to which the professor adhered?

Anyhow I ended up with an 84% in the course.  I crushed the 2nd midterm and the final.  The final was tough.  Only 10 people passed the course.

After that 1st MID TERM i spend 10 straight romantic friday nights with my Applied Combinatorics text book.

oh well.
