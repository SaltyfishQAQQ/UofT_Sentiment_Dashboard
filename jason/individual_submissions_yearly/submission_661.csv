Guide to First Year Engineering at the University of Toronto,MomoMelonLord8,1e0u85b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1e0u85b/guide_to_first_year_engineering_at_the_university/,1720718128.0,"Hey everyone, I just completed my first year in eng and wanted to make a post that I wish I could have come across before starting.

A little background info on me: I was a TrackOne (T1) student coming from your regular Ontario public highschool. We didn't have the option for AP or IB and I haven't had any previous family go to UofT or have any friends going into UofT so everything was completely new for me. I also lived at Chestnut residence which I found helped make friends but wasn't a defining factor in my social life as many of my friends were also commuters (RESPECT TO ALL OF THE COMMUTERS OUT THERE)

Here I'll give you the rundown for the courses I had to take as a T1 (it'll apply to everyone for first semester but will deviate a bit going into second semester: good for anyone in T1, ECE, Mech, and Indy) but lmk if you want me to make a post about the community, res life, or overall advice for getting through first year.

**First Semester**

**APS100:** This is your orientation to engineering course which is a glorified bird course with a couple of assignments. You'll have one lecture per week and a practical. Practicals are the easiest participation marks you'll get so just go and make sure you get marked present. The assignments are mostly written reflections or some sort of reflection about a reading.

Biggest Tip: Dont forget to do assignments because theyre super easy but they are worth a lot and you won't get extensions.

**APS110:** This is basically highschool chem on a bit of a larger level (molecular wise). Scott Ramsay is goated and the kindest soul. I stopped going to his class after reading week because it was the 9 am slot and I preferred sleep but he teaches exactly what is in the textbook (TopHat) he made so I didn't fall behind or anything (ask upper years about some TopHat lifehacks and you'll breeze by).

Biggest Tip: Make flashcards for terminology and concepts at the end of each week and you'll have a pretty sweet study set to go off of when studying for the midterm and the final.

**APS112:** ESP is the biggest hit or miss depending on two factors: your team, and your TA. For me, I had the best team and we all got along pretty well but our TA thought they had the most important job in the world and marked super harshly (in retrospective our stuff wasn't that great in the beginning but compared to other tutorial sections we deserved higher grades). It'll be super subjective based on what the TA wants so don't worry about what profs say in the lectures and just go straight to your TA and figure out what they want. I didn't go to any of these lecture unless it was the week of an assessment and then it was a jeopardy style lecture which helped immensely on the types of questions they were going to ask.

Biggest Tip: Once you have your rough draft book a feedback meeting with your CI (Communications Instructor) to clean up your work and then have another meeting with your TA so that they can give feedback on what theyre searching for. Our main downfall in the beginning was that we didn't book any feedback sessions before submitting and the teaching team ""couldn't see any progress we had made"" so just make sure they can see you're trying and you'll be fine.

**CIV100:** The notorious CIV100. If you've heard the rumblings from upper years you'll hear them say that CIV100 was impossible. Tbh they offered an online version of it (APS160 I believe) in the second week of school because they over filled tutorial sections so I switched to that because I like learning from a textbook more. There were also weekly quizzes which really appealed to me so if you have the option to switch and you're struggling, I totally recommend it. I also failed the midterm pretty badly and clutched up the final once I locked in three days before it and I passed comfortably so don't stress too hard.

Biggest Tip: Do the textbook problems to practice throughout the semester so you have a basic understanding but when studying for the midterm and final don't bother. Just do past tests and even if you're not getting them completely, part marks will save you. Even if you have to fake some numbers just so you can show that you know what to do with the question you'll get the marks for it.

**MAT186:** Okay now this course was the actual death of me. Coming from a highschool that didnt get past quotient rule (or tell us integrals existed) I was lost from the start. If you have the option to take it the summer before you start I would definitely recommend that or just brush up on calculus before you come here. The PCEs were gibberish to me and I could never fully complete an assignment (or even start one tbh). I tried going to the math help centre (TAs were useless) and office hours but even the questions there were confusing me. I got a 30 the first midterm and spent my entire reading week doing all of the recommended textbook problems (Im not even joking, I did every single one) only to get a 35 on the second midterm so I dropped it. I know this sounds scary but trust me you have nothing to worry about because I was just studying completely wrong and didn't get the hang of things until it was too late. Don't bother with the textbook unless you're trying to understand basic concepts and then go straight to the tutorial worksheets because THOSE are gold and will be the level of difficulty you'll see on assessments.

Biggest Tip: Go to the course coordinators lectures and don't bother with the other profs if you're starting to get confused and feel lost. Do the tutorial worksheets when studying and don't bother with the textbook unless you're trying to understand the foundations. If you have questions on assignments go straight to the course coordinator (who made them) and ask your dumbest questions. You'll feel a little stupid but its better than having to drop the course never having asked a question.

**MAT188**: Trippiest class I took all first year, as soon as I got the hang of things we were on a completely different topic. Different profs will teach different methods so find one you like and stick to it, I recommend going to the course coordinator for lectures as theyre the ones making all the assessments. Work together with other people on assignments and you'll be fine. The textbook will be good for extra practice but you'll be so tired from tutorials, webworks, and pces that you wont even care anymore. The webworks will look a little confusing but will save your grade as long as you do them.

Biggest tip: Go to the course coordinator for lectures. Webwork problems (the hard ones) and the harder textbook problems will be enough to get you to pass and some of the pce and tutorial proofs will show up on tests. The assessments will be worded in a way meant to confuse you but if you can get the jist of what they want you to do, jsut do that.

**Second Semester** (I'll try to keep this a bit shorter lol because this is when you'll start to get the hang of things)

**ECE110:** This course will make you want to quit eng all together. I spent countless late nights in the commons until 2-3 in the morning grinding this course only to barely pass the first midterm and fail the second. But there is hope. Do the textbook problems religiously because they pull a lot of their midterm questions from it. I am not a big theory person so I didnt like the first half, but circuits was fun if you got the hang of them early on. Watch NESO ACADEMY on youtube if you ever feel lost he literally saved me.

Biggest Tip: Do textbook problems, watch NESO Academy, and go to the course coordinators lecture (specifically professor liu) he's a little dry but will give you all of the information you need to know and exactly what to study.

**APS112:** Same thing as APS111, really depends on your TA, just make sure youre hitting what they want and that you have a nice final presentation and you'll be fine. Don't worry too much about client meetings and being perfect because its meant as practice for you more than them actually wanting a perfect ready to make product.

Biggest Tip: know what your TA wants

**MIE100:** TBH I had no clue what was going on here because I kept changing which lecture sections I went to. I ended up sticking with sinclaire not because I understood what was going on, but I just wanted to see what his coffee break topic would be each lecture. I was completely lost the entire semester but I did the prep101 for the quiz, midterm, and exam and it saved me. It didn't help a lot for the exam but atp I was so behind I just needed some sort of structure and the part marks saved me.

Biggest Tip: Try prep101 for the quiz and if it helps then get a group of people to go in together to pay for the midterm and exam guide as well. (Also I wouldn't recommend doing prep101 for ece because I had some friends do it and they say it didn't help at all) When studying for the exam, jsut grind past exams and you'll see some patterns within the questions.

**APS105:** LOVE professor Emara she is the sweetest soul who genuinely cares about the success and wellbeing of her students, she rewards you with a duck if you answer a question in class and I was always too scared to answer so I didnt get one and that may be my biggest regret of first year haha. I took the most basic coding class in grade 11 which was just html and css so I was pretty worried for something like C (I also didn't know you could switch to APS106 if you didn't want to pursue ECE after T1 but I'm glad I stayed in it) Just grind the textbook and you'll be fine, I didnt go to class after reading week and would just read ahead on the textbook and I was fine. Don't not submit a lab tho because they start to be worth more and I wish I had completed one rather than laying in bed before reading week. Your tests will be hard but they have the same structure as past ones so as long as you can do those and showcase the way they want you to think about those problems you'll be fine. (the teaching team is the nicest and the TAs are also super helpful for labs/assignments THEY DONT WANT YOU TO FAIL)

Biggest Tip: Grind professor Emaras textbook and the practice problems that are in it (they are previous midterm and exam problems) and dont fall behind after the midterm because the final is solely on the second half of the course. (Give yourself plenty of time to understand linked lists because those were super hard for me to understand until it clicked mid exam)

**MAT187:** I'm sorry I can't say anything about this course since I had to retake MAT186 but my friends say that it was a lighter workload than MAT186 but assignments were pretty hard. I will say that when I took MAT187 this summer I absolutely loved it and Professor Victoria Kerr is my fav prof. She is so organized and makes you feel comfortable enough to ask questions throughout lecture. I understood everything as soon as she taught it and it ended up being my highest mark for all of first year!

Biggest Tip: Work with friends and go to office hours

Overall, when I say if I can do it, then you absolutely can. I contemplated dropping out or transferring at least once a day when things got really hard, but nothing beats the feeling of completing all of the work and passing a course (and telling other people you go to uoft eng...call me vain but you'll understand it). Lean on your friends when things get hard and try to remember that your worth doesn't come from your success (or lack thereof) within this program (this is what I struggled with the most).

Everyone is struggling even if they look like they understand. Fake it till you make it (my motto for second semester). I had so many people coming to me for help because I had my assignments completed early and made it look like I knew what I was doing but I was just faking it until I actually understood (even then I didn't fully understand). Everyone is just trying to get through the year and there will be the select few who breeze by but don't let them make you feel bad about yourself. Wish them well and keep working hard so that you can be like them one day too.

**TLDR: You will make it through.**

PS. If you ever have any worries about your grades or any questions please don't hesitate to message me on here and I am happy to help with anything, even if its personal. We're all in this together and need to support each other when things get hard.",submission,29
