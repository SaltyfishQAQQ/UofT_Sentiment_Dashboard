I started talking to this guy beside me on the first day of my first lecture, turns out we were both in the same major. We both had another cs class together later that day. Sat together again. Met a couple other guys. We all went for lunch and met another cs guy in the line. Today, those 5-6 people are already some of my closest friends (we all booked a flight and went on vacation together this summer lol) 

Also donâ€™t be too worried about being alone, thereâ€™s a lot of students in the same boat as you! Just be open to talk to people even if itâ€™s just simple conversation, you have no idea where itâ€™ll lead :)",comment,51

Is there any way you can attend even part of orientation? If both answers are no, then just like the other commenters, be open to chatting with people. Join clubs and or study groups or intramural sports. You wonâ€™t be the only one looking to make friends.  Most new students donâ€™t know anyone either. Hart House is a great place to hang out and grab food and get involved. This is random but if you play chess there are always people looking to play. Also donâ€™t assume that everyoneâ€™s friend groups are locked in during the first couple weeks of school. While itâ€™s easy meeting folks in the first couple weeks, you can keep meeting people and making friends all four years. And be brave and donâ€™t worry too much about eating alone.",comment,9

In fact I think, ""must be nice to have some peace and quiet, and they're sitting in such a pretty spot. Maybe I'll sit there one day when no one's around"". There are so many parks and empty classrooms or benches that you can sit at, no one bats an eye!

  
I think a lot of people are hard on themselves thinking this is ""awkward"" and looks ""wrong"" and ""people will judge me"" when it comes to walking or sitting alone. Having this mindset makes it easier to compare yourself to others which doesn't make you feel very good and is mentally draining. 

You'll see pretty quick that there are loads of people who walk around or do stuff on their own, look at the subways and people going and leaving restaurants! Don't be hard on yourself OP and don't overthink it. You'll eventually meet some people and maybe an hour or so of your day is ""social"" but its totally okay if the rest of the time you're on your own. What matters is the connections we make that aren't always visible, not the superficial ""school friends"" we make that you stick with 24/7 but don't turn into long-time acquaintances.",comment,3

I enjoyed it because I watched tv shows on my phone, so it wasnâ€™t really surviving since I enjoyed it. The best ways to make friends are in residence or clubs, followed probably by tut or lab sections where they pair you into groups. In class itâ€™s pretty difficult especially if you are introverted, but not impossible (I made one good friend in class).",comment,1

Likewise you can attend clubs relevant to what youâ€™re studying, your interests etc, and should be able to find people that way.

You should also just try talking to people at the start/end of class. Especially in first year since everyone is in the same boat itâ€™s pretty easy to meet people (classes are huge too so you can sample from a large group).Â 

Within the first week or two I made friends that I still have like 6 years later. All was just through a mix of those 3 things, you just need to have the confidence to go up and say hi. Mind you, I have a decent amount of social anxiety so I totally understand how nerve wracking it can be, but I also found that if you just throw yourself into situations and worry about the how of things later itâ€™ll make for much more interesting experiences and a more memorable time at uni.

another thing is consider joining a club!! i have made a lot of great friends like that. itâ€™s easier to open up when you have a shared interest, i feel.

also, take advantage of tutorials!! youâ€™re usually in a much smaller group so you will get the chance to properly interact with other people. 

i also came to canada all by myself as well and trust me you will end up finding friends in due time. just trust the process lol",comment,1

Like what the others said though, you should def check out club fairs and talk with classmates. Joining clubs will help you connect with upperclassmen who may help you find others in your grade / people that youâ€™ll probably vibe with",comment,1
