And why it was implemented? Who decided that? What were some of the thoughts about it when it got started?

It seems like there is no information about the history of it on the Internet so I came here to ask if someone knows.",submission,16

some programs just don't have capacity for everyone who is interested, so they have restrictions on enrollment",comment,28

Applying after 1st year where everyone has been exposed to a more similar level of rigour is more equitable. 

Beyond that it gives students more time and a chance to sample of a variety of courses before categorically having to decide on a major.",comment,19

Non-Honours students didn't *have* any specialization until about 1920, after which they had an open first year and (effectively) minors. Open first year even for Honours (four-year) students began in 1968, but the entire degree structure was more open than now from then until 1981, when the current system (more or less) was put in place. 

**Long answer:**

Source: academic calendars at [https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/archives/online/digitized-publications](https://utarms.library.utoronto.ca/archives/online/digitized-publications)

It's not explicit in the 1860 calendar, but you could be a  ""Candidate for Honors in any department"" or a non-Honors candidate. Pretty much everyone took the same subjects (except for students in medicine, law, civil engineering, and agriculture); Honors candidates had courses that were only for them. Application seems to have been directly into Honors or not.

In 1875 Honors students specialized a lot in 4th year. Named Honors subjects are Classics, Mathematics, Modern Languages, Modern Languages with History, Natural Sciences, and ""Metaphysics, Ethics and Civil Polity"". 

In 1884 women could attend. They're ""Miss"" in the student lists.

It's explicit in 1900 that applying for Honors happened as part of applying for university, either by writing an paper on top of the standard junior (gr. 12) exams or via standard senior (gr. 13) exams. You could start as a general (""Pass"") student then become an Honors student based on grades in 1st-year exams. By 1930, Pass students had to specialize in such a way as to end up with what we'd call multiple minors by the end of 4th year, and Household Science for Pass students had extra requirements.

In 1951 UofT replaced the old ""Pass"" and ""General"" degrees with three-year degrees. Only Honours students now did 4th year. After 1st year, 3-year students narrowed their focus to what we'd see as only two minors. Honours was still direct application at admissions. It looks like transferring into Honours was gone.

In 1961, some Honours programs led to a BSc, instead of all of them leading to a BA. That calendar notes clearly that you *can't* do what we'd call a double major or double degree. 

Then in 1968, UofT started to phase in a very open curriculum, using the term ""programmes of study"" to refer to ways to concentrate your studies. Now students were admitted to the faculty as a whole even if they were going to end up with a four-year Honours degree. All of what we could call specialists and majors were *suggested* programmes of study you could embark on; it sounds like your registrar could approve other options. ""Honours"" now just meant you did one more year of university with a higher average. 

In 1974, the vague programmes of study got focused into Specialists (9+ credits) and what we would call Majors, but which were called Minors (6-8 credits). They were still all optional. 

By the end of the 1970s, I guess the administration had had enough of directionless students . As of 1981, a three-year degree required a Major and a four-year degree required a Specialist or two Majors. There were now also 3-credit Minors.",comment,7

It was so competitive to get in that required minimum first year averages went above 85%. I'm sure we all know how difficult it is to get a 4.0 GPA in first year at U of T.

In some extreme cases students would enroll in a first-year required course, do badly on the very first quiz worth about 10%, and then immediately drop the course to take it the next semester because it would be virtually impossible to do well enough in the rest of the course to make PoSt.

By shifting the burden onto high school applicants the university is able to avoid those kinds of mental health crises happening on campus. Instead all of the stress is borne by people still in high school who will likely have other acceptances to fall back on.",comment,2

That's a very detailed timeline of the history of post and the program requirements! Can I also ask where you got your information for the last paragraph?

And it's not my first time down the UofT calendar rabbit hole, both to look up info about previous courses I actually took and out of curiosity, hence knowing where to start and where in the calendar (generally) to find that info. As a starter, I did know that when my dad applied to UofT, it was directly into an Honours program. On that page I linked, look at both the general UofT calendars at the top and at the Arts and Science section below that. It's a bit of an organizational mess, but \*most\* years for the BA/Arts and Sciences are there between those two. There are also some separate calendars for other faculties.",comment,5
