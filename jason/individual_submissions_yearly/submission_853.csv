CampusOne?? Why? I got admitted into St Michaels College,Used-Yak40,1d9sacs,https://i.redd.it/1onqq3qkh05d1.jpeg,1717705914.0,"Incoming CS first year, Just got this email that I was accepted into CampusOne residence for this year? 
Why did I get this? 
I was accepted for St. Michaels college residence, so shouldn’t I be getting residence offer there? 
I have no idea what’s going on, I didn’t even list CampusOne as my choice for residence, and the main thing is their fees are really expensive, please lmk what I should do, I already emailed them.",submission,19

It's important to note that a lot of the college specific residences are old, and really rather small compared to the number of people admitted for first year.  SMC's residences, for example, can only accommodate like 500 students.  It is entirely possible that your preferred choices were already filled, and because CampusOne is an affiliated residence it is taking the overflow.

I'd reach out to the Housing Service, as they oversee StarRez.  Don't be afraid to pick up the phone and call them if you're looking for a faster answer.",comment,44

2) It's probably because they ran out of spaces for the places you chose. You just got assigned to live at CampusOne because they have empty space.

I'm also an incoming first year so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I'm pretty sure unless another residence offers you a place, CampusOne would be your only choice of on-campus residence. If you can't afford the fees you might need to find somewhere else to live (commute or rent a place nearby). Watch out for their email response first though, maybe you'll find an alternative.",comment,30

If so they’ll dump you in the doldrums and then rob you blind. CampusOne’s rates are downright criminal. I cannot understand how a university as wealthy as uoft has the gall to tell students to pay through the nose like this,comment,4

Most people are engineers and there are some older 2 or 3rd years! It’s what you make of it! The dining hall food could be better but overall the place was clean and you have all the benefits of res while kind of being off campus! I think it’s best of both worlds! In roomate assignment try to find people you will vibe with or are from your program so you can build friendships and socialize as much as you can if you want to!,comment,1

The building I was in had really small rooms, no in-suite bathrooms (so the entire floor had to share 2 stalls) and they didn't let us use the air conditioning after September. The food wasn't that great either and there weren't any shared kitchens on our floors to cook. CampusOne is much better imo",comment,2
