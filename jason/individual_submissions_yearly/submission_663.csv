Iâ€™ve looked through air canada, porter, and flair but they seem to not accept birds. I know that driving is an option but it take over 50h for me to get there which is not very realistic. If there are any bird owners from outside of Ontario, how did you guys manage to bring them in ",submission,28

Depending on how your bird handles care rides though this may or may not be realistic. I had them in a travel cage on the flow of the back seat with a cushion under their cage to reduce vibration and a cover on half of their cage to limit what they could see (apparently seeing the scenery quickly flash by can cause stress and motion sickness).  I had a pick up truck at the time will a full back seat so this also provided a bit more room in the back floor area to put the cage.

I made sure not to leave them in the car without temperature control as well so they came with me to hotels (many hotels will allow you to bring caged birds into the room, but you need to call ahead to verify, at as this was the case in 2012).

I drove about 6-8 hours each day, stopping for food here and there of course, and they seemed to handle it fine.",comment,7
