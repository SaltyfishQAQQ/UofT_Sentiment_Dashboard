In any case, it's not wrong to politely ask to work between someone's sets, or to ask how many sets does one have remaining, that way you could always plan your workout and switch the order of exercises, if you need to!

For strength training, as in increasing max lifts, longer rests periods result in being able to move heavier weight. If you lift 200 pounds 8x4 with 8 minutes rest, you’re going to get bigger than if you did 200 pounds 3-4x4 with shorter rest. The person who lifts with shorter rest periods would have a greater endurance in my experience, but not able to lift larger weight. It’s the same methodology for alternating muscle types. ",comment,5

I usually take about 2-3 minutes for rest, and because there aren’t many machines, people go in between my rests and I go in between theirs. It’s all good

Like middle aged women going to the gym, older guys, cross fit, pretty much any class, smaller guys. Its way more people than you think..

  
You statement is clear you have some bias for your own personal style of lifting, that isnt what general studies are studying. For most people going to the gym there is no difference between resting 45 seconds and 115 seconds in muscle or strength gain as they arent working with anywhere near the intensity that fatigue is a real issue. My point is that 30 seconds has no difference to 2 minutes in lifters. Thats a factual statement. It only becomes untrue if we start adding caveats.

  
Yes 30 seconds isnt enough rest if doing squats at 80 percent plus of your 1rep max if the goal is strength gains. In most people it is though. You arent the main character of the world bro its okay.",comment,1
