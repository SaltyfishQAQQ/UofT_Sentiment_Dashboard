The Prof granted the extension but said ""However, you will receive a significant point deduction in the form of 1-2 letter grades"". 

What is that about? I have doc notes and everything he asked for, and I can't find this policy in syllabus, nor uoft website. Can he actually do that?",submission,16
Grade Deduction after Extension?                          ,cea91197253,lslh92w,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g6r7yd/grade_deduction_after_extension/lslh92w/,1729288870.0,">The following are recognized forms of documentation:

>-- Absence Declaration via ACORN

>-- U of T Verification of Illness or Injury Form (VOI)

>-- College Registrar's letter

>-- Letter of Academic Accommodation from Accessibility Services

>Any one of the above forms of recognized documentation should be considered sufficient on its own when requesting academic consideration. When provided, instructors should not ask for additional documentation or details beyond what is already in these documents.

The above is from the FAS academic handbook. As long as your doctor's note is in the proper format of a VOI, that should be sufficient for consideration. If your doctor's note is not a VOI, and/or does not contain the same information as a VOI, the same guarantee does not automatically apply; get in contact with your registrar in that case.

Two further considerations, since this post doesn't give much context:

1. If it is possible that you did not explicitly ask for an accommodation, and just asked if you could submit late because you were sick, then they may have misunderstood you as just asking to submit late without further accommodation and applied the late penalty. I can say that a lot of the emails I receive do not explicitly request what the students think they're requesting, and I spend a lot of time reading between the lines on students' behalves. Without fuller detail, it's possible that this was mere miscommunication.
2. If your extension request exceeds the duration of a VOI, a late penalty might apply in addition to the extended deadline, not instead of it. But the typical lateness penalty should be included in the syllabus.",comment,17
