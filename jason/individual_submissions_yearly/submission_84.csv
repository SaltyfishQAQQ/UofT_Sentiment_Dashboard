There are also plenty of other laws and papers on this matter that one can easily find, including the multiple geneva conventions that israel has broken in its long list of war crimes amongst other crimes against humanity. Then again, an israeli Ambassador literally brought his mini, dollar store shredder to the UN for his pity party, so I doubt a naive - to be generous with words here -  and uninformed supporter like you would take international law seriously when the people you support act so disgracefully. 

I'm not sure if you have the capacity to read all that, but if you did, then also know that many of the students supporting/leading the encampments are Jewish. Besides this, plenty of Jews are against the state of israel from communities such as the Neturei Karta to organizations such as Jewish voice for peace. Do not hijack the sanctity of the Jewish faith to support the killing of innocent men, women, and children.

Keep reciting your settler colonial dogma all you want. Jews are the indigenous people of Judea. That's how they got their name. The rest are refugees from the Holocaust and the cruel Muslim countries that persecuted them and expelled them in 1948. There has never been a Palestine or Palestinian people.

2nd, Recent genetic studies indicate that the current day Palestinian population is largely descended from the ancient Jewish population in Palestine. they are a Jewish population that converted to Islam, and are now being genocided by a conquering Zionist Jewish population that originated largely from Europe.

And Palestine is a European colonial name from when the Romans stole the land from Jews, massacred and cleansed them from the land, then renamed Judea to Syria-Palestina to remove the Judeans (who Romans called Jews) connection to this land. 

  
If Israel is a settler-colonial project then any Native American reservation is settler colonial too and these natives should just leave and go back to where they came from I guess (wherever that would be but I guess since we have to deny indigenous people the land they come from and their history in it then we can't be saying Native Americans are native to America)",comment,-9
