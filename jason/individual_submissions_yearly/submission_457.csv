How do you politely tell a dude that has been talking to you on ig that you are not into him?,Historical_Task3867,1g336d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g336d5/how_do_you_politely_tell_a_dude_that_has_been/,1728863436.0,"I am pretty sure he wants things to go romantic wise but he never said it. He just keep talking to me on ig despite my intentionally cold reaction. How do I tell him that I'm not interested?

(P.S. we met at a club and had a nice conversation last Tuesday, thought I met a nice club-mate but the dude seems to want more. I don't want things to be embarrassing as I quite enjoy the club but I don't want to keep talking with him either.)

Help? I have no experience with rejecting man excepting faking ""I have a boyfriend"" but I couldn't use it this time.

Update:

I combined suggestions and said something like i dont want to be rude and I want to be abolutely transparent with u that I am just looking to make friend on campus. plus conveyed the idea that I had a date.

Now he said that we could hang out in a totally unromantic manner, just chill and have fun, and said that there is not commitment in the dating phase...

Update 2:

I told him straightforward that I don't want to hang out with him even casually because don't want to make my crush unhappy, he hasn't replied yet, for a day.

I guess that would be it.

Final thing, would it piss him off if I removed him from my follower and unfollow, or should I leave it as the status quo?

  
Update3:

problem solved. He is going into co-op. not gonna see him in a while. don't need to worry about going on embarrassing hiking with him.",submission,52

Like “i appreciate the courage it takes to come forward and say something but while I value this relationship, i just dont feel the same way.” He may never say anything, and if he acts negatively then do you really want to hang around someone who isnt emotionally mature enough to take rejection? I stopped the I dont have a boyfriend excuse and just started saying “No thank you.” And when they say “why?” I say “I dont need to tell you.” EDIT: Dating is hard, finding a partner is hard. You dont have to give up you integrity and make excuses nor should you belittle anyone who proposes a romantic relationship. It takes practice but there is a way to be assertive and respectful.

Infatuations now a days often move on when ignored. Which is different from hot/cold techniques. My advice is to continue on, and stop worrying about it. Address things AS THEY COME UP. If you do it prematurely it can lead them confusing signals, saying that you ‘are seeing someone’ means nothing unless youve been married for 5+ years.

Also you HAVE to be assertive and direct. It sounds like you said maybe, or now’s not a good time. I am in sales and the way I handle these situations is that I mark my calendar and circle back around. You have to tell me to take you off my call list. I would rather you say do not call me then waste my time and just be nice, or hang up. What you are doing is no different. 

If you feel the need to address it now, then you need to be very specific in your wording.

ರ⁠_⁠ರ

Be upfront and be transparent. If you're not interested in him romantically, say it and say why. If you're interested in something more platonic with this person, say that. If you're not interested in them at all, SAY THAT. 
No one deserves to be left in the dark because you're unsure of how you feel about them at that time; be direct and be kind with your approach and in most cases, the message will be loud, clear and received. 

""Hey, I know we've been talking for a little while and I've genuinely been having a lot of fun! But unfortunately I don't think this is going to work out romantically between us right now. I'm totally open to just being friends cause we got a good thing vibing on that front and I don't want to lose a friend because of conflicting interests, you know? Please let me know if you're open to that, and we can take it from there""

(Note, only say the last bit if you really are open to platonic friendship. If that's not in your best interest, then you need to communicate that and then remove yourself from the situation altogether).",comment,2

This doesnt work for everyone, and it really isnt as nice as you think it is-especially if they find out you are lying. I have hung out with the freeks and geeks crowd my whole life but I am also considered to be traditionally attractive and diversly social.
 Being upfront about valuing someone for their social connection and intelligence and not for the potential of a romantic relationship avoids akward situations in the future and generally nutures mutual respect. You are going to lose people along the way but the more you pull reality and logic into the conversation the faster they can make a decision and move on. 

I put forward the same respect to everyone. I expect that every person is mature enough to have this conversation, and if they dont then we can address it as it comes. Until then I stopped maling assumptions of what people can and cannot handle.",comment,6

How do you politely tell a dude that has been talking to you on ig that you are not into him?,deleted,lru2d6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g336d5/how_do_you_politely_tell_a_dude_that_has_been/lru2d6n/,1728882534.0,"Now he's being rude.


""I'm not interested in that.""


Simple as that. If he keeps pushing, ignore his texts. 


Let him be weird if he wants to try and make it weird in person. You can still enjoy the club without bending over backwards to accommodate a man who is trying to trample all over your kindly worded ""No"".


Act unbothered until you don't have to act. 


Learning that situations are generally as awkward as we let them be is an important life skill. ",comment,10

You already gave him an answer and he's just asking for it. I think 99% of guys would agree. Ghosting is shitty after a date or something, not when you can't take a rejection.",comment,5
