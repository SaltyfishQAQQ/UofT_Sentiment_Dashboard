Course enrollment has been a nightmare for me and many other students because Acorn just won't load. As a result, I'm waitlisted for some of the courses I need. Please, please, please, if you're reading this and are currently enrolled in a course you're planning to drop, do so ASAP ðŸ¥¹. It's not just for me, but also for others who are desperate to take the course.

Especially if you're in EEB225, EEB380, or EEB384, since I'm waitlisted for those, lol.",submission,74
