It is not exclusively a Toronto problem. While it may not be pleasant to deal with, sticking your head in the sand and pretending it doesn't exist or insulating yourself in a gated community is not a practical approach to life. Addiction/homelessness/mental health issues are an ever increasing fact of life. If you don't like it, then use your voice by voting for politicians who are committed to finding solutions.

While it may be hard to imagine, that could be you one day. Try showing a bit of compassion.",comment,111

You are allowed to express your feelings.  I too feel unsafe and Iâ€™m a man.  Ppl with mental health issues shouldnâ€™t be running around loose bc they can have a psychotic breakdown at any moment.  Sorry to say this but I think they should be institutionalized against their will.  They are sick and canâ€™t make safe decisions for themselves.,comment,24

If youâ€™re going to school in Toronto- the largest city in the country- expect to see homelessness. This post is honestly so tone deaf, and although I agree it can be scary to see/be approached by men when youâ€™re alone, especially those seemingly on drugs when youâ€™re not sure what theyâ€™re going to do- majority of the time youâ€™ll be fine and Iâ€™m honestly surprised you are so shocked to see homeless people going to a school in Toronto- if it bothers you so much do something productive about it like educate yourself. Thereâ€™s tons of classes at u of t that cover homelessness and explore its root causes such as a failing mental health system in the city and lack of affordable housing. I recommend URB 337 it is a course which specifically covers homelessness in Toronto. I would also recommend watching livestreams or going in person to city council meetings on housing- itâ€™s a great way to understand the issues the city faces and understand current policy and how it can be changed to better support vulnerable populations. If thatâ€™s not your vibe then switch schools kuz you go to a city school and cityâ€™s have homeless people (unfortunately- wish the issues could be fixed for all)",comment,1

the thing about rehab or shelter sites are that they are severely underfunded (extremely incredibly underfunded) and understaffed and not even remotely adequate to supporting and providing reliable sources for the folks that might need them.
In fact with this city's (and Toronto isn't the only oneâ€” far from it) hostile architecture, and constant and consistentâ€” and very intentionalâ€” destruction of unhoused folks' tents and camps, the TTC stations and such are among the handful non-freezing places that are accessible. Additionally, regarding rehabs and such- there are barely any places available that accept folks without placing folks under mountains of debt.
