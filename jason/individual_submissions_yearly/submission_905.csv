What is the chance of getting into UofT grad school with Extremely LOW CGPA?,3-STRIKES,1hhl29h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hhl29h/what_is_the_chance_of_getting_into_uoft_grad/,1734583492.0,"Just like the title. I am a 3rd year student doing physics at uoft.  I messed up my year 1 so badly and fail a year long course(almost got the probation) and year 2 was still terrible because I really canâ€™t keep up with the studies so my cgpa end up with 2.65ish. 

I am now working towards Mec Eng (MASc/MEng) if I could got into this program for graduate. On the uoft website, it says like 3.0/4.0 is needed for last two years of studies, but achieving this doesnâ€™t mean we can 100% get into it. 

I am wondering about the chance of low cgpa and gpa for getting into Mechanical Engineering program for grad. And maybe UTIAS as wellðŸ˜­.


If you think itâ€™s impossible to get into uoft for this program, what about uwaterloo, ualberta, ucarleton, uottawa, Queenâ€™s, and McMasterðŸ˜­ (didnâ€™t mention McGill is because it is way too hard for me)

I am trying to get high gpa this year, but many thing just didnâ€™t work in the way that I want it to be, not just the grades, family and finance are alsoðŸ˜­. Now I get why people said third year is the hardest year out of the uni. 

Sorry for a long text but thanks for read through here, Iâ€™m just a bit anxious for all these things.

Thanks to everyone who read this post and the comments/advices


Please donâ€™t re-post this post on any other social media, thanks (not a weird request, Iâ€™ve seen people do) :)",submission,16

I also got offers from queens, guelph, and mcmaster. Other than my cgpa, the rest of my application was stacked with conference presentations, publications, experience, strong references, and my gpa last 2 years was >3.5. At some point, your gpa becomes irrelevant compared to the rest of your CV. You just have to meet the minimum gpa to get in.",comment,5

Not to be an ass, but it gets harder the higher up you go - not easier. If youâ€™re having serious trouble keeping up in undergrad then maybe a path with a masters degree in your discipline isnâ€™t the best choice for you. Maybe another discipline would be better. Maybe you should reconsider the path altogether. Either way, a step back for reflection is in order.",comment,22

Year 1 is not conceptually difficult but they throw a shocking amount at you and it can be difficult to keep up.
