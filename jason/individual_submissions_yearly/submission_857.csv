Students with a 3.9-4.0, you’re exceptional clearly. You must be doing something right, spill it. How do I take my already great GPA to be as exceptional as you? 💪💪",submission,19

What I am about to say here might be not as applicable if you’re doing a humanities degree, but I would say that if you’re doing a STEM degree, the biggest thing is to figure out how you learn information best, which essentially boils down to maximizing your knowledge and mastery over the subject in the least amount of time possible. 

For example, I find that I am a person who has a really hard time absorbing and understanding knowledge when it is forcefully delivered on to me in a pace not of my own choosing, and that I learn much better when I can absorb knowledge at my own pace and practice alongside my learning. Consequently, lectures were very wasteful to me time wise as I found myself having to go over the very same concepts again myself when trying to apply them when applying them to assignments and problem sets. As a result, I spent almost all of my time at the library studying and not going to lectures for weeks or even months on end. 

Of course, everything depends on how you learn best, and I feel that most people would prefer to go to lectures rather than do what I do. But the point is that figuring out the most time efficient method for you to learn something is extremely important in a stem degree. 

The second most important thing I would say is to maximize your focus and efforts on things that take up the most of your grade, even if it is something from a course you hate. This is a no brainer when said out loud but it can be very easy to wrongly focus your time on some more interesting but grade-wise relatively inconsequential projects and assignments and end up not having enough time to focus on more important ones.

Third thing is to make lots of friends in your program and know (approximately) their academic prowess. Ask from friends who tend to know a lot more than you, and just as importantly, try to teach friends who tend to do not as well as you do. Teaching someone is the best way to ensure you have a solid understanding on the subject.

Finally, realize that GPA is not the be all and end all of your life. Particularly in CS/Engineering related fields, someone with your current GPA is as likely to become successful as someone with my GPA. There’s a lot more things to success than just grades. Despite all that I just said above, trying to maximize your GPA can be a very miserable experience at this university, and often it is better to know that you’ve done your best to a reasonable extent, rather than to force yourself and destroy your mental and physical health for some stupid gradesmaxxing grindset.",comment,22

I feel like for each class it comes down to the little things personally. Making your professors and TAs know you, asking for clarification, utilizing all participation marks, taking bird courses that you know you can get 90%+ in, independent courses also help if your program allows that option.

"How to take a 3•75 GPA to a 3•9+, what am I missing? ",SM0K1NP0T,l5ar619,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cyb9li/how_to_take_a_375_gpa_to_a_39_what_am_i_missing/l5ar619/,1716455753.0,"Just finished 3rd year with a 3.91 cGPA (for reference I am doing the Math applications in econ & finance spec). 

Your GPA is already quite high so I'm assuming you already know about the importance of consistent studying outside the classroom. What will determine whether the jump is made to 3.9+ is how you tackle your weaker subjects. Realistically, you can't get any B+'s from here on out since they will ensure a 3.9+ sGPA is mathematically impossible. This means that you need to really prioritize your weakest courses. It also means you should be strategic with when you take certain courses (if you get the choice ofcourse). If you are currently in a course where you just don't like the organization/teaching style of the prof for e.g., then it may be worth taking it at a later date with a different prof to avoid sabotaging your grades. Don't feel pressured to stick everything through if you don't need to. 


Another thing is practice. This will primarily apply if you're doing/are doing STEM courses. Whenever possible, spam past papers whilst sinultaneously ensuring you learn from your mistakes with each paper. This means how you take your notes are also very important to ensure you genuinely understand whatever is going on in your class. I personally study by taking down notes directly from the textbook and/or lecture slides (whichever I am given and whichever is most useful) but making sure that I genuinely comprehend everything I write down. If something takes a while to click and I eventually get it, I'll make sure to write down the the thought process/information that led me to understand it in the moment so that the next time I revisit that content I understand it again.


When it comes to how much I study, I tend to do 3-4 hours of revision a day outside of classes and tutorials. Ofcourse the hours will depend on how hectic a partilar week is (midterm season might see me average 5-6 hours a day, finals can go anywhere from 8-10 a few days before crucial exams, but less hectic weeks can be as low as 2), but the hours tend to average about 3-4 by the end of the semester. I'm not necessarily encouraging a specific number of hours but this is the sweet spot I've personally found that will generally ensure I get everything done on time and also prepares me enough for exams. 


You may also benefit from trying out new study methods. I personally use the pomodoro method which works by having you work uninterrupted for 25 mins then taking a 5 min break (I typically do a 50-10 split). Helps me stay studying for extended periods of time without burnout. I also use this to help me dedicate certain amounts of time to different courses/tasks so that I don't unintentionally end up spending the whole day on one thing without progress.


Lastly, make sure you take full advantage of the resources you're given. Office hours, tutorials, whichever it is, make sure you use them to their full extent. If for whatever reason you're struggling to push for an A in a course, go out of your way to attend these and get the help needed to cement your understanding of the material you struggle with. On top of that, make use of your fellow students. Find likeminded individuals in your courses and work/study together whenever you can. I can't tell you how much studying with friends has helped me so far. It's always good to get a second set of eyes when tackling a problem for the first time. Bonus points if your friend/classmate is very good at the subject material since they can help you out whenever you're stuck.


Overall, you're almost at the threshold. You've just gotta fill in the remaining small gaps and you're all set",comment,5

Who your prof is might make a big difference too.

But some general tips I can think of:
- If possible, choose courses whose evaluations match your strengths (I.e., are you better at projects, essay writing, or tests?)
- Use office hours a lot and shamelessly ask questions to verify everything. Your prof (or TA) has full power over your marks. In courses with writing, I found it better/safer to regurgitate things they’ve said or confirmed instead of writing ideas of my own…
- don’t take on more you can handle so you can perform excellent in every course? Take a lighter course load if you need to, it’s better for your mental health too",comment,2

If you’re applying to grad school or something, they will usually only take your last 30 or 60 credits, depending on the program, so you can absolutely still get a 4.0 (so far as the grad school is concerned) so long as your last 10-20 classes are that good.

Also, honestly just try to figure out how you study best, as the answer to this question is very personal. Your grades are very good right now, so your weaknesses aren’t going to be super obvious compared to someone stuck at a 2.0, hence why you thing there’s some kind of trick. You should ask your professors for feedback if they aren’t giving it, and give yourself some time to go through old assignments/tests to see where it’s weak. If you see something that the professor marked poorly, but you still though it was good, you’ll just have to raise your standards on that type of assignment/test. Though there is 100% luck involved and professors will vary in their own standards. I prefer taking classes with the same professors, even if they’re a “hard marker”, because I know how to cater an assignment towards them.",comment,1
