how seriously does this school take mental health??,inconspicuousjinx,1hao1sk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hao1sk/how_seriously_does_this_school_take_mental_health/,1733787921.0,"im being serious here…i know theres jokes about how the school doesnt care about students well being but i mean how much consideration do you think is really possible for severe mental health decline? going into exam season, i am relapsing hard in my eating disorder and depression and not to be grim but its hard to care about my grades when i am ready to off myself this instant. is requesting exam deferral (i can get paperwork filled out by my therapist) possible?

people like to respond with things like ‘you just have to work hard like everyone else’ and ‘stop complaining and go study’ but im being treated for my conditions and genuinely am unable to take care of myself at all at the moment so its not as if im putting off my studies to slack off",submission,48

Get a VOI filled out and petition to defer the exams. Contact your registrar for tips on how to write your personal statement. 

Are you registered with accessibility services? That would be the next step, in terms of providing additional support beyond exam season. 

Take care of yourself, OP.",comment,34

Your dealing with a serious mental health issue and the stress is triggering it. If you need immediate help I encourage you to go to the nearest hospital and get crisis support.

You can use the gym facilities and get your dopamine up with some exercise.  There's like 50,000 students, you could talk to a different person EACH DAY And still not speak with everyone. You'll really hit it off with some, and not so with others. School is only tough if you set it up that way. For example, you can get rid of one or more credits each year. You could make up in the summers to graduate with friends, or even just delay your graduation. It's not the end of the world. I had a girlfriend delay her grad by a year, and she made a lot of friends in younger years also.",comment,2

They are very helpful with deferring exams. I am not sure if you can register with accessibility services right now (just because it’s this time of the semester) but you can most likely register for it next semester since they help a lot of students. You can also reach out to Health and Wellness, I know people don’t always have the best experience with them, and it is a hit or miss but I did get help from them and my experience was good (just had one really bad counsellor but you can always ask for someone else or get their help finding another institution to help you). You got this OP, I hope this time eases up for you :)",comment,1

Professors? Depends on the prof; some focus entirely on teaching, but others are available to talk. Typically, I'd go to a mental health professional instead of a prof, but there's certainly no harm in exploring options with them if the issues pertain to their class -- and if they're a trusted figure to you, don't hesitate to reach out.

Students? They may be competitive with their GPAs or networking and might subscribe to the stigma of mental health troubles as a sign of ""weakness"", or simply come from cultures where mental health is treated differently than it may be treated in your experience, but others are open to talk about it or even have work-study positions/majors that see them involved in the mental health field (like me!). You'll find your own group, organically through your classes and/or by attending workshops and events related to mental health. (Example: there are lots of workshops held by individual colleges and student unions to promote wellness, as well as therapy groups such as grief support that meet on a regular basis.) Keep in mind that a lot of these are student-run, and while some of them may have had training in certain areas, they aren't equipped as health professionals. (I have a certificate in suicide awareness, but I haven't been trained in actually talking someone down from suicide. I know who to send them to, but if someone were to approach me at and event and express their problems to me, I'll probably send them off to someone else.)

The university itself? Your financial advisor may not know where to go, but your registrar will. Your college's wellness team will. If you have accommodations, your accommodations representative will also have resources. As has already been said in previous comments, you do need to self-advocate. They can help you way-find and point you in the right direction, and some will be able to explore different solutions with you, but for the most part it's wise to go into a meeting with these people knowing what you'd like to explore or what you want (i.e. ""I need a registered therapist"" or ""I need information on taking a leave of absence for mental health reasons"" or ""Are there groups, websites, or other resources to help me cope with depression and time management?""). You may be passed around a little (""I'm not the best person to talk to about this. But I know who is! Let me give you their email and you can make an appointment.""), but it's usually worth the wait.

In my experience, I've had it both ways. It's all about finding people whose job it is to help you in that area (example: the TA will be able to help you with extensions and the college wellness advisor will be able to help you find college-based events regarding anxiety, but probably not the other way around) and knowing what to ask for. Some people will be able to help you narrow down what you need, if you're not sure. But there are absolutely some people who don't want to support you or aren't equipped to do so. It's a university, not a hospital, you know? Mental health isn't always everyone's first priority. But for some people, like accommodations reps or wellness advisors, it is (or should be), and those are the people you need to seek out. They'll take it seriously.",comment,1
