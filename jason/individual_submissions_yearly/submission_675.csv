Not sure what software you used for making this, but it looks quite aesthetically pleasing. I must put my 2 cents though since I think you are sorta asking for feedback.  
  
1. **Course Time remembrance.** I do see that you have placed ‚Äúnoon‚Äù on the side of the tables to give an approximate idea of when your classes are, but with all due respect, it doesn‚Äôt seem to be a viable way for classes. Marking classes with a easily check-able time frame is quite important when it comes to courses. Approximations based on image and how far courses are from ‚ÄúNoon‚Äù might be feasible, but you can‚Äôt rule out the possibility of error(if you keep checking acorn or quercus for courses after you make a schedule, your schedule is a flop)¬†

2. **Aesthetics vs Practicality.** Aesthetics is quite important when making a schedule unlike what others would say. You are more likely to look at something that looks more pleasing to the eye, than something stale. But a schedule must also be able to give you the information of courses directly in a fast manner. Usage of colours is fine, since you can keep the courses separated, but using symbols which then link to a course code, is a bit of a hassle, something that I don‚Äôt think is an efficient luxury for a timetable.¬†

3. **Flexibility.** One of the key proponents of having a schedule would be making it universal. Sure, you don‚Äôt want to cram all your schedules into one place, but having a way to look at everything through one schedule is quite important. If you have a time table like this, chances are, you are more or less not likely to add additional notes to self regarding other important times. For example, let‚Äôs just say you wanted to add an archery meet-up at HART. It‚Äôs from 9\~10 AM on Wednesday, so you want to make sure you go there on time. If you have a schedule that is flexible, you can easily create another tab(or space) and add Archery meet-up 9-10, which would be integrated to the timetable.¬†

I just want to say that at the end, it is **your** schedule, so your call, but these are just what I think should be resolved in the time-table that you provided. P.S. (Please you MON, TUE, WED, THUR, FRI instead of Day 1,2,3,4,5‚Ä¶ :cri:)",comment,3

also this is just the graphic I made myself in good old microsoft excel, which in itself is very flexible in itself so if I want to add weekly events I can do so there. I have a separate google calendar where I can add any other things I may be doing week to week that are not school related or as regular and that is what I plan to use predominantly, I just made a graphic to better lay out what I'm going into and be able to share it with others in a much more visually appealing (see the other graphic) way.",comment,0
