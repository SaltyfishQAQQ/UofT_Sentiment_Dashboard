fun infasructure idea for SG campus :::::::::::::::::::::,vityism,1f22gzh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f22gzh/fun_infasructure_idea_for_sg_campus/,1724714729.0,"U of T should install firepoles/slides for people (those willing) to move between floors of the newer/taller buildings (Bahen, Myhall, Robarts, etc).

Keep in mind that the University of Munich already has buildings with slides for the same purpose, so this is clearly possible.

This would make going down floors and exiting buildings much faster. This would benefit everyone, even if you don't use the slides/poles, since fewer people will use the elevators/stairs to go down. (i.e after reaching the top, elevators can head down with minimal stopping, so faster ""cycles"")

Also, it's actually pretty easy to control your speed going down a firepole (try it sometime)

Finally, these would be super fun to use so I would be 100% on board if some of my tuition went to this.

**Disclaimer, those who can't or aren't comfortable using the slides/poles can still use elevators and stairs.**",submission,28
