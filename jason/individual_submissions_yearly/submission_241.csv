Definition is simply too broad, but only because the Israeli propaganda mill wants to conflate Israel with Judaism so that any criticism on Israel is considered antisemitism.

I completely agree with that. And I think that people are correct to see these scenes and care deeply about what's happening. There's no denying that this is an enormous tragedy. But what I also see is that they fall prey to the narratives pushed by Iranian propagandists, and are failing to see the bigger picture. Purposefully ignoring context, promoting ahistorical nonsense, and outright misinformation. All so they can relax into deeply lazy, uncurious thought patterns in order to demonize one party and romanticize the other.

>it is undeniable that the Israeli gov’t’s disregard for civilian safety created this situation.

The Israeli government didn't choose to spend billions of dollars of humanitarian aid to design a battlefield underneath and inside civilian homes. The tunnel network under Gaza is the size of the London tube system, and not a single civilian is allowed to enter it. The Israeli government didn't decide to perform a medieval style raid on unsuspecting Jewish towns outside Gaza, perform unspeakable intimately brutal acts on families complete with gang rapes and carefully burning people alive, and abduct babies from their cribs for ransom, and then decide to use those tunnels to shield themselves from any consequences, using the civilians above as human shields. That was all Hamas. 

Meanwhile, Israel subsidizes and makes it a legal requirement for every home to be equipped with a bomb shelter, and clearly marks and separates their military assets from civilian infrastructure. And that's not touching the unprecedented measures of life preservation tactics they're using in Gaza in their campaign against Hamas.

No, it's not Israel who doesn't care about civilian safety.

>Israeli propaganda mill wants to conflate Israel with Judaism

Excuse me? Conflate Israel with Judaism? Israel is the center of Jewish life and contains half the world's Jews. Most of Jewish history occurred there. It's the only country in the world where the population of Jews is above 2%.

This is like saying ""the Japanese propaganda mill wants to conflate the state of Japan with Japanese culture"".

Like, no shit. That's the entire point of Israel. To be the Jewish country.

So basically your position is:

You can't criticise Israel, because it might sound like something someone racist said, and as such somebody might interpret it as an attack against all Jews, but at the same time Israel doesn't represent all Jews? I mean... What exactly would you consider to be ""representing all Jews"" then? You should really not contradict yourself in subsequent sentences.

The fact that some people may use this avenue to be racist does not invalidate that many, many people have extreme concerns about the way Israel is pursuing this war, and the constant chain of escalation.

> As for your dishonest attempt to equivocate Israel defending itself against ethnic cleansing and genocide to South African apartheid, that’s an example of why anti-Zionism is antisemitism. Because you think Jews defending themselves is just as bad as apartheid.

Defence generally doesn't involve conquering land and attacking other sovereign nations, even when you consider them to be terrorists. This is not ""defending"" this is ""engaging in an offensive war."" Israel is waging war on multiple entities that have threatened it. That is the factual description of what is happening.

Sure, you may believe it's a justified war, but many, many other people do not. Attempting to silence them is the thing that truly breeds antisemitism. Nothing pisses people off more than a group of people going, ""No, you can not talk negatively about any of us no matter what they do, because then we'll interpret it as an attack on all of us."" Especially when this is all done at the political level, and results in rules and laws that affect us all.

It's not like people stop holding these views, they just stop discussing them in public where someone might notice they're becoming more and more extreme. In turn they fall deeper and deeper into the pit of those that are willing to cover these topics. In other words, this idea that criticising Israel in open is forbidden, because even though it doesn't ""represent all Jews"" it's still something that seems to trigger an intense response every time it happens; that's the very thing that sends people down the very road you're whining about.",comment,4

>Human Rights Organizations are the furthest thing away from the political right you can find lol

If they're demeaning and abusing the term apartheid by comparing it to Israel taking rational, sensible steps to protect its people, then they are not actually human rights organizations.

Apartheid was a real atrocity that actually happened to lots of innocent people. A nation following its obligations under international law to protect its civilian population is not that at all. If we allow apartheid to be diluted, we give the right a wide berth to other human rights abuses. If Israel defending its own civilians can be manipulated into apartheid, what can't?

>Moreover, the war crimes go beyond this disregard for civilian and children lives.

Yes, Hamas' war crimes do go beyond that. Recruiting child soldiers, perfidy, the abuse of the red crescent.

>They have killed journalists who were with their families in designated safe zones, for example.

Hamas have also killed journalists for broadcasting the truth about the conflict, regardless if they were in designated safe zones.

>They have also restricted access to food and other essentials.

Yeah, Hamas did that by stealing food aid that entered through the crossings. There's footage of that food aid being sold at the Rafah market.

>If you knew all of this and you condone it, shame on you.

It’s clear to me that you just hand waved away those accusations without actually _reading_ them or considering them having any credit.
