Why do instructors feel the need to 'innovate' how math is taught?

Working on assignments with people is already a nightmare, so much so that I just do the work alone. Being FORCED TO WORK WITH RANDOM PEOPLE ON A MIDTERM IS INSANE.

THE LAST THING I WANT TO DO ON A MIDTERM IS COMMUNICATE WITH SOME RANDO ON A FKING EXCEL DOCUMENT. PLEASE JUST LET MATH COURSES BE MATH COURSES.",submission,156

I, myself, participated in such a study being done at UBC.

You also probably have many real examples of how math could be taught badly. Why not be thankful you have the good version?

You shouldn't be afraid of a little social collaboration. Particularly if you already know the answers, then all you have to do is share with the others what it is. And if you don't, then it would give a net-boost to your grade as the others bring your average up.   
  
Nearly zero percent of the time does a student do worse on the group test than their own individual, so it basically always boosts your grade in the end compared to what you'd get otherwise.",comment,-4
