Do you regret/grateful for taking some Bird courses?,2DTurbulence,1domaft,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1domaft/do_you_regretgrateful_for_taking_some_bird_courses/,1719364484.0,"There seems to be a huge number of posts asking for Bird-courses, i.e. at least for now I will define them as courses with : a)low workload and b)easy mark.

So I am just curious from senior or graduating students that took Bird courses,

* whether they were worth taking or did you regret it?
* Did they expose you to new topics that influenced your career path?
* Did they benefit your specific skills/career?
* Was it just a GPA-booster and you didn't benefit skillwise? Would you have preferred a course that challenged you skillwise even at the cost of a lower grade?",submission,21

It was totally worth it, especially since this course costed me $1600 I wasn’t going to take a random throwaway course. I always suggest taking birds that somewhat interest you/may be good information. 

This one is specific taught a lot about stocks/options and accounting. Good business information that everyone should have, it helps you carry yourself in different settings. As a result, yeah, now I know how to properly make investments/evaluate choices, and read financial statements. Pluses all around. 

Likely will be ending the course with an A or A- and wasn’t very difficult. No regrets.",comment,14

Also, I never knew I was so into philosophy until I actually took 113, and now it's become my second major so there's that. That said, I think there's a misconception with bird courses. They're not in actuality easy 4.0s (at least not the ones I've taken). You actually have to work for it, but the ""birdiness"" comes from you actually being rewarded for your work.",comment,6

a group of people I would sit with ALL dropped out. I was on the fence of dropping out but stuck through it. By some miracle, I passed

it was worth it as I needed a 0.5 credit in either mat135/6, phy131/2, or csc108. however I was better off choosing mat135 cause I atleast had a foundation there.

didn’t really expose me to new topics and actually made me avoid anything with coding in general.

   * I dont regret it. Most of the ""bird"" ish courses I took that are entirely not relevant to my major are in fields that I am interested in. In some sense, they are the ""3rd / 4th major option"" to me. They just didnt fit in the top 2 and therefore werent what I eventually pursue.
* Did they expose you to new topics that influenced your career path?
   * Not really, they were not too relevant to my career path, but I am definitely interested in those topics. I figured if I have to take courses to satisfy the graduation requirement, I might as well pick them based on what I am interested in.
* Did they benefit your specific skills/career?
   * Maybe. Some courses definitely opened my view on certain topics. 
* Was it just a GPA-booster and you didn't benefit skillwise? Would you have preferred a course that challenged you skillwise even at the cost of a lower grade?
   * Nah. Most of those courses on top of being a GPA booster, was also fairly interesting topics to me. I feel like I learnt a lot.

My personal opinion on this is that you should not pick bird courses simply because you think it is a free 4.0. At the end of the day, GPA is not everything and taking courses where you dont learn much is not a good use of time or money. I would suggest taking courses you are interested in and/or think is useful. At the end of the day, there is always the CR/NCR option if things dont go too smoothly for these electives.",comment,1

It went well enough that I went to take another one in second year, at which point I realized I wanted to minor in cinema.

I also did well in all of my cinema courses which was good for the gpa, and the best course I’ve ever had with the best prof I’ve ever had was a cinema course.
