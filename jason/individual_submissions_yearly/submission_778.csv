how to get closer to professors for grad rec letters?,Top_Reflection_2638,1f1sdni,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f1sdni/how_to_get_closer_to_professors_for_grad_rec/,1724689472.0,"like the title says. I'm going into my 3rd year/socsci student, and while I have gotten on a first-name basis with TAs/profs I don't think I'm close enough to ask for a grad school rec letter just yet. 

any tips on getting close to professors? i thought about emailing them after lectures/going to office hours to ask about topics discussed but i don't want to 1) be annoying or 2) detract from students who actually need to meet with the prof because they need help during office hours. 

thanks for any help :)

You're not the only one that is looking for one. Best thing to do is approaching them before or after class early in the year to let them know if it would be possible to get one from them later in the semester ^(they won't remember your name unless you're directly working with them so it's just part of the job),comment,22

Ask a lot of insightful questions towards their current research. Get into their labs. Then they will decide if they want to write letters for you or not,comment,13

Get over 85% in the course. Go to their office hours to get “advice” on papers or study material - even if you don’t need help just go and say you want clarification on stuff. Excel in all assignments and tests. Answer questions when they ask the class. Come prepared to every lecture. Make sure they know who you are by doing this.

I got 98% in a course I was doing. At the start of the course he said he’ll only write 2 letters for a class of 20. He wrote me the best recommendation.",comment,13

The best ways to do this without being annoying is to be well-prepared for the conversation, keep your emails short and direct, and be mindful/aware of other students’ needs. 

In my experience, it isn’t uncommon for office hours of upper year courses to be mostly/entirely empty (especially if there isn’t an assignment due soon). If they have time, most profs are happy to discuss their research interests in more depth.

If you work hard in classes of 15-25 students while also coming to office hours to chat, it’s likely that they will remember you well enough to make a further connection and maybe be a reference. Just make sure your approach is motivated by genuine interest, not just the need for a reference. You’re ahead of the game by thinking about this heading into 3rd year, I think these closer connections will emerge naturally for you.",comment,5

Make sure you explain the process and deadlines for submitting or providing letters. It’s honestly that simple.

(Yes, as others have noted, you can use office hours for this. Do not worry about taking time away from other students; it’s first-come-first-served and the students who genuinely need help rarely attend (classes OR office hours). But don’t book time with a prof just to shoot the shit. I’d much rather a polite email and a task that I can fit into my schedule than a half hour conversation that could have been an email.)

(ETA: Even if you’re on a first name basis, this is a professional request, and your email should reflect that in both tone and address. One of those “small things that is a big thing” in academia.)",comment,3

If you like a prof take lots of courses with them and visit their office hours, participate in class etc. Also highly suggest taking a 4th year course that’s cross listed with grad students if your program offers that to show you can do grad level work and further develop relationship with the prof.
