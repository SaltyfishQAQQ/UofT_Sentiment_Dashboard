So I typed this up in 1h 40 min as reddit cannot save pic as draft.

Summary: y/n has no friend in class, so they made friend with the depressed cubic equation  
Warning: heavy s/m(study math) content

——————————————

You first met the depressed cubic equation in class. 

You have no friends in this class. You had friend(s) in the previous classes of the same prof, but none of your friends is in this class.

When the prof introduced the depressed cubic equation to you, you were not focusing at first.

You were thinking about the word anthropomorphism, you first seen this word in fanfic tag, you've taken anthropology classes before, so you immediately get the meaning of this word when first seeing this word.

Anthropomorphism is a map, with a domain as a class: {not human} mapping to the codomain, the collection: {human}

Now you see the incarnation of the depressed cubic equation, stretching out their hand to you.

The **complex** feeling of the **real** part that your finger tip caresses the equation on the paper, **plus** the sensation of you shaking hands with the depressed cubic equation in the  **imaginary** realm.

The shock of seeing the personification side of the depressed cubic equation made you freeze, after that illusion disappeared, you picked up a pencil and started sketching the image of the depressed cubic equation, to catch a glimpse of their anthropomorphic form.

You stared at the beautiful curves on the sketch you did for the depressed cubic equation.

Let f: R-> R be the polynomial which the zeros of f is the roots of the depressed cubic equation. Which f(x)= x\^3 +mx -n

Let g: R->R\^2 parametrize the image of the polynomial, stating at g(0)=-n

[You cannot resist the urge to investigate the curves on them](https://preview.redd.it/iql64s7daa3e1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=819065dbf82aeb917cb42fe125485f33685e150a)

The curvature, κ = |6x|/(9x\^4 + 6mx\^2 +m\^2 +1)\^3/2 if κ is non negative

[What a beautiful curve that they have!](https://preview.redd.it/oh3d53lmba3e1.png?width=878&format=png&auto=webp&s=9633db0aaaa6ce3b6aef3bbf7bb5cfba385953fb)

""What happened to you that you are so depressed now?"" You asked.

""...""

Maybe they are too depressed to say 

So then you went on the research, you know the depression might come from the secret of them, which Tartaglia told Cardano.

What secret of the depressed cubic equation did Tartaglia told Cardano about in 16th century? Does this caused the depression of the depressed cubic equation?

What had Cardano done to the depressed cubic equation?

After some research, now you know, they are depressed because they lost their quadratic term,  
""Sorry that I don't know your original cubic term and quadratic term,"" As you apologize, 

Let the original cubic coefficient be a, the original quadratic coefficient be b.

x\^3+mx=n -> x\^3+mx-n=0

Let x=y+b/3a

x\^3+mx-n=0 -> (y+ b/3a)\^3 + m(y+ b/3a) - n=0

y\^3 + b/a y\^2 + b\^2/3a\^2 y + b\^3/27a\^3 + my + mb/3a -n =0

ay\^3 + by\^2 + (b\^2/3a + m)y + (b\^3/27a\^3 + mb/3a - n) = 0

Now, the true self of the depressed cubic equation, now cubic equation is revealed.

Seeing the cubic equation is no more depressed, you feel relieved, but you don't know what will happen next.

In an exam, now you are embarrassed. What have Cardano done to the depressed cubic equation? If you don't want to depress the cubic equation, you will definitely loose marks. Even if you betrayed the cubic equation and depress them, you will not get full marks if you don't remember what Cardano, or Tartaglia did to the depressed cubic equation.
