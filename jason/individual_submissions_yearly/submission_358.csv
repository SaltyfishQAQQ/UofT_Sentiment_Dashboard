Implying all old people are compassionate. üòÇ

Age =/= compassion. 

Sure, people with mental illness have trauma of their own. I don‚Äôt think anyone would disagree with that. But unless you‚Äôre trained, and prepared to work with and de-escalate people with mental illness/trauma, it is definitely an increased risk to safety. 

It‚Äôs not at all unreasonable, nor lacking compassion, to prioritize one‚Äôs safety in an understandably dangerous situation. Your high-falutin virtue signalling is unnecessary.",comment,2

So what if a guy who's sick or high or whatever beats your ass on the street because he thinks you have goblins coming out of your eyeballs? He gets arrested, and he'll be back out on the street before you're out of the hospital. Will you still be compassionate in that scenario? 

Is it so criminal to put your own safety/well-being ahead of some deranged person's? 

I'm posing a ""what if"" scenario too, since you started that thread",comment,6

I don‚Äôt want them arrested, I want them to get treatment. That‚Äôs what compassion is. I want them to get help. 

It‚Äôs not criminal to put your well-being first. However, it‚Äôs frankly immoral to comment on a Reddit thread judging a person while they‚Äôre clearly going through an episode and instead of assuming that they‚Äôre on drugs, why don‚Äôt you consider suggesting a solution instead of spreading hate. These are people too. Human beings.

Let me pose another what-if for you. What if this was one of your close family members? Would you be this cold then?",comment,9
