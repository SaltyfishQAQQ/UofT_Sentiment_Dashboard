But what else is offered for free (school amenities, online resources, etc) or at a discount?

In other words, what should I take advantage of during my studies? 

Thanks!",submission,17

Take advantage if you choose to keep it, as you can choose to drop the health insurance coverage if you have other health insurance. Go to the dentist. Go to the optometrist. Get your prescriptions filled. 

Huge amount of libraries, institutional access to a huge variety of journals in a huge number of disciplines, and this is doubly amazing if you're considering research. 

You get the full Microsoft Office suite for free through the university. 

There's the university writing centre that has individual and group tutoring/mentoring/guidance on how to be a better writer, and can provide guidance on written assignments. 

There are math learning centres that can help you with specific math courses (and math in general)- especially useful if you're going to encounter math in your studies. 

here's a list of all student discounts (to my knowledge) that are specific to UofT students:

There's also free admission to the ROM on certain days (though I'm unsure which) for UofT students.",comment,14
