Does uoft have any halloween house parties? Where should I go?,kungfukid02,lu4x6cj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gdub29/does_uoft_have_any_halloween_house_parties_where/lu4x6cj/,1730095794.0,"Grace O'malleys **(Gracies)**: Def a younger crowd (1st years etc.). Only go on **Thursdays**

Maddison Ave Pub (**the Maddi**): Biggest student pub/club. Only go on **Fridays** and **Saturdays.**

Frats: TDX, Phi Kappa Sigma, Lambda Chi. and others. Follow their Instagram to see when they are hosting parties. 

There are tons of exciting bars and clubs on Queen St. West, Ossington, and up and down Bathurst.

If you want the Toronto Club experience go to King West (Escobar, 44, Century, Early mercy, Isabelles, etc) 



**Disclaimer:** If you are an attractive girl, getting into any of these venues is very easy.

If you are a guy, be friendly, cool/attractive, or have money.  Make friends with frat bros, promoters, security guards, bartenders, etc. This gets you out of paying cover and waiting in lines for most places (you gotta be genuine tho, nobody likes a snake that mooches) 

  
**Disclaimer #2:** Be smart; everywhere is safe until you make the wrong decisions. Take agency for your actions and know your limits. Drinking too much, taking substances from people you don't know, and walking alone at night (this one depends on your demographic) can all lead to dire consequences. Some frats have had issues with rape and drugs. Some clubs have had shootings inside and outside of them; The Maddison had a stabbing just out front last year (I was there, and nobody died). Everywhere can be considered dangerous when it's late, dark, and people are intoxicated. **Your decisions decide what happens to you!**",comment,62
