1. Program (spec/major)?
2. Do you research, work for a company, pursuing further education, unemployed?
3. TC if you work?
4. Are you based in Canada or did you move?
5. How much do you think your degree helped you in the real world with what you currently do now?
6. Would you choose your program at uoft again / was it worth it?",submission,18

2. Trading at a bank. Mix of analysis and ops in FX.

3. 110k

4. Canada but Ive looked at moving. Definitely more money in US.

5. I mean without a degree I wouldnt have the job. The math portions are probably far more advanced then what I ever actually use, stats and programming experience was more useful.

6. Id maybe drop the math and pick CS instead. Id like to move more towards electronic trading development.",comment,9

Landed a job at a hedge fund, stayed for 2 years. Raised money for my own startup, failed and returned money to investors. Been at VC job for some time and now looking to get another job. 

I’m doing technical roles so math degree helped. I would say if anything, it helped most with not being afraid to read latest research and understand what people are talking about. 

I rarely apply any “math” I learned at school though

Edit: I wanna share that my most prized learning from uoft was love of learning and an ability to do so. Uoft is hard and if you excel, it means you had to learn how to learn which is really valuable. I'm using it to become fluent in japanese lol",comment,8

My response will be fairly useless compared to others but I'll give some details that'll hopefully be applicable to you:

1. applied stats spec + math major (the math major only required 2 extra courses lmao)

2. pursuing a msc in september. currently a TA and RA for the statistical sciences department before going to graduate school at a different U15 institution. I did not apply to UofT since the master's program is self-funded and course based. (according to professors, the department used to be funded. such a shame!)

3. my stipend is 35k/year ;) (I did do PEY which was 55k/year)

4. stayed in Canada so far!

5. obviously for the TA + RA stuff I needed the stats degree. I definitely didn't need the stats degree for the PEY. a retired stats prof at UofT wrote this up which may be relevant to you (what to do with a degree in statistics): [https://utstat.toronto.edu/brunner/whattodo.html](https://utstat.toronto.edu/brunner/whattodo.html)

6. not worth it; I wish I did a stats major instead with a cs minor (where I would focus on ML). there were so many stats courses that I took where I didn't really learn much (mostly due to the instructors) but also had hard exams (and the questions weren't even that good, just painful computations).",comment,3

2. Going to graduate school at the University of Toronto for the Math MSc program this fall
3. Currently doing gig work for a company called Outlier AI. For me, it makes about as much as a part-time job but the hourly rate is significantly better (50 USD/hour). I wish I found out about it much sooner.
4. 2.
5. I think it helped me with graduate school applications. I took a gap year and tried to find work, where I think it may have helped to get a few interviews, but I could not find a job in the end. These days, you can't get hired without experience.
6. I would have done Math + CS instead of Math + Stats. Stats is a beautiful subject but the employability of the major did not seem to work in my favour.",comment,1

Finance calculations are pretty basic most of the time. The most advanced things are more statistics implemtation. Which there are a lot of methods particularly interpolation I never encountered in any stat course.

A course on quantitative finance is probably useful. At least the theory of pricing all the products. C++ is the standard language youd need to develop on anything doing the actual pricing.

Anything related to modeling is pretty advanced, phd level really. There are lots of different ways to determine the fair price of something and what the spread should be.",comment,3

I would take that course, if I knew where Id end up I would have taken something like that.

One of the more directly useful courses I took at uoft covered some of Elements of Statistical learning. None of them are directly applicable because industry uses more specific models but it gives a good generic overview of the types of things that are out there. The only thing it probably lacks in is time series.

Outside of that I dont really know. Most of finance is still econometrics and time series models, farma french. But there was a jp morgan paper called 'deep hedging' which covers applications of reinforcement learning. That I would say seems to be much of the direction of the most cutting edge stuff in the industry.",comment,2
