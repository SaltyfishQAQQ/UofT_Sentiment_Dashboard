Get involved in research early, it’s never too early to look for research opportunities. You might want to start with work study positions, or volunteering in labs.

Lastly and most importantly, find a way to be happy in uni life. Find joy and happiness in your routine, a positive mindset is very important.

Feel free to DM me if you have more questions to ask, I know there are usually a lot as a first year student. But don’t worry too much, you’ll figure them out gradually. Btw I’m graduating this year…so I might have some input to share if you like. I’m in life sci program.",comment,52

I did my undergrad and masters both at UofT engineering. I did okay academically, but I was always busy partying and wasn’t involved in the community.

if you're in a reading heavy major like i am (polisci), try to do most readings, even if not in depth. they often come back to haunt you in essays and exams later on. figure out a reading method that works best for you. i like cornell style notes of the important arguments and facts!

finally, don't be afraid to reach out for help if you need it. there's nothing wrong with needing accommodations, or a counsellor, or a learning advisor— whatever you need. uoft does have decent resources if you hunt for them. also try to enjoy the libraries if you're on campus, they make working so much more fun than being at home! good luck!!! <3",comment,4

Set time aside for yourself. 
Play after work - though, sometimes playing before work made me more productive (nice treat after a long day!).
Eat proper food... cooking is preferred. (Nutritious and cheap).
Don't hang with friends if you don't want to... but have a little social life ;)
Have a proper sleep schedule... cramming an extra hour of study till 1am won't help you on the exam tomorrow lol.
Don't stress out... I realize how stressful and overwhelming uni (especially uoft) can get; however, it only makes things harder and will eventually kill you. So, don't. 
Make good terms with profs and TAs. Even if it doesn't seem like it in the moment, they only want you to succeed. Make good terms with them, get advice on how to improve and show that you are dedicated!
Attend lectures unless you need to catch up. DO NOT skip lectures for friends, social events, or cuz you're tired. Attend the lecture and ACTUALLY TAKE NOTES. DO NOT go if you're sick. That is just straight up torture for yourself (do online then and ask friends for notes). 
USE THE SYLLABUS. USE THE SYLLABUS. USE THE SYLLABUS. PLEASE. make notes of all the assignments due in the term. Profs aren't teachers and WILL NOT REMIND YOU. if they do, they are saints. Please stay on top of things.
Don't cram due dates. 
Handing in late isn't always bad... sometimes having a finished project with 10% off is better than a 50% done project that is utter dog 💩. Hand in late IF NEED BE. 
I think that's about it for now hahaha. I think the biggest thing is to just have fun and enjoy your time there. Remember that you can always switch your field if you don't like it. You're never stuck and nothing is permanent (that goes for anything in life). Just keep striving to do your best and be ahead of everybody else. At the end of the day, at least YOU KNOW that you yourself did the most you could do. Be content with that.

. If you need anything else or other advice, feel free to DM me! I'd be happy to help you out a bit. I'm a second year, so everything is still fresh to me too ;) 
I'm sure there are many more pointers I can give, but that's the basics. You'll figure everything out just fine - give it time.

I had a lot of experiences from UofT including barely passing first year to being on academic probation because of my marks, to eventually graduating with a PhD in chemistry many years later. Happy to share my pointers with you. 

The main one though is to treat your education, ESPECIALLY, at a select institution as if it is your job. You are there to learn and soak it all up. That means studying, and really figuring out what study methods work for you. I didn’t do that in my first year and prioritized my fun being the first year away from home and I got my butt handed to me quite quickly. Once I figured out how I best learn and retain information it was a game changer for me.

I am a prof and these are my suggestions, from my perspective of the students that do best in my classes:

Go to classes- there are many students here that will say it's not necessary and a waste of time- that's BS. Even if the lecture is boring (mine are not!), it's important to be there to understand the prof's expectations. Try to ask at least one question during every class (I hope all your teachers are open to that, it's tough to be in class if you cannot participate and engage!). This shows you are engaged, but more importantly, it helps you to stay on task and to understand the content. Don't worry if you're question seems dumb- I promise you 100%, it is Not, it never is. 

Take notes, even just basic ones. If the resources are available before class, download the slides and you can take notes right onto them (if you bring a laptop). If you prefer to actually write, then I recommend color coding as you go!

Be pro-active. If there is something coming up, or an assignment you cannot do or think will be late, don't wait till the deadline to ask the prof for an extension- ask as far in advance as possible- that shows that you are being responsible and profs will respond to that well. 

Develop a relationship with your profs so they know who you are. You don't have to be best friends, but if they recognize you and see you in class then you will have their respect, and asking for anything will be much more readily accepted (eg extensions, support). 

Keep track of your deadlines on your calendar, and set up notifications and reminders. Consider how long each assignment will take and work your way backwards to figure out the latest start date. And in my experience, I need to add 30% to the amount of time I assume! I don't know what you are studying, but some assignments can absolutely Not be done last minute since they require supplies or groupwork etc. Think about and write down all of the subtasks of an assignment as soon as you get it, and feel free to ask questions about it in class. 

For group projects, don't be afraid to contact group members. Just go for it. And meet with them, don't just do ask the work separately and expect it will come together. Figure out who is good at what, and share together as a group any fears and weaknesses that team members may struggle with. The group members can support and complement each other to fill in for weaknesses, but only if those are made conscious. 

Find out about other services on campus, and access those that are of interest. Career services is one that I'm sure will be useful to you as you get closer to graduating, but I recommend checking in with them sooner than that.  You might be able to get an internship or something over summer if you connect with them. Accessibility services can be a good suport, too, if you have a learning disability or are neurodivergent etc. I'm not sure how it works at UT but where I work, they craft a letter for the teacher so that the teacher knows and shows some flexibility for that student. And getting that letter also indicates that the student is self motivated and responsible. 

Have fun and party a lot!! Make new friends. Connect with those friends outside of school if they are worthy... These friends may be friends for life! And may be good work connections in future, too. But don't use the entire weekend for partying, you will need some of the weekend to do HW. 

First year will be hardest, since it is so different from high school. You have to be responsible for yourself, nobody will remind you about deadlines, they will just assume you know from the syllabus covered on day 1. You have to be self motivated and grown up about it. And don't worry, it gets much easier to manage in your second year when you figure out your own ""system.""

Make sure the major you are in is what you TRULY are interested in! Don't waste your money and time just going through the motions. If university doesn't suit you, there are tons of great college programs as well that offer shorter, more technical programs that lead to great careers (and TBH I wish I'd known about those before bothering with my undergrad degree.)",comment,1

The university has lots of opportunities and activities. It can be overwhelming. Choose only the ones that you find interesting or helpful, dont try to enroll in every single thing because it will be too much",comment,1

If possible, I think the best case scenario is to go to lectures regardless, and if the prof is spitting nonsense for two hours than you can do other work during the lecture (like from another class or something). At least if anything important is taught, you’re there to hear it, otherwise, I’d say most first year classes are quite significant. You do have a great point!",comment,5
