The good thing though is that the material is very standard so there are a lot of free resources out there. Check out Paul's Online Notes, it was very helpful for me personally.",comment,2

Last year's 244 was fine because there are not a lot of review required for quizzes (just grind some methods of solving related to the quizzes) and the midterms were similar to the examples he posted. The final was a disaster.

This year's 334 is a completely different story. The quizzes need a lot of review, on both a lot of methods of computation and some proofs too, and 3 of the 4 quizzes I had were topics that I did not review well this semester. The quizzes also got a couple of administrative problems not to mention. But hopefully next week's midterm can be similar to his sample one. (same can be said for second midterm, and hopefully this time, the final as well)",comment,1
