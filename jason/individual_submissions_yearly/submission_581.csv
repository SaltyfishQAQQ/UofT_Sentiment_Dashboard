I am in my fifth year and preparing to apply for graduate school but idk how to request letters of recommendation from professors. 

Specifically:

- Should I ask for a recommendation letter in person or via email?

- When is the best time to make this request to give my professors enough time to prepare the letters?

-  How can I determine which professors would be the best to ask for a recommendation?

- What should I do if a professor says no? 



I’m lowkey panicking and would greatly appreciate any advice!",submission,34
How and when do you ask a professor for a reference letter? ,bloody_mary72,llzqjnh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fbdipq/how_and_when_do_you_ask_a_professor_for_a/llzqjnh/,1725733872.0,"Answers to your questions from one professor's perspective:

* Should I ask for a recommendation letter in person or via email?  I personally prefer email.  Make sure to include details of how you know the professor (e.g., I took class X with you two years ago etc.) and what exactly you need help with, including any relevant deadlines.  If students just show up at my office it's awkward if I don't immediately remember them (keep in mind that this isn't personal--a lot of profs teach literally hundreds of students a year) and even awkwarder if it's someone I wouldn't give a letter to.
* When is the best time to make this request to give my professors enough time to prepare the letters? You need to give professors as much time as possible, but if it is more than a few weeks before a deadline, make sure you follow up and remind them closer to when the letter is actually due.  The absolute minimum amount of time you can give them is a week.
* How can I determine which professors would be the best to ask for a recommendation? The best choices are going to be professors who you interacted with in more ways than them just giving you a grade.  Obviously the best choice would be someone you did a work study or volunteer stint with, but barring that, choose someone who you talked to in their office hours etc.  If you didn't do any of those things, the I suppose you can just choose the profs who gave you the highest marks, but be aware that the letter is going to be pretty sterile.
* What should I do if a professor says no?  Move onto someone else.  You definitely don't want a letter from someone whose first impulse isn't to help you.  Just be respectful, say you understand and thank them for their time.",comment,26
How and when do you ask a professor for a reference letter? ,arthurruh,llzubpn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fbdipq/how_and_when_do_you_ask_a_professor_for_a/llzubpn/,1725735150.0,"Here is the template I used that my professor said was excellent and now shares with her students:

  
""Hi Professor,

I hope you are enjoying your summer and enjoying some time off from your teaching \[some personal reference to the professor\]. I am reaching out as I am beginning the process of applying to \[school names, graduate programs, etc\], and would love it if you would be able to write me a reference letter for my applications.

I have taken two classes with you through out my undergraduate career and began my involvement in \[my college\] through your seminar classes. As a result, my entire time at UofT has been defined by \[the college\] - holding seven positions at \[college\], receiving seven awards by the \[college\], and being involved in its governance committees.

Beyond my academic capabilities and approach to learning as a student, you understand my character very well and the spirit I view my professional and personal goals. Hence, my first thought was to reach out to you. Of course, I would provide you with my resume and all of my involvements to make it as easy as possible for you, but the emphasis on our relationship is what I'd value most.

I am mindful of the influx of emails you may be getting pertaining to reference letters. That being said, if you are able to write one for me, I would be eternally grateful. Please let me know at your earliest convenience and I'll be sure to send you the particulars.

Regards,""

I asked another professor for a letter as well, but instead of focusing on my leadership qualities and extracurricular involvements, I asked them to focus on my academic performance. It was similar to the email above, but the second last paragraph was switched to:

""I currently have another reference writing about my personal/professional development and my contributions as a leader in my extracurriculars. As such, I would like this letter to focus on my academic rigour, my spirit inside the classroom, my approach to learning, my character as a student, and, ultimately, our relationship.""

To your questions:

Ask via email.

Reach out as early as possible. If I remember correctly, I reached out two months before the deadline. The recommendation I've been given is no later than 6 weeks before the deadline.

Any professor that knows more about you than the average professor would. If you never spoke to them beyond regrades/basic questions, they probably aren't a good fit.

Move on to the next.

Best of luck!",comment,19
How and when do you ask a professor for a reference letter? ,BeginningInevitable,llzz8oy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fbdipq/how_and_when_do_you_ask_a_professor_for_a/llzz8oy/,1725736849.0,"-I personally emailed because I didn't know my professors too well unfortunately. If you don't think it would be awkward, I think asking in person is okay too.

-You should ask in September and October ifthe apps are due in December or January, November is a little late and some professors might have already reach their quota of LORs they have committed to writing.

-You should ask the profs who know you the best, who can vouch that you did good work if you got a very good grade in their class, that you did research with (don't fret if you don't have any research, as I didn't either), etc. Basically, the best profs to ask would be ones who can write more specifically about your academic abilities instead of a generic letter saying you did well in their course.

However, if it does come to that, I personally think it's helpful to professors if you send info like unofficial transcript, a document describing the work you did in their courses, a copy of a draft personal statement, etc. so that they can know more about you and give them something to write about.

-If prof says no I would thank them for their time and move on. Either they thought they wouldn't be able to write a good letter for you, or they had already committed to writing too many letters. In either case, I highly recommend not taking it personally.

Also, I have it's customary to thank the professor for helping to write the application and to inform them about your program acceptances. I think many of them would be happy to know they helped you to succeed with applications.

Good luck!",comment,4

If they say yes, then remind them 2-3 weeks out. Thank them again as the deadline approaches. Most profs are busy so if they have any EQ they will appreciate the reminders. They shouldn't find you annoying.

Then you can thank them in person when everything works out.

Some profs may say no, but that's just indicative of how busy they are or they have another competing student they already said yes to. It's a rare occurrence-- no way a reflection on you.

Usually if you do really well in a course and you have correspondence with them (like you emailing them for help), your prof would have mentioned that you are more than welcome to keep in touch. Sometimes they'll even reach out to you about the course you did with them wishing you well. It's their way of hinting to you that you did so well that they'll write a recommendation for you.

Younger profs are also inexperienced in this so you can literally ask them for a reference because they would not realize they could (or should) do the above. So as long as you got an above average grade in the course they'll be happy to help you with minimal questions asked.",comment,3

2. I asked 2 months before the letters were needed. Profs are busy so the earlier the better imo. 
3. I asked profs who I had a good relationship with, whose course I did well in, and who taught me in upper year courses (all mine were profs from my 400 level courses). 
4. Just say okay thank you no worries and email other profs.",comment,2

When? For a stellar one, just wait until you feel you have licked them enough, like clean.

Jokes apart. State your purpose and politely ask will they support you, and of its ok for them to write for you.

Most will agree, provided you have worked with them. Of they tell you a polite no, smile and say I guess you're right and walk off ( in your head you can use cuss words)

And best is to ask in person, don't email just confront. 
Emails can be used for reminders. Allow them atleast 3 to 4 weeks.

Hope this helps.",comment,2

I emailed, and I would suggest you do it asap. Letters for my grad program were due end of November and your profs need some time. 

My email went something like this:

Hi (professor), 

I hope you’ve had a great summer! I’m reaching out to ask if you would be willing to write me a reference letter for (XYZ program) which I will be applying to for next fall. I’ve attached my CV and transcript for your reference, and I’m happy to make myself available to meet in person or via zoom if you have any more questions or want to discuss. 

Thanks in advance and kind regards, 
Me

My undergrad program was kind of unique in that 99% of people have to do a grad program in order to become registered in our field, so just about every prof is expecting to be asked for a letter from at least a few students. I was lucky to have really good working relationships with the two profs I asked, and I think that really helped my applications because they knew me quite well.",comment,1

Once they've written you one letter, they will do a very small amount of tailoring for the other programs.  So it's not a huge ask to do a couple more.  I definitely wouldn't reduce the number of programs you're applying to out of fear of inconveniencing your prof.

The best thing you can do is make it as easy as possible for them to submit your letters.  Ideally I prefer to do all the letters for a given student at the same time.  Depending on the various schools' systems that may not be possible, but make sure that you have provided your prof all the information about when the letters are due, how they are being submitted etc.  If you have to submit part of your application to the system to get it to send a prompt for the letter to the prof, do that in plenty of time so the professor isn't scrambling.",comment,2
