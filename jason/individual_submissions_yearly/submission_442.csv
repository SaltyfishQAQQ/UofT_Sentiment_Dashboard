Genuine ask for your best advice and tips on this because I can't anymore,deleted,1ftx9kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ftx9kr/genuine_ask_for_your_best_advice_and_tips_on_this/,1727812182.0,"Bro, how does one stay FOCUSED???? How do you guys go about doing 30-40-50-60 page readings constantly without being distracted every second? What should take 2-3 hrs turns into 5-8 hrs because of constant distractions. Even from someone who doesn't use social media, I kinda always get distracted by anything. Even being alone in the library study rooms. I'll look at my phone at random stuff (reddit, photos, apps I never used in 10 yrs), etc. Even without my phone when I leave it at home, I look at stuff through another browser on my laptop... literally anything. The the time just FLYS!

Like how do ppl get so focused and in grind that they can study for 4-6-8-10 hrs without taking 59398422 breaks. Genuinely curious. I feel like I might have ADHD!?! Does meds actually help? But tbh any suggestions other than meds would be helpful bc I don't wanna go through all that stuff.

  
Please and thanks",submission,57

When I get that urge to pick up my phone and check it for random stuff (lolllllllll ""apps I never used in 10 years"" I 10000% do that too) - I have to look over at my phone and see the timer counting down. It reminds me that I'm supposed to be concentrating. 

Just that little interruption to the normal process helps me - it's so automatic to just pick up my phone and look at it, sometimes I will pick it up, check personal email, work email, reddit, a news app... put it down and IMMEDIATELY FORGET THAT I JUST DID THAT AND PICK IT UP AGAIN AND LOOK AT THE SAME STUFF.

One mistake I made when trying to start this is I picked times that were way too long. Like I'd set it for an hour and like 5 minutes in I'd give up. I started setting it for like 15 minutes. Just to see if I could make if that long. It's like training muscles - start with manageable amounts and work up from there.

I don't know. I mean here I am responding to your post on reddit when I'm supposed to be working, but I am setting my timer as we speak. Let's see if I can make it 45 minutes without coming back here.",comment,22

Colour coding notes and making doodles related to topic is good way to make process fun :D",comment,9

That will definitely make the piece harder to digest. Read intro/conclusion and make an outline with main arguments and methods. Once that is done, it will be easier for you to skim through it quickly. What is your current strategy and what kind of course is this for?

*I feel it might be that you find it dense/boring which makes your brain pay attention to anything but the reading. At least that was my case. If you know what to look for exactly, you might be able to do it more effective and in less time.",comment,8

This book literally changed my life, and taught me how to study. 

Tips for readings: 
Pick the most important reading from each class and give it the most attention you can. Try the Cornell method first for summarizing/ getting key themes. Spend some time on a weekend finding a study/notetaking method that works for you if Cornell doesn't.

For the rest of your readings, just read the abstract and the last paragraph. Starting sentences of paragraphs can be helpful for key themes and ideas.

Study in 50 minutes on 15 minute off blocks. Human brains can't concentrate past that mark effectively.

Swallow the frog. Do the hardest thing first and the rest will feel easy. Prioritize bigger assignments over readings.

Schedule time in your day for work. Tell someone your schedule to keep you accountable.

Balance school work and life by breaking large tasks into smaller pieces. Kill the dragon and make it into goblins. Take them out one by one.

Go to office hours early before it's too late and you can't get help. Book writing centre early, it fills up.

Don't leave things until 10pm night of. Procrastination hurts your soul more than just doing it.

Get accommodations if you find you're struggling with your health or disabilities.

Be kind to yourself, get things done early when you can.

Multiple broken up study sessions are better than an all nights Robarts cramming sesh. 

Don't study with your friends if they distract you. If it actually helps, good. Otherwise schedule some social time instead of trying to half focus on both.

Keep work space and bed / eating space / couch seperate. Let your brain shift modes by going to an environment dedicated to your learning, either by having a desk or visiting libraries.",comment,7

Before I was diagnosed I’d have a task to do (like a problem set) and I knew I could complete it in like 1-2 hours assuming I stuck to my plan and did not take impulsive doom scrolling breaks. But that never happened so something that should take 1-2 hours takes 3-5. 

It got worse and worse the more burnt out I got because I had to push harder to get shit done. It got so bad to the point where I’d be sitting in the library all day trying to hype myself to get my work done. After sometimes 45 minutes of doing that I’d get started and I’m not even kidding 2 minutes in and I’m back on instagram reels …and I’m talking the web browser not the app so it was bad. 

The channel How to ADHD is quite helpful! The occupational therapist I see recommends her and sometimes sends me her videos. Even if you don’t have a diagnosis you can still use the methods and techniques in the videos. ",comment,2

2) reading out aloud— started doing this a month ago and it's a game changer, cause while speaking I'm not getting distracted + I'm also listening so the readings going in my head and they start making sense!
