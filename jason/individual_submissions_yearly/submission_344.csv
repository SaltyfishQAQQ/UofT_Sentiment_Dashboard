All the Best to future students going to university,Admirable-Curve-8868,1d0ezce,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d0ezce/all_the_best_to_future_students_going_to/,1716652385.0,"There are no losers in life. You either win or learn. With admission season around, it seems heartbreaking for someone not getting their dream offer. Who knows it may turn out to be better than your dream offer. But you will only realize it once time passes by. 

Life is about living and moving on without any regrets!
Learn and move on! Give your bestest to the offer you have in hand. Donâ€™t curse anyone, remember, every action has an equal and opposite reaction. What you give, comes back to you in some form or the other so always give what you expect to receive! 

All the very best to the wonderful future students for a bright and positive future! ",submission,76
