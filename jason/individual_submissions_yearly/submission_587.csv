Is Gerald Penn the boogeyman of UofT CS? I might be tweaking for the 401 exam,Eitherwinter,1h8zxie,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h8zxie/is_gerald_penn_the_boogeyman_of_uoft_cs_i_might/,1733599174.0,"He oversees the grad students in CSC485 and apparently he gave a bunch of them zeros on some essays for not attending lecture (not mentioned in syllabus?). I also heard that in past years for CSC485 when he was the instructor, he tried to give AOs to 40 percent of the class, and in CSC401's final exam last year, he made it so difficult as to try to fail a third of the class. Is this guy the Grinch who stole Christmas irl or are these stories mythology to scare undergrads?",submission,34

Nothing you said here surprises me, especially the essays.

That being said, boogeyman is probably a stretch. Nothing infamous like the stats department of SMT for math. In the end you can just avoid computational linguistics if you're a regular CS major.",comment,16

I do think the 0 on essays is unfair, and I hope it gets addressed — at the very least, I wish he recognizes that we deserved a warning or communication from him to understand that we weren’t meeting course expectations. 

But I was also incredibly impressed by how much feedback he gave us for the first few essays. I have never had an instructor who actually read each submission and gave us detailed feedback for it… it helped me reflect on my writing and the course design made me more interested in computational linguistics. (I took semantic analysis with Yang Xu last year, and it was one of the best courses I ever took though)

So… I don’t really think he’s _that_ bad. I think he’s a good instructor - as in I am amazed by how much he knows and wants to share. But, he can benefit from understanding the student experience in his course more.",comment,10

I wonder what is the deal with him trying to outright frame students for AO out of his slight suspicion,comment,1
