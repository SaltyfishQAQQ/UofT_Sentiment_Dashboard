I graduated in 10 years with a 2cgpa and feel so ashamed,mirodus,1gyw640,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gyw640/i_graduated_in_10_years_with_a_2cgpa_and_feel_so/,1732468826.0,"I literally would kill for a 3.0.
Every instance of success stories from bad gpas I‚Äôve read online have been atleast over a 2.5 or they‚Äôve had crazy extracurricular experiences to make up for it.

Unlike myself. I just worked minimum wage jobs throughout school to support myself and even while being a student I think I had a defeatist mentality and didn‚Äôt bother applying to anything that was more challenging due to my grades.

I feel like a failure and that I‚Äôve ruined my chances to get any decent job + if I wanted to upgrade and ever go to grad school later on (maybe not for now‚Ä¶ or ever) I‚Äôd have to go through another 4 years of school and try again to make up for it

I came to another country after graduating to find work, and at every interview they‚Äôre asking me why it took so long to graduate. It‚Äôs also mandatory that I put my cgpa in my profile so I can‚Äôt get out of omitting my grades and my starting year üôÉ

It makes me so sad whenever I look at comments talking about people feeling like a failure with a low gpa cause mine is lower. I‚Äôve actually had a 1.5 in third year and barely raised it to a 2.01 by the final semester.

I‚Äôve tried to come up with legitimate answers like having a chronic undiagnosed auto immune disorder / undiagnosed adhd and minimal support at home while having to support myself financially and being constantly burnt out from emotional labour of my family but honestly they all sound like excuses and people have advised me to refrain saying the truth so I‚Äôm just coming up with some bs excuse that still makes me marketable enough.

My friends and family try to comfort me and tell me that I‚Äôve had other life experiences but they don‚Äôt know how bad my grades are. And frankly, it‚Äôs made me feel useless all my life. I‚Äôve always dropped my courses and lwd or would just refuse to hand in assignments 60% of the time because I just had so much shame and anxiety around it. I try not to talk about how insecure I feel over my grades cause I‚Äôm old enough but I am.

But it‚Äôs okay. I have another interview tomorrow and I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs one company that might accept me. Wish me luck.

Update; Fyi i am okay guys im happy most of the time i‚Äôm done i just really wanted to vent 


Update (2025) ; hehe everyone thank you for the overwhelming support and happy 2025! I found me a pretty nice big girl job and am happy with where I am!!! There‚Äôs hope :)",submission,311

Not necessarily. Do you mind mentioning what program you were in and what you'd want to do in grad school? Example: if you have a BA, doing another BA would likely only be about 2 years total, with possibility to finish it in less time with summer semesters. This is also the case for other programs- unless you do something completely different from the previous degree. Search up ""second degree"" or ""post-bacc"" degrees.

One thing about all of this though is that you did it regardless. At the end of the day life is long and you have time to live 20+ years of life and make it what YOU want! But first that starts with being healthy and therapy, which you already mentioned you are in which is great.",comment,30

Due to a medical condition and a whole bunch of personal and family problems, my gpa was also terrible at UofT. When I was severely depressed, I had to take LWD for lots of courses.I could not bring myself to go to class or even submit anything. I didnt get LWD for some of the courses so I ended up with 7-10% as my final grade. That ruined my GPA. I took a year off and transferred to another university in a city that I had family and friends in. My grades in this university are great and I was able to transfer my credits. I still work and do school and am still continuing treatment for my medical condition and I have been able to manage it so far. It does take some balancing but it will get better OP. Regardless of if you want to get a second degree (will be less than 4 years because some of your completed credits will be counted in your new degree) or if you keep searching for a job, I am hopeful that you will be able to do it. And remember that not every job cares abt your GPA. If you have work experience that is GREAT! Those skills are what you want to highlight in your resume. You can just put your degree in your resume but don‚Äôt need to include the grades (unless this is an academic job that needs to see your transcripts). You got this! I am rooting for you!!",comment,14

Idk if this will be helpful, but I‚Äôm in my sixth year and I‚Äôm in the same boat. Initially, I did okay, and even though I had a hard time, and struggled with feelings of inadequacy I was on track to graduate on time. In my fourth year, after suffering a series of unfortunate events (a horrible break up, losing out on some life changing job opportunities), I had a mental break down and I couldn‚Äôt hand in my final assignments. I petitioned the courses, and got approved but my mental health spiralled further and further as I dealt with what had been previously suppressed mental health issues that manifested in executive dysfunction. I would stare at my computer for hours at the library, working from 6 AM to midnight only to get a couple of sentences in, and eventually my petition failed and I had to submit a new one. 
Before this, I had started to apply to grad school and had been insecure about my gpa (which at the time was a 3.45) so I convinced myself an extra year would make up for the poor gpa and the fact that I stumbled in the end. In fact, things got worse. I took more courses, but with my mental health in the dumps, all I did was ruin my academic progress in a cycle of taking on too many responsibilities: 6 courses, jobs, extracurriculars, then failing or dropping everything. I got a research assistant position with a professor who would have made a great recommendation for law school if not for the fact that I ghosted her when I was overwhelmed, and burned a bunch more bridges with people I overpromised and underdelivered to. 

When I look back at it all, I am so embarrassed and shameful because if I had stopped at any point, I would have realized I was on an extremely destructive path but I thought that the only thing worse than doing something and failing was doing nothing at all. Now, I‚Äôm enrolled part time with courses I still never completed (with multiple F‚Äôs) and a 2.9 GPA, but I think I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve been in a while. Although I feel a lot of anxiety about the fact that I ruined my prospects for grad school/law school, I think for once I‚Äôm not depressed. My mental fortitude and elasticity makes me feel like I can endure something without shattering, which is where I was before. It‚Äôs a good place to be in, and a place where I can healthily negotiate future steps. I think in the future a second BA might be on the table, but for now, I‚Äôm happy at the prospect of being done after next semester!

Good luck for finishing! Your long journey is over, and you accomplished something great!!",comment,13

I‚Äôve got no advice other than- Forget about your school years and welcome to adulthood.

I thought universities give you a maximum of 8 years to graduate, otherwise they will kick you out no (unless you switched universities during the 10 years)? Ik it‚Äôs mostly the part time students who take up to 8 years.
Also were you working full time during your studies or just part time (are there any transferable skills from your jobs), and did you do any extracurriculars or internships? Bc those can help compensate for low gpa to an extent. If you don‚Äôt have any luck with job offers (that is if they can‚Äôt look past your gpa or depending on your relevant experience) or if u absolutely want to do grad school, worst case scenario you might be cooked if you don‚Äôt do a second degree, and maybe in a field you‚Äôre more interested in.",comment,2

After struggling for 4 years in UofT with a GPA of 2.1 now I finally find a sentence to describe my thoughts. (My roommate and former roommates are morons anyways lol.) If I don't fail any class this year I'll graduate in 4 years, same as everyone else.

OP, keep it up, most companies couldn't care less about GPA. And if someone in a similar situation and still want to go to a grad school like me, some decent Australian universities basically accept anyone with a Canadian bachelor's degree (that's what I learnt and I'm working towards it). Or learn Japanese/Korean and Japanese/Korean grad school don't look at GPA. Or Malaysia, Philippines and South Africa. We will all find ways out.",comment,4
