With this in mind, I would've ""only"" taken 7 or 8 years to finish, but then COVID happened....ever since the pandemic started, my life has been marred by substance abuse and mental illness :'( The last time I ever passed a course was in summer 2021, and I have been either dropping courses or failing them for the past few years....I have just 8 more courses that I need to finish, and then that's it....my GPA itself is not bad, though, and I am still in good standing.",submission,32

You paid for them, and you earned them when you passed.

Just keep chugging along.

My mother took nearly 3 decades to finish her degree, and then she got 2 more after!

Hope youâ€™re in a better place now.

Good luck!",comment,34

You should have valid documentation for accommodations. I think the education system is far more aware / accommodating of these issues nowadays.,comment,7

B: talk with the registrar of your college. Make a face-to-face appointment with them. They want you to graduate.Â 


C: I know for some programs the limit is 7 years. But again there may be flexibility given the stuff going on for you, so be open with them about how you are doing and your plan to finish the degree asap.",comment,5

I was a similar boat as you. Started in 2014 and by 2018 my substance abuse issues and mental health went to shit. I stopped going to school and took the time to get clean and get my mental health back in order. Because of this, I had to apply for re-admission to my program. I got accepted back in 2022 and I am now graduating this June! It may be worthwhile to take a break while you work on yourself. If not, I went to TMU so I'm not sure if it's the same for UofT, but if you pass the max amount of time to finish your degree I believe you need to file for an extension and state the reasons why, along with supporting documentation. When I applied to be re-admitted I had a form filled out by my doctor explaining that I was unable to fulfill my educational duties due to health issues (they don't have to specify what your issues were btw). 

Hopefully this helps, and good luck!!
