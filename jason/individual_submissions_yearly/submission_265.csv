I never my entire life think I would have failed so badly not only in one but 4 of my courses. For reference as to how bad it was I got a 52% in bio120, 40% in chm135, I know I fails math cause I didn’t know what I was doing and physics I legit got a 12/24 on my multiple choice. Like I don’t know what to do anymore. I come to campus, study in the morning attend lectures, write notes and study until 6pm everyday then commute home. It’s annoying because I don’t have friends I skip out on things I want to do just to study and now that it is reading week I’m probably gonna continue studying. How can I possibly get a 4.0 GPA now. Everything in my life is falling apart and for someone like me who likes chemistry it is so disappointing. What should I do to at least finish some of these courses with an 80%? It makes me so depressed to hear others get like 90% on assignments and all there mid terms and still go out to party while I’m always calculating the amount of time I get home and study. I occasionally had to lie to people that I did good because no offense some people like to feel superior over you. It’s not about the friends but really about how can I bounce back and do better.

Take it slow, you'll be fine. I don't know if you're serious or not but it doesn't matter, I'll tell you about my experience.

In first year I failed multiple courses and ended the year on academic probation (cgpa<1.5). It took a while but I worked my way back up to a decent gpa in 2nd year. 

It's going to be difficult in first year, I wanted to quit multiple times, my mental health suffered, I wanted to end my life at one point. I was struggling bad and didn't know what to do.

I'm not you so I don't know if this advice is right for you, but I was told to stick through it even though I failed, and most importantly to build social connections with people in AND out of university. That was particularly difficult to do but having people around me who were also struggling with similar things made me feel much better. People at Uoft are shy but many of them are as nervous as you and many are struggling academically and mentally as well. You might have to pester them a bit at first to get out of their shells, but they will. So if someone tries to talk to you, don't shut down either, take the opportunity. The university doesn't care about your mental health, so we need to care about each other's.

As for your gpa, I know it sucks and it hurts but it's ok. A 4.0 isn't everything and gpa for grad school only usually matters in your last two academic years as that what grad schools generally look at. As for med school and the such, they also care to see that you improved, which is very much possible trust me.

A final note, too much studying can hurt you, take breaks and relax, it'll help your learning in the long run. I would also say don't stress because you don't understand something, being worried about learning something won't help you learn it any better. Also review old material often and with regular breaks and changes of environment. Finally sleep and eat well, it'll help your learning as well",comment,12

Your midterm shouldn’t be your first evaluation, you should go through as many practice questions as you can before hand. 

If you don’t have practice questions upload the weeks lecture slides into ChatGPT, get it to quiz you or find a textbook with questions and solutions on the same topic, or even more advanced, come up with your own questions. Writing normal notes is one of the lowest forms of studying, do it only if the textbook, lecture slides, and lecture notes are crap or if you have the extra time. 

I think you need to keep track of your hours and also look into better learning methodologies, ask your professors and TAs how they would study. Go to the academic skills centre and also watch some videos on YouTube on learning (Cal Newport, Benjamin Keep, Barbara Oakley, Justin Sung, Archer Newton, etc.). The good news is that you probably have a lot of improvement ahead of you.",comment,5

Take that as a wake-up call and improve. 
And studying X amount of hours does not mean anything, you need to be efficient.

Check your module breakdown for the weightage, mid terms is probably 30% (maximum) of the entire module grade.

As long as the tendency to quit and or commit suicide does not take over you, you are doing great job. You are doing the most you can in a highly ranked university, that is means more than anything else. You have to believe that you are capable of doing better and it will get better. It does not matter if it improved by how much, all it matters is that it improved. 

Plus first year grades don’t matter and you can always start the credit no credit so it won’t show in your transcript. But let say you are applying to med school, the would rather see you be able to improve than be constant.

what i would recommend doing is evaluate HOW you study. the hours only mean so much, your method is more important because the method is what makes your studying effective. i realized i can learn and understand better if i can explain a whole concept and provide examples, and make study questions for myself that assess my actual understanding of the concepts. my approach is usually thinking if i wanted to grill another student in my class on the test content, what would I ask? do both MC and short answer, long answer too if your courses have anything like that

I suggest you really go look at the test questions and figure out why you didn’t know the answers. How did you study that made u not be able to answer those questions? I would also suggest maybe lowering ur work load take less classes. It took me longer to graduate by a year and half but when I started I was a mess and depressed. Honestly not worth it.

U of T (St.George) works exactly like this. What is your class standing relative to the mean? Use this as your guide as to whether you will succeed. The profs feel that if their exams don't generate a 60% class average, their exam is too easy. Unfortunately, this means that mere memorization won't work. You really have to understand the concepts behind the information. Also, to achieve this level of understanding, you must study until midnight and your 6pm cutoff isn't enough time. Sorry to put it bluntly, but your classmates are likely from the top 1 to 2% of their high-school and they are used to working themselves  much harder than you seem to work. Just work longer and organize yourself better so you can study more. This should give you better results on the next exam. Every graduate of U of T has been where you are now so keep going.

Don’t give up. The transition from highschool to first year life sci is a tough one. Like others have said, uoft tests differently and you will not be able to get by on memorization alone.

My advice is: attend office hours. Ask TA’s for help as they’re the ones who grade your labs. Practice questions and exams go a long way! There are tons of resources for past exams out there, just need to be a little crafty about it at times.

I had a 1.9GPA at the end of my first year and graduated life science after 4 years with a 3.6. You can do it, it might take some time and really hard discipline (which you seem to have), but you can do it :)

I found 136 much easier. I retook chm135 in my second year and did much better when I focused on doing literally every textbook practice problem for each unit. For bio130, stick to the lecture notes and don’t bother with the textbook unless you need clarification. When I took the course, the textbook quizzes had unlimited attempts so it made it unnecessary to read the textbook and gave me a great question bank to practice for the exams. For phy131, again do as many practice problems as you can, go to office hours if you’re stuck and I used khan academy for a lot of the content because I understand how they explain it better. There’s a lot of resources online that can help with all of the concepts you learn in first year that imo were better than the profs. Also profs will provide you with past midterms…DO THEM. Majority of the time they have a few of those questions on the exams so that’s free marks. You may not get a 4.0 this semester but you can still bring up your mark through labs and the final exam. Next semester you can apply the new study strategies from the beginning and it will hopefully help you bring up your gpa. Not all hope is lost and you can get through this, don’t give up yet.

Idk if you'll ever see this, but if you do, don't give up. If you want someone to help you study if you do end up deciding on working to improve, feel free to reach out to me (ig handle- nathansu.22). I don't want to get into specifics and flex but I got above 90 in both the chem and bio midterm (but I kinda flunked my physics). I understand and remember what it felt like to be lost and feel behind in classes. Although I'm also trying to figure this out, don't hesitate to ask questions to me or other students.",comment,1

The transition from high school to university is a big adjustment, and it’s common to struggle—I know I did. Moving to a new city where you don’t know anyone, building a routine, and tackling tough courses all at once is challenging. For example, in my first year of health sciences, I barely passed biology with a 60, and I ended up dropping chemistry, only picking it up in later semesters because I was falling behind. Now, a few years later, I’ve graduated with my master’s. I’d suggest reaching out to professors or counselors in your faculty or program—they might have advice on strategies or alternatives that could help. You’ve got this!",comment,1

I certainly thought fresh out of high school that I was very prepared for whatever life threw at me next, but getting near failing marks for my UofT assignments and couple tests was a pretty harsh wake up call. However, that motivated me to get much better. Sometimes the hurdles are the best teachers, even if they suck in the moment.

And like everyone else says- it’s your first year. Most of us have been through something like that, and yet we’re still here. I wish you success in the future- reach out to your teachers or if they provide good feedback for assignments you should certainly take it as you can only do better the next time.",comment,1

I guess life science major is too difficult for you probably. You might get academic probation after Year 1 since your average is a bit low .

, Academic suspension is below 1.5 GPA. which is below average of 60.

I suggest you change major, it might help your university journey.

I end up switching major to art degree in higher year. My university journey is more happier here and after.",comment,1
