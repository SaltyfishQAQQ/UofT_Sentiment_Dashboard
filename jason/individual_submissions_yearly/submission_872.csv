I started as a research assistant, and was doing just very basic stuff around the lab, but I fell in love with the work, going to conferences, learning everyday. I initially wanted to go to med school but realized I like research much more than the prospect of medicine. 

I really do recommend being a research assistant for a bit or doing an undergraduate thesis if you’re interested in research at all. It’s pretty low stakes, and if it doesn’t work out you can just let that experience be your only research experience and move on with your life",comment,8

December, 2012. I was 11, still in elementary school and a bit of a recluse kid, I saw an anime. That anime was called Sword Art Online. It featured a device called the nerve-gear which was in essence a device that accomplished the same thing that the matrix from the movie: ""The Matrix"" does except without the invasive cranial plug.

I went online and looked around for efforts working towards creating this tech. There were a few ideas floating around but none of them directly approached creating something like the nervegear.

So I played a gamble with myself, and its a gamble I'm still playing. If no one is going for it, fine, I'll do it myself. The exact quote I was thinking of when I made this decision: 

*""Damn the torpedos, FULL. STEAM. AHEAD.""* -Admiral David Glasgow Farragut, United States Navy: Inspires you to commit your all to an challenge, including throwing a kitchen sink at it. 

Grades wise, I was mostly a B student in elementary school, B+ in early High school, got my act together in 11th and 12th grade to hover around a low 80 average which, at the time, was sufficient to let me slip into the neuroscience specialist program at UofT. Along the way, I attended a neuro-research training program for high school students at UC Davis in California. My supervisors, two tenured profs at UC Davis (I keep in touch with both AND one now works at U. Arizona) advised me on the business aspects that goes into the research enterprise. I took their advice and attended the Canadian SHAD program the following year.

Started Uni rough (Pandemic and personal family loss, grandparents got wiped out), held the thin red line in first year with a 3.6 average but got overwhelmed, overrun, and isolated in second year with an abysmal GPA while my peers continued on soaring; excellent GPAs, landing lab positions, and getting scholarships. No research opportunities available in the discipline I wanted to do research in so I started looking elsewhere. Got a summer job that engrained in me the horrors of working a minimum wage labour job, jobsite politics, and what it felt like to get tossed around like a bean bag by a superior who was clearly out to make people's lives harder.",comment,7

I mean I loaded my efforts into a single Armor Piercing Discarding Sabot shot and sent it flying. Got the GPA damage under control and landed two research positions by the end of third year: one with a super publisher in health academia, another in UofT. 

Got my first publication in December of 4th year and stuck around the UofT lab. Got into two more labs at UofT and by the beginning of my fifth year, was on a roll with a thesis project. Moment of judgement came in December 2023 as I applied for grad school. This was the first do or die evolution that had to be overcome if I was to continue with the gamble.

Fast forward to today, I still cannot understand how not *'scared sh\*tless'* and how *'bats\*it crazy'* I was when I decided to take this path when I was 11. But anyways, graduated with high distinction in June and I'm immediately coming back to UofT for MOAR through a PhD and an opportunity to work with the people I know by their first name together with an inspiring and honest supervisor.

# ""how did you know you wanted to do it?""

Validation and self reflection. 

Validation is... more like a 'sanity check' than a source of motivation for. I asked a lot of questions, mostly directed at individuals who were well above my age cohort. They knew more than I did and I recognized I needed their feedback and guidance to promote my personal growth and ensure I'm not investing in something stupid. 

Self reflection... it's important. A review of your day's, week's, month's, year's, and decade's worth of effort towards single, long-term objective. Life as a common man/woman is like building your own pyramid that just might be remembered into the far off future. You lay each stone, one brick at a time, one day at a time. In my book, if you want to do research as a career, you should understand that. Self reflecting is a service your present self does for your past self and for your future self. Acknowledge to yourself that you've come a long way but there is still a long road ahead. 

All this, and well... today I think I can give my shot at a career in research. I *think* that I have been through enough in life, both the good and the bad, to enable me to have the privilege to have what I have today.

One last minuted addition: It is often overlooked or not decisively acted upon by students at UofT, but, surround yourself with individuals who provide mutual benefits and inspire you to push yourself. Knowing people from different walks of life, at different stages of their life plan,  in peril or joy, helps you keep an eye on the big picture and who you are. Today, I have friends who have gone into the same PhD program as me, others who have gone to Oxford for graduate studies. I even hold monthly phonecalls with several American SOF (ex. Navy SEALs, MARSOC) operators. Yes, most of my friends are older than me but who cares? They usually pick up the restaurant bill.

These connections help me keep my emotions and actions in check for the better. Whether in the darkest hours or the day I saw my UofT PhD offer, they ensure I stayed true to myself.

Anything in life worth doing is worth overdoing. Moderation is for doubters. I'm a breacher, I'm a fighter, I'm a wall burrowing opportunity creating rat. I'll drink, eat, entertain, and sneak out the back door when the cheesing is done. So if you're feeling froggy, then you better jump, because this rat has been there, done that and is going back for more. 

Cheers fellas.",comment,6
