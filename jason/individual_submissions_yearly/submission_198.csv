Where were you when the incident occurred?

According to the varsity spontaneous combustion is obviously more probable then someone lighting it on fire with an added fuel source.

As for the hand sanitizer perhaps if it was in an electric dispenser I could see that malfunctioning and causing the alcohol to ignite somehow. other then that it was either lit on fire or not your typical hand sanitizer,comment,3
