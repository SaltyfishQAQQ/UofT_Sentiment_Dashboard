"As I hate to say this, I'm contemplating on dropping out",deleted,1f6waep,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f6waep/as_i_hate_to_say_this_im_contemplating_on/,1725245478.0,"This may come as a surprise to you, but I had made my decision to drop out of university and join an occupation that I would enjoy.



I know that I'm an Ontario Scholar who had the opportunity to go to a prestigious university, but I find that the work there is difficult, and there are concerns that I may burn myself out by studying five or six courses at once, having to check my emails 24/7, being forced to deprive myself from sleep, and every test or quiz occurring every week. It will be safe to say that it's the best if I go into sports (track and field or boxing, either and or both) or get a job that I'll be happy with, has good pay and a good work/life balance.



It's time that I had made my decision, as I have no choice but to do what is the best for my well-being. Sometimes as an ignorant person I have to think harder and understand that some things that I do are not for me, 





I want to relocate to another place in Canada to pursue my occupational ideas and start a new life. The stress, the intense pressure, competitive nature where I had been living for years had worn me out. It's too stressful to cope with. In addition, I'm fed up by how the way people treated me back then (before and during Uni), and the past keeps haunting me. It's about time to relocate to forget about all of the sad 





It's done.",submission,24

Before you decide on something else, it helps to travel and experience another culture. This will give you time for your mind to relax, reflect and decide on what path to follow. There are advisors at UofT but the best is to take a break before deciding on the next move. It's called a gap year and helps prevent total burn out. 

Here are some ways. 

[Work and travel abroad with International Experience Canada (IEC)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/canadians/international-experience-canada.html)

Tokyo is amazing and they're always looking for English teachers. Not something to do long term but a break with earning some cash. Housing is cheap there and so is food if you eat like Japanese do.[ Fontana Tokyo City Apartments](https://www.tokyocityapartments.net/)

The other escape is [WWOOF](https://wwoof.net/), it's working on an organic farm, free place to stay and meals in exchange for about 4 hours a work a day. Some cool places like horse farms in Canada, vineyards in France or picking pineapples in Hawaii

There are other opportunities like helping with sled dogs in Finland with an organization called [workaway](https://www.workaway.info/en/host/662294462429)

You are not an ignorant person and what you've done to date is not lost. It feels overwhelming rn, that's part of burn out. It will get better. Hang in there.",comment,26

Or maybe taking fewer courses and working part-time?

While you are young, this is the best time to educate yourself. So even if you don't pursue education in college/university, I still advise you to seek some form of training e.g. in the trades. As technology improves, jobs that once thought permanent, have been replaced.

University courses can be helpful in giving you a taste of various fields and also your own strengths/weaknesses. For example, I quickly learned that I had a strong preference for theoretical sciences as opposed to laboratory/experimental ones.",comment,9

One of my biggest regrets in life is choosing this uni and now I’m contemplating my major. I don’t know if I’ll get into the program I need to in order to even try and start my career in the future. I wish I could go back and redo it all. If you aren’t sure that uni is for you rn do what makes u happy and if u ever change ur mind u can always start uni again later.

It sounds like you are getting swamped with deadlines and are dealing with a burn-out. 

A good alternative and way to continue studying but with more freedom and less commitment is being a part-time student. It will reduce the course load by 50% (or more if you wish for it). On top of that, you can become a full-time student anytime, if you want to. Also you can consider taking a leave from the university for a year by simply dropping any courses you’re enrolled in and not paying tuition for the year. 

Me personally, I would probably switch to part-time for a year so at the very least, there’s still some academic commitment. And if I feel like I want to complete the degree, I haven’t just wasted a year not working towards it (even a little bit). If part-time still isn’t working for me, I’d opt for a year off, then ultimately decide whether the degree is worth it or not. 

Ultimately, regret is a strong feeling. If you turn away now (which is totally valid), you won’t know how you feel in a couple months regarding that decision. Hence, go slowly, if you’re strong with dropping out, take a year of absence, see how you feel after - then consider dropping out as a final decision. Else, slowly reduce the course load (maybe you find a load that works really well), then consider time off, and finally dropping out as a last resort.",comment,2

Definitely talk to a guidance councilor about this. They are good at their job in uoft. I dont think you should necessarily drop out, but instead lessen the course load to less than half of your usual. It sounds like quality of life isnt good with that course load.",comment,1
