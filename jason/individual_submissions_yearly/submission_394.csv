What can I do as a deaf guy ? Or am I doomed to be alone here at UofT ? ,TheThermalGuy,1hnqijn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hnqijn/what_can_i_do_as_a_deaf_guy_or_am_i_doomed_to_be/,1735337747.0,"Good evening mates, deaf guy here at UofT, title says it all, I am deaf from past quite sometime, and well you guessed it right communication sucks ass. personality wise I am quite social , but this deafness of mine prevents me to make connections, I already use an app for transcriptions IRL which mitigates things a bit, but that's just not it, I have been sitting at home for past 3 fucking days either reading novels, or catching up on series, but that isn't filling in the void, I got no where to go, no one to go with, I am not here to beg ppl to go with me, 

I am here to ask what do I need to improve? In your suggestions what can I do to Rectify this I am tired of this lifestyle and wanna get out of this constant abhorrent cycle of loneliness, 1st time away from a family in a new country and not anyone to talk to

Any advice is appreciated",submission,63
