"Theory: New College II was eaten by termites, and its being covered up",AJtehbest,1gknzim,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gknzim/theory_new_college_ii_was_eaten_by_termites_and/,1730859608.0,"As all New College students know, there is New College and New College III. This prompts many to wonder... what happened to New College II? My theory: termites eated it all. As many people know, termites eat wood. I believe that it is very likely that new college 2 was made out of wood, and was somehow eaten by termites. This would explain its absence. The reason why this is not known publicly is obvious: if people knew that uoft had a building get eaten by bugs, they would never stop laughing at us! Imagine what TMU students would say! It is clear to me that this has been covered up to maintain uoft's ""harvard north"" reputation. (Actual harvard has never had a building munched up by 'mites) let me know what you all think of this theory.",submission,68

College III was renamed New College III so people would only have the absence of one college to be confused by rather than two,comment,7
