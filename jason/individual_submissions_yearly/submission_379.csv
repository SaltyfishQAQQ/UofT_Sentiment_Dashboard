Why the hell are course sizes so small in upper year courses? ,Warm_House_2954,1fxx037,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fxx037/why_the_hell_are_course_sizes_so_small_in_upper/,1728266877.0,"I don’t understand why upper-year life science courses have such small class sizes. These courses are required for graduation, yet they cap them at 20 students, even when the waitlist is as large or larger than the class itself. They refuse to add more seats, and I end up taking courses I know I’ll hate, which hurts my GPA. If there’s such high demand, why not increase the class size? I'm currently on four different waitlists because these courses are not only interesting but also don’t require third-year biochem or chemistry as prerequisites.",submission,68

Smaller class sizes as you get closer to graduate. You can maybe even ask your prof for a reference. Also the cap at 20 means there is no TA so your prof has to mark everything.,comment,77

I think increasing the enrollment by 50% would have hurt everyone's experience.,comment,5
