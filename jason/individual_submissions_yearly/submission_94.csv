I saw this girl I really liked and hung out a lot with during the semester. I waved at her and she full on sprinted away, middle of downtown Toronto sprinting away. What? I didnt even yell or say anything, we just locked eyes and I waved. She just went track star, turned around and ran! Do I ask her? Is this some mating ritual at UofT? Am I supposed to physically chase after her? Is this what girls mean by ""I want a man to chase after me""?",submission,229
