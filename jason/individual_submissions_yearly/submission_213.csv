you'll kill it next sem. and if not, the sem after that. and if you never kill it? you'll still end up doing pretty great for yourself and that feeling will make it all worth it. good luck op. be kind to yourself",comment,11

Part of university is learning how you learn best and trying different things till it works. Pulling all nighters doesnâ€™t work most of the time unless you donâ€™t know anything. Take a reduced course load next semester and spend winter break thinking about what you think went wrong. 

Iâ€™m not in life sci so I canâ€™t offer advice on how to approach life sci courses. But in general, while youâ€™re writing any test, if you arenâ€™t able to answer a question, typically means that there are gaps in your understanding of the subject. 

What I find the most helpful is for any exam while studying, I get a blank piece of paper and write down all the major topics without referencing notes. Then I try to explain in my own words the major concepts of the topic without referencing any notes or external sources. I make note of what topics Iâ€™m not understanding and repeat that process till Iâ€™m able to explain it. 

The idea is that if youâ€™re not able to recall what you were taught in class or youâ€™re not able to explain it, then it probably means you didnâ€™t understand it in the first place.",comment,5

Planning plays a large part into your grades, what helped me a lot was dropping down to 4 courses each sem and doing 2 in the summer. This is a way more realistic and doable workload. Second is try to plan your courses way in advance using the uoft degree planner. That way you can try to balance out the hard courses with more birdy courses. Try to research and get the courses with the best rated profs, and your life will be a whole lot easier. Also read a book on how to study, some tips are to study as early as possible as your brain makes stronger connections when it forgets and remembers.

My marks were not competitive at all for graduate school- which was the only route possible for me if I wanted to make a decent income later on. (I specialized in psychology). I mean my marks were pretty bad- so for those of you who deny that my options aren't THAT limited- they really were. 

Here's my advice from an actual dropout. 

You feel alone at university. Haven't made friends. And you say that you have been depressed for the past few months. And you can't tell your parents. Something I know all too well. 

This recipe is NOT good. And if you are going further into dept. I would highly consider changing routes. Is Uoft farther from your home? Commuting is a btich. I should have gone to my local schools.  I would have made lots of friends AND would have lived near them. 

Is college... really that bad? College may allow you to invest your time much better. Lots of great programs that eventually lead to a job.

It's smart to accept- that their is something wrong with your current trajectory (for some very valid reasons.) Don't do what I did. Which was be in denial- and think that more effort = better results - and later on it would be worth it. Not true in my case. I suffered from mental health issues- which now I am being medicated for. AND i've been doing a lot of reflection lately. My study habits were abysmal. My routines were abysmal. My mental health was NOT good at all. All of which is necessary in order to succeed in University. 

DM me if you have any more questions or just want to talk.",comment,6

This does not mean you are dumb. Please reach out to mental health services on campus. You are not alone in your struggles and your first semester grades do not define you. In my first year, I almost failed CHM135 and failed CSC108. I ended up graduating with high distinction and last week was admitted to law school at UofT. I know many more similar stories. Take some time to relax over the break. When you are in a better headspace consider reflecting on the semester and how you think you can improve.

The company of other people is agreeable, but how would this have helped with your study of chemistry? Only you can answer this. It is a common enough story that students cannot master chemistry, but they usually explain it in terms of not being interested, not understanding the maths, lacking a suitable foundation etc.

What seems clear is that your study habits must change, or you face disaster. Be ruthless with yourself. At a minimum, cut out the all-nighters, and find the study time in other ways. As an aid, make a diary for the week in which you (a) plan study periods; (b) note honestly how you actually spent the time. For example, coffee, snack or smoke breaks can consume an enormous amount of time in the day, if you let them. Other thieves of time are: romantic daydreams, checking email/phone for messages, and giving ""quick"" replies, looking at one's face or figure in the mirror.",comment,1

either way, you're nervous for nothing! look up the majors you're interested in and see if they're limited enrolment or open enrolment (all on uoft's website). open enrolment you have a 100% chance of getting in. if you reallyyyy want a limited enrolment one, you might need to redo some courses for the targeted grade, or just opt for a minor in the subject/a related area instead! a minor typically has less intense criteria. if you're still confused, call your registrar or feel free to pm me if you have more questions :)",comment,3
