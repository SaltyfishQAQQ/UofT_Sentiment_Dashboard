Gap year after graduating.  Couldn't find a job related to the field, had to pick up a debt collector job.  Maybe 40k?  Miserable year.  Then went on to dental school.  Most of my classmates went on to grad school but I hated research.  Imo this degree is as helpful as any other generic bachelor's degree unless you use it to study more.",comment,34

But I took a year off after grad, went back to Asia and visit, and got a random job in one of the Fortune 500 tech manufacturing companies last year and I changed my mind. Now I’m back to GTA and working in a traditional manufacturing company and my starting salary is about $55k. Also looking for a side job. But there are def more opportunities outside of the psych field.",comment,2

Maybe after a few years the pay off would be worth it right?  Nope.  Research especially in medicine now is sooooo incremental.  Most new findings are something like this treatment has a small effect with respect to this outcome, ah maybe, maybe not, the sample is always too small, additional investigation is always needed.  It feels like holding in your pee but finding out the bathroom is actually just a hole in the ground.  And then you remember you have benign prostate hyperplasia and now you have to pee again.  I've gotten published before, I don't get that euphoric feeling some people get from seeing their names in the journals.  I just don't care.",comment,3
