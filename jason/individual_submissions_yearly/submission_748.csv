- If your grade on Acorn is 60 or above, that is your final grade and should be correct.
- If it appears that your final EXAM grade is 0%, and youâ€™re only seeing the term grade on Acorn (i.e. Out of 60%), then it is because there were issues where they werenâ€™t able to match the exam to the proper student account on Acorn. This issue should be resolved soon. The administrative and instructional team is working on resolving this as soon as possible, but there are quite a few students who have this issue, so a timeline is NOT given and could take a few days.",comment,2
