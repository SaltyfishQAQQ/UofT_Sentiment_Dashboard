Or like a missed connections page? I'll post here but if it's not the right place pls forgive meeee This is so embarrassing but I'm trying to find this one guy I went on a date with like around 2014 and literally never saw again. We had a 1st year class together in [St.George](http://St.George), hung out once, and I CANNOT FIND HIM. 

I changed my number, fell off social media and just got busy with life, but I still think about this dude sometimes, he was pretty cute. Can't help but think there might have been a missed connection there somewhere. Also, embarrassing at it is, I completely forgot his name (I was a dumb froshie, plsssss) so I'll give a little description and hopefully we can track him down. 

So we had a 2014 1st year class about the Roma people, the prof was Christina Kramer (yeah I remember her name but not his, I know), it was in St. George downtown Toronto. You asked me out for coffee as I was hauling my books to the bookstore to return at the end of the semester. Super tall, Caucasian, used to be a carpenter. I'm a somewhat tall brown girl with black hair and glasses. (ok this sounds like a police sketch) 

Your name started with a G for sure, maybe Grantt or Garett? We hung out once over the summer where we did get coffee and kinda just sat on the grass and talked, then went to an empty classroom and talked some more. It was really nice. Idk why I kinda freaked out, I liked you but just kinda talked myself out of hanging out again cuz idk I was a shy froshie or some sh\*t. I remember once there were Earthquakes in my home country around this summer and you called and left a voicemail asking if my family was ok. Idk, that random act of kindness really stuck with me. Anyways, if you're out there, hit me up. U of T pls do your job, you've given me so much trauma, now do something good for onceeeeeeee k thx bye",submission,84
