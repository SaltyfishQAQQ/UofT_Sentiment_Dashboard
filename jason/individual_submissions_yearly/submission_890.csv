I was a loser when I was in high school and I dont want to have my university years replicating that. I realized now that I dont have the best social skills but I'm trying to work on them. Also I'm commuting (until I find a place to stay)  and I know I'm going to be out more often so I might need someone to stay with. Does anyone have any advice on how to make friends as school starts please and thank you. ,submission,17

You'll be super busy with your classes (and classmates) and in your spare time you should join clubs! If there's an activity you love, like skiing or debate, join that club. If there's a sport you're really into, find out when try outs are for the Varsity team. Go to the gym -- the AC, Hart House or Goldring depending on your preference. So many people to meet there! Engage in your college's frosh activities. If you identify as a minority or have affiliations to a particular country, they probably have a club as well. There's a clubs fair tomorrow (I think) on front campus! The next few weeks will be so exciting for you and you'll meet so many new people. Don't be intimidated but use your best judgement. Being present is the most important thing! Best wishes!!",comment,1

Then when you make the team and you automatically make 45 friends.

Are you excited to learn about (today's topic)? I can't wait (say in a sarcastic tone) (also judge if they want to have a convo by their response).

I'm frosty by the way. Are you taking this class as a program requirement or just for fun?

Cool! I'm taking it for (X). What do you plan to do with it? Do you want to pursue a major in (Y)?

Did you want to chat some more later/did you want to sit with each other during class/do you want to exchange socials? This class has a reputation of being pretty brutal.""
