I spent almost 12 consecutive hours (skipped breakfast and lectures) on a MAT247 assignment (hw4) for some reason as I only looked through the questions the day before it was due. Somehow got a 100% in that, but that was an absolute nightmare and I hope this never happens to me again.",comment,48

My most intense was a full-day study session that went from 12pm - 6:30 a.m. for an econ midterm I had that same day at 9 a.m. Safe to say I will not be doing a repeat of that,comment,24

I skipped practically everything, from meals to breaks, showers excluded. The horribly low class average was my motivator. I aced that course. 

Though, I’d never do it again. I’ve never felt my brain as tired and numb as it was on that fourth day after the exam. It could not have been healthy in the least. ",comment,15

Somehow, despite understanding basically nothing in the class, I got nearly 100% on the exam. This was total random luck as it was a poorly designed exam obviously, and did not measure true knowledge, of which I had almost none (but I knew enough of the vocab to answer the MC questions right apparently). My friend in the class got slammed on that exam and he actually ended up becoming a successful accountant in life. I went into health sciences. I do not recommend this study method lol",comment,11

Those usually only happen after you’ve been procrastinating for too long.

I personally start early, and sometimes, super early. I’m taking a course on a topic next semester, but I already have my outline for research paper ready, with the topic and major sources that I plan on using.",comment,20

He decided he wasn't going to fork over a single dime, and somehow managed to convince uoft to slam out his entire 4th year of CS over his 3rd year summer. This would include bouncing between UTM, St George, and Scrarb. campus, multiple times a day, to courses moving at light speed


He made it through. Pretty sure he even made it into grad school",comment,4

In all honesty though! Dont be too hard on yourself OP, slow and steady studying works and cramming works-ish too. You wont know how much time you should spend on something because every one is different - different social circumstances, financial troubles, family issues, intelligence and ability, maybe the course is different that year. I know you're asking out of curiosity but still, watch the subconscious effects and manage it!",comment,3
