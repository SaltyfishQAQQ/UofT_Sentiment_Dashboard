Is that the extent of your analysis?

My analysis is that student groups in North America tend to be well educated and thoughtful young people who tend to skew more progressive and human-rights oriented. History shows a long list of student demonstrations being villified in their time, only to be vindicated by time. 

Assessment of the situation in the Middle East shows that, regardless of Hamas' crimes towards Israel, Gazans are suffering disproportionately, and that suffering is being primarily enacted by the Israeli state, whose leaders are on record openly inciting genocide and ethnic cleansing, and whose armies appear to be following through on those stated goals. Israel's actions, particularly the killing of journalists, aid workers, and attempts to de-legitimize international humanitarian and legal organizations, threaten global stability and peace, signalling that they believe they are immune to external scrutiny, i.e. above international norms and law.

The fact that Israel is openly defying the ICC and [threatening more repression against Palestinians if the ICC serves warrants to Israeli leaders](https://www.axios.com/2024/05/01/us-israel-palestinian-authority-icc-arrest-warrant) should be more than enough proof at this point that Israel is a rogue state and a threat to global order.",comment,53

I think the right way is for any protest to clearly denounce Hamas from the start to reduce any chance of your protest being co-opted by right wing extremists, and allow it to focus on the goal of peace for people in the region. There should be no rhetoric to suggest the goal is revenge or anything like that.

You can look into a group called Standing Together who are Israelis and Arab-Israelis protesting settlers, destruction in Gaza *and* hostage release. Their colours are purple, and their message is unifying and peaceful. I just think most people are more receptive and supportive of this. From what I have seen, that is more akin to my 'right' way of protest.

I also think the UofT protesters need to be much more clear on their demands. They've used a lot of big financey words to demand divestment, but what does that actually mean. ""Direct and indirect investments that support Israeli apartheid"" - what does this mean? Weapons manufacturers? Sure, I can see that. Globally diversified ETF that happens to have an Israeli pharmaceutical company within its holdings? Ridiculous.

Who is the person who is going to vet the universities financial holdings after they have been given access to them and make the decision on what has to be cut? A first year econ student from the camp? An independent regulator?

Ultimately, this is my first ever comment on this conflict because it is incredibly complex and I just don't know enough. Unfortunately, I would guess that 95% of participants who are vehemently on either side are the same, they just like the protest-core aesthetic and are deep down a social media rabbit hole one way or the other.",comment,14

The campus, particularly in the downtown area, includes public spaces that are often utilized by both the university community and the general public.

While the university owns much of the land and buildings on its campuses, it is also subject to various municipal regulations and agreements. In the case of the University of Toronto's downtown campus, there are likely agreements or understandings with the municipal government regarding the use and maintenance of public spaces.

For example, areas such as parks, walkways, and other open spaces on the campus may be subject to city bylaws and regulations governing public spaces. Additionally, the university may work closely with city officials to ensure the proper management and accessibility of these public areas.""",comment,2

Straight from Wikipedia - 

>From 2016 to 2019, Israel allocated over $100 million in funding to counter BDS, which it considers a strategic threat.[236] In 2016, Israel's ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, stated that Israel was in many countries ""so that it will simply be illegal to boycott Israel.""[245] In 2020, it was revealed that an Israeli state-funded lobby group had been instrumental in pushing for anti-BDS laws in many U.S. states.[17]

Hmm, making it ""illegal to boycott Israel"" and spending $100+ million to prop up advocacy groups and spy organizations doesn't really seem like it's about fighting anti-semitism, and claiming it's anti-semitic to not economically support Israel is a pretty silly argument to make.",comment,12

Its a common opinion amongst protesters that go beyond removing settlements at the West Bank, allowing aid in Gaza and stopping civilian deaths. 

I think we can all agree that what Israel is doing is awful and goes beyond defending themselves. However, I don't agree with the elements of Hamas sympathy, the eradication of Israel (it exist, it cannot be undone), the Marxist-Leninist agenda pushing (its so disingenuous to be promoting fringe economic systems or to even couch Palestinian freedoms under that lens to simply push an agenda) and the anti-semitism that permeates these protests.

There are two main branches of support the protestors want UofT to withdraw. One is financial; the other is mainly normative. 

The financial ""branch"" is that UofT, like all universities has a sizeable endowment fund that is invested into myriad companies. Israel is pretty integrated into the Western economy, so unless you're making a concerted effort to avoid investments into Israel, it's likely that you're invested. That's not even to mention the cushy relationship UofT has historically had with Israel, further increasing the likelihood of substantial investments in Israel. The students want UofT to end these investments. 

The normative branch is UofT's academic involvement with Israeli universities (exchange programs, for example). The students also want UofT to end these relationships. The normative value of this is a clear communication that UofT is unwilling to treat Israel, and its universities, as responsible members of the international community.",comment,2

First of all, Israel was created for one reason only, and that's because of antisemitic oppression in Europe. Apartheid in South Africa was truly an ideology of white supremacy. Zionism is the opposite -- a movement that says Jews have a right to self-determination in the face of hundreds of years of pogroms and other serious forms of oppression. See the difference?

In the 60s, when it became clear to the Soviets that Israel was not going to be in their sphere of influence, they started pumping out their own made-up definition of Zionism as a strawman for everything bad in the world. You have absorbed those lies. 

When Hamas got their hands on some actual Jews they murdered everyone they saw. They drove nails into women's vaginas and thighs and raped women on flatbed trucks who were already half dead. In South Africa, black and white people always lived together, so this was just a change in government and policy. 

Do you really think the 6 million Jews who currently live on the land would be allowed to continue living if Israel were destroyed? I can assure you the Israelis don't think so, and they will do whatever it takes to keep living.

Sure, it's an assertion that Jews have the right to self-determination in their state, but that state is situated on land that was stolen from its existing inhabitants. 

In effect, Zionism is the belief that Jews, and Jews *alone*, have the right to self-determination over land that, historically, has been home to many people aside from Jews. This is pretty similar to the South African belief that only White South Africans had a right to self-determination over the country. 

Israel's Apartheid system is not identical to South Africa's, considering Arab Israelis do have the franchise and relatively comparable civil rights to their Jewish Israeli compatriots.

If you study international law you should know two things about this conflict that void your arguments.

Their legitimacy is completely under the bar. This means it is not even a war. War is between two states. This is another ‚Äúwar on terrorism‚Äù (reminiscent of US violations in Iraq and Afghanistan, remember those?).

Proving intent in a case of genocide is either extremely easy like in Rwanda or very hard like in Israel where civilian casualties are 1. Not accurately reported by hamas and 2. Hamas soldiers wear civilian clothing so they are reported as civilians and 3. The amount of casualties in 8 months of ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù is extremely low if Israel had actual intent for it, it would be somewhere in the hundreds of thousands. The fact that Gaza is one of the most densely populated areas in the world makes it so easy to  actually commit genocide if one wanted to, and not drop leaflets and warn people of incoming bombs so they can save their lives.",comment,2

The mass displacement you speak of is necessary and temporary for the time being as Israel wants civilians out of areas where they suspect Hamas to be, its not anywhere near to what 1948 was for Palestinians but its for their safety so this wouldn't be considered to be cultural cleansing or genocide. There is also no intent to commit cultural genocide as cultural heritages can be destroyed for a multitude of reasons in a war zone ie Hamas loves to hide in places where they think Israel is unlikely to strike like hospitals (proven), near schools (IDF found tunnel entrances) and places of worship (unbiased and greatly reliable source based on Ad fontes media analysis: https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-cemetery-mosque-tunnel-idf-fb609916b0d5251ea6f7c0ea2a2c2b3f).",comment,1
