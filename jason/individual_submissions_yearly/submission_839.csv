What that will mean is you may have to talk to the registrars office of your faculty to get approval.",comment,13

Explanation in comments,deleted,lrmk12d,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g2a2k9/can_i_attend_an_online_lecture_while_enrolled_in/lrmk12d/,1728768155.0,"I'm a commuter who usually bikes to class, which takes about 30 minutes. When I set up my courses for winter, there was unfortunately no better option for me than to sign up for a 1 hour MAT223 lecture on Friday. This would mean I would have to bike 30 minutes, attend a one our lecture, and then bike another 30 minutes back. Just a big waste of time.

Now I'm aware that you can simply attend a different lecture if you wanted to, but can you attend an online lecture you're not enrolled in? It's really the best option for me because all of the other lectures have 1 hour on Fridays.

So like, can I just ask for the zoom link? Or is this not possible?",comment,16

I assume that you meant mat223 in your drawing and not mat137, so in that case yes. I'm in mat223 right now and all sections share the same Quercus page, and the Zoom link for the online section is posted for everybody to use if they want. The online section prof also always posts a recording of her class right after, so technically you could never attend class and just watch the recordings (I don't recommend that approach, just saying it's possible).",comment,6
