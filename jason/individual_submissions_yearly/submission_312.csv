If this is your first year in, you have only gotten to 4 weeks.

When I was at your place, 4 weeks in, I thought everything looked nice. The weather was that of the warm early fall, me getting to know the guys in tutorial, hanging out on Spadina. Shit was good. I loved the Brown fries truck every time I finish tutorial in SS. Getting McD and Tim Horton after lecture in OI. Taking TTC and GO everywhere, went to Niagara for the first time in my first five weeks in.

Then the midterm came.

Then the essays

Then more essays

Then the winter and early sunsets

Then more work

More essays

More exams

More more more issues and problems

Ruined my sleep schedule too, lived in UC dorm first year which the heaters work 24/7 and can‚Äôt turn off, the room average is a consistent 28 C degree. Never slept in night for weeks straight because how hot it gets in bed.

Everything went downhill since
