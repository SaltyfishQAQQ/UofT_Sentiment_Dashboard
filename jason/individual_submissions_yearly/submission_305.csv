He added 6 raw points to everyone's exam scores- that is a curve. ""The overall average course mark was a 70% with a median of 71%"" (His quercus announcement). Yea, that was the hardest exam I have taken so far, but he needed to lower the overall grades, so that it's fair for the vellekoop students. He gave us a heads up multiple times that the final exam was going to be extra hard. It is what it is. 

He's a new prof, so he's still struggling to adjust the difficulty of his tests according to the other profs teaching the course. He's not the best prof out there, but I would say what he did was fair.",comment,16

Sure they can make exams as hard as they want, but that also means that everyone will have to deal with a harder exam. At the end of the day, to do well in UofT you simply have to do better than others. 

Grades will always be adjusted to (generally) at least a C+/B-, either artificially through grade boosts/positive curves, and/or by changing difficulties of subsequent assessments to compensate for averages in prior assessments. So, if say the first midterm or 2 had a very high average (for e.g. somewhere in the 80s), definitely expect that the final exam will be hard enough that the average is somewhere in the 50s. This means that even if you do well in the first assessments but only by getting the average mark, unless you still tried to improve drastically, relative to your peers that is, such that you do much better in the final than the others, you will end up with an average grade. Your goal is to always do better than the average, and your final grade will reflect that. If the averages are in the 40s, then getting 50s or 60s will net you 80s and 90s as a final grade. If the averages are in the 80s or 90s, then getting 80s or 90s, although being very high marks, will likely net you 60s or 70s as a final grade.

You are actively being weeded out at this stage. Being better than average consistently is the only way to get a final mark that is better than average.",comment,9

(Digression: Grade inflation in the Canadian highschool system has gone too far, to the point that universities can't really select students based on their grades. In Asian countries, high school averages in the 80s are unheard of, and people actually laugh at the Canadian high school system for being such a joke.) U of T's goal is to weed out the weaklings so that the remaining students are on par with students from other elite universities. E.g. the first test class average for my PHY131 (many years ago) was 33. Class size dropped from ~1000 to 200s the next day, and by the end of the course it dropped to 100s.

Example: a ""B"" is supposed to be average, thats the original definition of the grade, so ideally UofT targets most courses to have around a B average. If the average is too high going into an exam, the idea is that the grading scheme was too forgiving since if a B is supposed to be average, then either the content was too easy or the grading was too lenient. To normalize, they will give you an ass spanking hard exam. The same sometimes occurs the other way, where if a class average is too low, theyll give a linear adjustment upwards.

The issue is, most schools have gone through a period of hyper grade inflation, but UofT hasnt, so in comparison it looks and feels very unfair. The reality is that most students are supposed to get a B, and the exceptional ones are supposed to get an A.

Folks coming from Ontario highschools will be dumbstruck by this idea, since the entire grading schema has become completely devalued in Ontario highschools where they give basically everyone an A for bare minimum work, with a few people getting Bs and Cs.

My sister (6 yrs younger) and I (currently at U of T) went to the same high school and the difference is day and night.

London Central Secondary School used to be a nonsemestered school offering Locally Developed, Applied and Academic stream courses with 1st Year Uni equivalent Advanced Placement courses for 12th grade (I tested out of ENGA01 in uni this way :'D)

However, following Covid, a lot of parents were Big Mad that the school didn't curve their grades + their kids finished with 50s/60s so they petitioned the city council to semester the high-school and merge all education streams

Mind you: other than chemistry (40 avg 🤪) every other course was simple enough to get an A in. Simple as in straightforward, not easy

I strongly feel like the only reason I've been able to keep up an A to B steak at Uni is because after the unsemestered academic 8-course workload, 4 to 6 Uni courses per term is less stress (comparatively)

However I know my sister isn't getting that same leg up due to both courses becoming easier + school policy changes. She's doing amazingly well but at the same time the differences in our homework for that time is wild

So I feel like this kind of difficulty reduction  and grade inflation Is just gonna screw kids wanting to get into high level academic institutions",comment,5

If this has ever been the case for a course then that course is for sure the exception. (Source: I am a TA). How would a TA even do something like that for an exam? There is a mark scheme to abide by. The most input I've ever been given regarding how to mark (besides being provided the mark scheme ofcourse) has been to be less or more lenient with how to give out part marks (with the latter being generally the case). Never once have I heard of a case where a TA was told to explicitly try and maintain a specific average when marking. I don't even know how one would attain this given that there would be multiple TAs all marking different subsets of papers, and who will undoubtedly come across papers/exams of varying qualities. What having an explicit average to abide by would imply is that I would have to somehow need to consistently take into account what grades I've already given out, what grades others have given out, how to adjust my marking accordingly, and how to avoid bias assuming I started off marking objectively but realizing people have done ""too well"" meaning I would need to somehow go back and readjust the grades again (which believe me no one has the time to do)",comment,10

Something something irony in that to *actually* improve your level you need to be highly aware of where your skills stand amongst everyone else, and then note that your skill level =/= your worth. Everyone has worth and that's tied to *who* you are; not everyone has the same skills, and that's tied to *what you can do.* 

Admin has conflated worth and ability to a dangerous degree right now, which is what I think leads to such mitigating attitudes like ""everyone is a winner."" Like they've tied academic ability to worth, to self esteem, etc. If people can learn to separate the two then I wager they end up doing better, given the dropped stress rates now that how valued of a person you are doesn't matter on your *grades.* 

This also means that when you lose, it's no big deal. If you've done your best, then there's realistically nothing better you could have done--best turn that energy into rewarding a good effort and planning future improvement. Recognizing people are better than you + not hating them for it is something they keep refusing to teach 

I feel like it feeds into students not caring, too. If everyone passes, what's the point of trying for a good mark? etc. It's some nasty, nasty logic trap",comment,4
