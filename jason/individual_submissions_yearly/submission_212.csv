Due to considerations of Freedom of Expression, the judge will allow the protestors to remain on the lawn. However, he will require the removal of the fencing and mandate that they cannot prevent others from using the space.

Another core argument by the university is that despite *the University of Toronto Act stating explicitly that the university does not own the land as private property* 1) it never clarifies who owns the property 2) and also gives the university limited ability to govern activity. 
*from a layman understanding the university this morning argued that since no one else owns the property at a higher capacity than the university then the university indeed essentially owns it as private property* 
- this was a very strange and entertaining way to start the case. 

In case you’re curious, highlight of the morning was when the judge asked to clarify and asked along the lines of: “so if someone says ‘mother bought an apple pie’ and trespasses, it is unlawful because they are saying that while trespassing. Is that the university’s position?”
- btw he said “trespassing” referring to the university’s vaguely proposed definition of trespassing, not confirming it /was/ trespassing 
- and to clarify the judge said this in good faith, because the university claimed one student acknowledges that “globalize the intifada” is not violent in nature but that when she sees signs saying “globalize the intifada” she assumes it means the encampment supports the killing of jews like Hamas. The university admits the message is non violent but “[student name I am redacting] has rights to her feelings” 
- I.e. subjective extrapolation of messaging was argued as a valid argument 

IMO trying to say that they functionally own the legally-not-private property as private property because who else owns it then? was a very weak way to start (I was laughing)",comment,23

I don’t want this to be a country where a group pounding their fists and occupying private land gets their way just bc they want it. That’s not how democracy works, and it really pains me to see university educated individuals not understanding the difference between legal rights to protest and civil disobedience. If you are civilly disobedient, don’t be so surprised when you get charged criminally. I support a Palestinian state. I don’t support bullying people into agreeing with my views. This is why we have parliament and democracy people. Advocate and make yourselves heard. HOWEVER, everyone in the fkn world knows what’s happening. You aren’t bringing awareness anymore, you’re just bringing animosity, 


Was it wrong when the ‘freedom convoy’ started their encampment? Should we move the goal posts when we agree with one cause but not another…? Law and order exist for a reason, they shouldn’t be bent to fit what the ‘morally correct’ flavour of the day is. Time and time again we learn more about things as they progress. Short term tantrums by small groups shouldn’t dictate long term social mechanisms by this country’s institutions. Let democracy and democratic institutions operate without the threat of physical occupation. 


People are gonna hate the logic on this one, and call me an apartheid supporter, Zionist, bootlicker etc etc etc….. but re-read my message. This is about upholding our own values as a democracy. Illegal protests are illegal and will be dealt with according to the law. There shouldn’t be two ways around it.",comment,-13

As such, hypothetical ""vulnerability"" could be overcome by suggesting that the protestors leave at night. Moreover, there are numerous security personnel on site and other security measures that have been in place for weeks (e.g., floodlights, CCTV).

Most importantly, though, the potential vulnerability of one side does not supersede the freedom of expression and access of the other side.

While I don't believe that the judge will rule in favour of removal of the protestors, I do think that the protestors' use of the fencing to prevent public access will be struck down.

Such a compromise would not be entirely satisfactory to either party, but would satisfy the core argument of both sides.",comment,-1

The protestors are asking for the school to end all academic ties with Israel, which is an immediate non-starter. They aren’t protesting to end the genocide, they’re protesting the school for being a school who makes investments and demanding that they get all the school’s financial documents… 


Good job tho trying to equate this in any way shape or form to the CIVIL RIGHTS movement of CIVIL AMERICANS about AMERICAN ACTION… the human rights of another place being attacked by another country in which there are schools and businesses which a school invests in… not at all the same as Black Americans being directly murdered and mistreated by their elected officials. While what is happening is not right, it’s also a LOT more nuanced. Like for instance, wouldn’t the Palestinian people have been considered occupiers of Israel after having been exiled…? And why did the Arab league attack the new Jewish nation in 1948 despite the fact that the area was already conquered and owned by the Ottomans and then the British?

• prevention of invited talks given by UofT faculty at Israeli universities
• while we encourage individual faculty and grad students to withdraw from working in or with the Israeli academy, we support academic freedom and are not calling upon UofT administration to restrict the movement of individual scholars

WE ARE CALLING FOR:
• the severance of all institutional partnerships between UofT and complicit Israeli academic institutions
• UofT to adhere to its own policies--the school has existing procedures in place for the regulation of international partnerships in accordance with human rights
• UofT's Institutional Cooperation Policy (1982), Procedures for the Human Rights Review of International Projects, Agreements, and Other International Activity (1993), and Statement on Research Partnerships (2007)

Two examples of complicit universities
• Hebrew University of Jerusalem
operates in illegally occupied East Jerusalem and in Palestinian villages that were ethnically cleansed
• is in the process of opening an lOF military base on campus
• Technion - Israel Institute of Technology. o has a military research institute that develops armed bulldozers used in demolishing

No, there is no law forbidding this. Please cite your sources or you're just spreading misinformation at this point. 

[Marriage is a religious institution in Israel and governed by the religious bodies there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriage_in_Israel?useskin=vector#cite_ref-mfa_2-1). In Israel, few religious bodies allow Jews to marry Muslims or Christians. Similarly, very few masjids allow Muslims to marry Jews or Christians, and very few churches allow Christians to marry Jews or Muslims. Inter-faith marriages without conversion are frowned upon in that entire region and Israel is no exception to that. It's in the Torah, the Quran and the Bible, it's not an exclusively Israeli thing like you're trying to make it out to be.

>Only Jews are allowed to live in certain areas, especially in areas under Israeli administration outside the Green Line like the illegal settlements.

Again, no sources to back this up. There are no laws forbidding Arab Israeli citizens from [living in Area C](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Bank_areas_in_the_Oslo_II_Accord?useskin=vector) afaik. If you are talking about housing discrimination against Arab Israelis in general, yes that's a thing, but again as I mentioned in my previous comment housing is controlled by private entities and NGOs, not the government.

>Jewish citizens can become citizens automatically under the Law of Return if they immigrate, but this doesn't apply to Arab citizens

LOL what. The right of return is meant for Jewish NON-citizens, not existing Israeli citizens. It is supposed to grant citizenship to Jews across the world who are fleeing oppression in their home countries, particularly Arab nations that used to have Jewish minorities. It's no different than refugee programs other countries hold, just with expedited citizenship processes. This applies to Arab Jews just as equally as it applies to non-Arab Jews. If your argument is ""why don't they grant that same right to 475 million non-Jewish Arabs"" then you really need to work on your critical thinking skills if you want to make it out of UofT bud.",comment,1

Actually, this is not true. Off the top of my head, here is a list of other democracies that forbid interfaith marriage.

* Malaysia
* Bangladesh
* Pakistan
* Senegal

An astute reader such as yourself may notice a trend here amongst these countries :)

Certainly not, my defence is pointing out that there is no actual law in Israel that forbids interfaith marriages, unlike the Muslim democracies I pointed out above that DO restrict them by law.

You can keep focusing on your incorrect fallacy definitions, it's very telling.

I literally haven't shielded anything from anyone.  You and the students are against ethnostates.  I agree Israel is an ethnostate.

You haven't answered or addressed any of my points.  You keep talking in circles hoping I'll get confused or give up.  Neither will happen.

This is just like the students at the encampment itself, they cannot answer any questions that actually challenge them on their stance and when they are required to think outside of the talking points, they go back to nonsense buzz words.

I'm not saying either of those things.  Israel is an ethnostate.  I disagree ethnostates are inherently bad.  With those two things being said, I cannot be doing whatboutism.

Again, the irony that is lost on you is that YOU are doing whataboutism.


You:  Ethnostates shouldn't exist and are bad.


Me:  I disagree, they are not inherently bad and their existence is not black and white.  There are many ethnostates around the world and many of them are muslim.  There are no protests about those ones.  Can you tell me why those ones are good and Israel is bad?


You:  Whataboutism!!!

Maybe if you think ethnostates and their policies are bad, you can come out and clearly state that ALL ethnostates are bad.  Surely you'd agree with that, right?  All ethnostates are bad?",comment,1
