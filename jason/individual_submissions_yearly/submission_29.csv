Also, the [living wage](https://www.ontariolivingwage.ca/rates) for the GTA is $25.05/hour, or around 46k a year. Even if you take their calculation for housing (which assumes no roommates) and cut it in half, the total is around 36k a year. So the new base funding is still 5k below a fairly conservative living wage.

I'm definitely glad for the departments who will feel this change the most (it's insane they were paying people 11k??), it's a good step. But at the end of the day there's still more work to do to make the PhD financially equitable",comment,21

It's a job. And all jobs are supposed to pay enough to feed you. Work is work and deserves to be compensated with a livable wage. 

Also to clarify on TA hours, as someone already mentioned, the university mandates that around 7500 of our base funding (now 31k) is covered by TA and CI work. What that means is that a graduate student has to work at least around 150 hours as a TA before they can start earning more money beyond the base funding package. So if you need to earn more money, you have to bust your ass to try to get multiple TAships, which is easier said than done depending on what field you're in.",comment,6

I know 2 people with kids that are raising them part time (on a shared ~80k salary cause its 2 PhD students) and they are doing alright.

Yes things would be better if the pay is higher.  But this 40k base funding (even with the 120-150 TA hours it includes) is totally manageable.  And there are extra hours available (whether you do private tutoring or scavenge for extra TA hours).

And while yes grad school “is a job” its a weird one.  You are there to develop yourself creatively in the academic field you are studying in.  That differs from traditional jobs where the goal is to make something that makes money.  You cant really bucket them together the same.
