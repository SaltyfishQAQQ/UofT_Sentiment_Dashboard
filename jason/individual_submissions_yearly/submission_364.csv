If you're 2nd year and want a waiver it doesn't mean it'll be denied but.... Priority goes to 4th year, then 3rd, etc etc....

It's ultimately up to the prof if they want an extra student BUT I have never been denied a waiver. I used them like 6 times. Maybe 8 actually, as grad approached.

If it's a big but required class? Hahaha just ask and ye shall receive. No issues at all.
