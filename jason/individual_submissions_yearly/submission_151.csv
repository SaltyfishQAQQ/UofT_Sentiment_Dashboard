In case you want to find out more, here’s the [source (A Statement from the Editorial Board of IHRP - no paywall)](https://ihrp.law.utoronto.ca/statement-editorial-board):

> At the time, the Editorial Board expressed alarm over what these events revealed: improper donor influence, judicial impropriety, and the Palestinian exception to academic freedom. In the following months, we then saw the University administration continually shirk accountability for its misconduct and brush aside the historic academic censure of the University imposed by the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT).


> On September 17, 2021, it was announced that Dr. Azarova had been re-offered the Director position, though she ultimately declined. This development is a direct result of the organized labour and collective action of academics around the world. However, while the CAUT has temporarily suspended the censure in response, it has yet to be lifted entirely.",comment,5
