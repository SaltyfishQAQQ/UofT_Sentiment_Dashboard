Would you say the Palestinians are perpetual victims? They've screwed up literally every possible opportunity that was handed to them.

Rejected the UNSCOP Partition Plan. Provoked a civil war and lost. Launched Fedayeen attacks from surrounding independent Arab states on civilian communities. Kicked out from Jordan for trying to overthrow the King. Helped pull Lebanon into a civil war. Provoked the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Allied with Saddam Hussein after his invasion of Kuwait. Got kicked out from Kuwait. Launch an attack on civilian communities on Oct 7th, capture hostages. Gaza gets destroyed. 

Today the world begs for a two state solution where Palestinians get a fraction of what the UN allocated in 1947. Even today Palestinians won't admit to their mistakes or wrong doing.

How is rejecting an offer 75 years ago, and begging for a shit tier one now, a great victory?

Arab majority areas in border regions of Israel like parts of the West Bank become part of Jordan. Jordan administers them since the majority of Jordanians identify as having Palestinian roots. Jordan is essentially historic Palestine. 

Jordan makes these areas a province or state of Palestine. Federally Jordan runs it, state or provincially Palestinians have some autonomy.
