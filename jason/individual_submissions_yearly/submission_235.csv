Regarding All The Doomer/Venting Posts I've Been Seeing In This Subreddit ,Skates_Psyched,1feaziq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1feaziq/regarding_all_the_doomerventing_posts_ive_been/,1726063587.0,"I've been seeing a lot of venting posts from Frist year students being ""checked"" really hard by the workload, lifestyle change, and basic realities of being completely independent for the first time. While those people are valid to feel those things, I'd like to offer an alternative experience to the majority being shared on this sub-reddit. 

I am also a first year student (wanting to major math and also minor in french and computer science). However, I am not 17/18. I am turning 22 this year. I previously went to Sheridan college to get a 2 year (accelerated into 1.3 years) diploma for computer programming. I then worked as a software developer for TD Bank for a year. Obviously, since I'm going back to school, I didn't find what fulfilled me, so I applied to UofT and (somehow) got in. 

*Side note: I believe I got in because (from what I understand) UofT accepts lots of applications with the hopes that people will dropout. I'm not sure. If someone can confirm or deny this, I'm curious*

Anyways, I'm here now. I've made an active effort in meeting new people (as an introvert) (by going to orientation, talking to the people around me in class, giving compliments to random people, etc.) and try to make the best out of my university experience (by fully engaging in my classes and developing a studying schedule *so far*). 

Needless to say, I'm not disappointed or burntout from my courses this far due to taking precautions (like only taking 2.0 credits in this fall semester and having realistic expectations of myself in my courses and making friends that will help me study and stay on track). 

My courses are very hard (for me). Specifically MAT 137. I don't yet understand most of the key concepts being taught, but I believe I will with enough effort. I'm studying most of my time when I'm not socializing with my new friends or pending time with my girlfriend or family. 

I think the key thing that separates someone that vents on Reddit and me (who is generally having a good, although stressful, experience) is ""purpose"". 

That might sound like bullsh*t, but hear me out...

The reason I don't mind doing these things and putting all my effort into it is because my values/purpose align with my actions. I understand FULLY the feeling of burnout and wanting to give up. I had that at my job when I worked at TD Bank and a software engineer. I understand...

To reitterate, the difference likely originates from a few places I've touched on:
- having unrealistic expectations of yourself in your courses
- not making an effort to socialize 
- not having a purpose that drives you to keep going and study more

For me, that purpose is to become a highschool teacher. I want to help as many people in the teenage years of someone's life just as my teachers have done the same with me in the past. 

Because of this, do you think I am anxious that I don fully understand a topic the first time around? No. Ultimately, what matters is that I learn as much as I can of what I don't know, and I get a degree so that I can start teaching. 

I hope this maybe provided a different perspective than the one being shared on this subreddit the past 2 weeks. I wish everyone luck. 

**Note:** you may have some excuses bubbling up in your head with reasons why you aren't doing well in your courses and why you can't stick to it. Those excuses might be extremely valid, but don't let a reason you *might* not succeed become the definite reason you won't. I have pretty bad inattentiveness due to my ADHD, so study sessions are particularly hard for me for long periods of time, but I make adjustments that suit my needs (like deleting all short-form social media off my phone, creating dedicated study times, meditating to calm my mind, etc.). My point is... don't let you excuses become reasons you must do or don't do something. But also, if you do fall, don't turn those negative feelings towards yourself. Keep trying and you'll be surprised with what you can accomplish. 

Good luck. 

I put a decent amount of effort into this post, so I'd appreciate an upvote so others can see. ",submission,119

They're usually pretty well spread out to 1 a day when your taking exams within the same program. 

Though in my honest opinion, I actually preferred exams grouped somewhat close together so I can get them done asap and I would be able to travel back home earlier. A few extra days of studying wouldn't have really changed my grade that much.

Some topics are hard, some topics are easy. If everyone fails a hard class, that’s totally fair. If everyone passes an easy class, that’s also fair.

But UofT puts the thumb on the scales here - half your class fails because they didn’t open enough places in upper year classes and in the program. Even if your class was filled with geniuses, half the class fails.

In the first day of my second year one of my professors apologized - “I’m sorry that the exam you wrote last year was unfair, it was extremely difficult and contains content not entirely covered in class, but the class average was a tad high”. And that betrays the problem with UofT.

I expect a school in good faith to teach and test students in good faith. But UofT isn’t doing that - they’re evaluating students in a way that feeds the right number of them into a subsequent class.

To use a stupid analogy- imagine if an airline oversold a flight, so they intentionally made a bunch of flights with people transferring to that flight late.",comment,1
