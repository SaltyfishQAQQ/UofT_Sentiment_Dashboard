BE CAREFUL OF EMAIL JOB POSTING SCAMS SENT BY UOFT ACCOUNTS,Murky-Supermarket833,1e6ij9c,https://i.redd.it/2qlbkq97nbdd1.jpeg,1721327764.0,"I‚Äôve gotten quit a few of these recently and wanted everyone else to know about it too. 

If you ever get an email from Uoft stating that they are offering a job, do NOT accept it or give them your information. It is most likely a scam!! These job postings will try to lure you with high pay and low hours. If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it‚Äôs fake :(

Heres an example of an email that I received. 

Be careful everyone!
