There were only like 12 people there and it felt like everyone already knew each other. I couldn’t talk to anyone as they were already in groups and it would’ve felt awkward. Idk what to do 😭😭 im an introvert and idk HOW to talk to people. Anytime i try to talk to someone it ends up being an interview and i feel the continuous questions get boring 😔,submission,118

A good way to make a non interview-esque experience is to do some activity. That's the point of orientation, other than introducing you to campus and uoft. Invite people to grab some food, play some sport or other game, share your interests, find people with similar interests, go to a club, etc. Can be hard at first, and many will not stick with you, but the ones that stay are the ones that you will have the best experiences with for the next couple of years. Almost everyone is as scared as you, even in groups, so you just gotta join in.

  
ALSO PLEASE JOIN CLUBS IF YOU CAN AND ATTEND EVENTS!!! You meet so many people that like the same things you do to the same degree, no matter how much you like something. Hope you get to have a good time and meet amazing people :)",comment,1
