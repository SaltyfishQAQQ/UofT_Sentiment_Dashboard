Your brain works at different levels and if you're really chewing on something you're trying to understand, it will even show up in your dreams.  The brain's working on different levels is one reason why when (experienced) problem-solvers get stuck on something they stop and go walks, go for a bike ride, take a shower, go dancing, go do something ""mindless"".  This frees the brain; it goes from micro to macro and sometimes has breakthroughs.  Which they then rush to a piece of paper to try and, to see if it actually works or not.  (It's standard to have one's ideas not work out/be close but not quite right...)  Which then leads to more concentrated close work which then leads to stepping away.  Rinse lather repeat.  There's a lot of micro-to-macro switching as part of learning, problem-solving, and research.",comment,4

This is just a phase - it's just a few months. Learn it and never look back again. As long as you pass, no one will ask you for your grades or ask you if you know this stuff.

If someone asks me to prove my math wizardy of my younger years, I just write **âˆ« e****^(x)**Â **dx** cause... sex. 

I was a math whiz once. Now I have to think hard to do 23 + 98. And you know what, it still don't matter. I still get promoted at work cause no one gives a shit if you can do that in your head or not.",comment,-3
