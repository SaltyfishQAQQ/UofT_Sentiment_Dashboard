How is uoft’s course planning such inconvenient trash ,Craneisthename,1f9ds16,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f9ds16/how_is_uofts_course_planning_such_inconvenient/,1725510090.0,"I am in awe of how one of the top universities in the world can have such shitty course planning. I am starting to believe uoft is purposely preventing students from graduating because WHY THE HELL DO 4 2ND YEAR MATH/STATS COURSES (mat235, 244, 224, sta237) HAVE THEIR MIDTERMS AT THE EXACT SAME DATE AND TIME. This is especially embarrassing because if one person is taking one course, they’re likely taking another one as well. The chemistry department is probably one of the worst offenders though. Chm249/237 is recommended for majors and is needed for specs yet the waitlist is almost as long as the course spaces themselves. How can people WITH PRIORITY NOT EVEN GET INTO THEIR OWN COURSES, AT THAT POINT JUST MAKE MORE SECTIONS THE PRACTICALS ARE ONLY AN HOUR LONGER THAN 247. Even physical chemistry, which is apparently unpopular due to all the math, has a waitlist for chm223. It gets even worse in 3rd year, the waitlists are larger than the course sizes. This place needs to either accept less students or expand their courses and I don’t think it’s willing to do either because  all hail the mighty dollar. ",submission,91

Since the entire system is completely different than what I experienced before, I figured that someone who is more familiar with it would be able to assist me. 
The system I studied in prior to U of T was incomparable  - you pick your major, apply, you get accepted and you don’t ever need to pick any classes other than language studies. There were no waitlists, no section switching, absolutely none of it, everyone admitted was guaranteed a spot in all academic activities that would never overlap. 

Even though I did my own research, being fully aware of the fact that it’s new to me, I wanted to double check with someone whose job is to help students with picking their courses - that’s why I had my appointment and did exactly what I was told.  Naturally, why would I assume that I know better than someone who’s specifically employed at U of T to help with course selections? 
P.S. Why “academic advisor”? It is a real job.",comment,1
