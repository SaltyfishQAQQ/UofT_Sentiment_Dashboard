It’s unfortunate that textbook publishers see students as 💰💵🤑. It’s even more unfortunate that some Profs get in bed with these publishers for a cut or perhaps some other type of perk. But the same token, a huge hat off to Profs who use OpenAccess textbooks, materials and contribute to OpenAccess publications. Knowledge needs to be free, and publishers should largely succumb to the sands of time along with their outdated business models and Gutenberg presses. It’s not like their foray into electronic textbooks and “pedagogical innovation” is any good. Most of the stuff out there is so laden with unreasonable DRM, it’s borderline AODA non-compliant.

P.S. If an e-text you (or a friend) paid for fails to work properly with accessibility software, I suggest strongly and relentlessly complaining to both the publisher and the reseller (yourself or on behalf of a friend). I managed to get full refunds for half-assed textbooks this way, despite a “no refunds” policy from the publisher and the reseller. It wasn’t with UofT, mind you, but another higher ed institution in Ontario. AODA is a law, and all commercial, government, publicly-funded and non-profit entities operating in Ontario must comply with it.",comment,5

But you can find all the differences for these hypothetical textbooks here [(1)](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/world-in-the-making-9780197608289?cc=ca&lang=en) [(2)](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/world-in-the-making-9780197608364?cc=ca&lang=en) under the new to this edition section.
