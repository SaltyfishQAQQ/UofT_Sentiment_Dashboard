Some of us even went through all of high school here, and we all eventually chose here, hoping to get a good job straight out of grad and get PR within a year or two while paying that international tuition.

Well, it now seems that even if you studied some of the most competitive undergrad program in Canada, have great internships and luckily get a nice new grad job in Canada with the current Canadian market，you will still be forced to leave after working for 3 years when your PGWP expires. (Unless if you do grad school with more tuition or grind French to B2 level while working a full time job, which is super hard because most of us never touched French in our lives.)

Well, I just don't know how to deal with this situation. When I graduate and my PGWP expires, I will have basically lived half of my life here. If I go back home, I literally know no one other than relatives because I left at a very young age.

Yes most of our parents are a bit wealthier than the general population in our home countries，but still，many of our parents are working class salaryman and struggle with the tuition especially with inflation in recent years.

It's best to focus on your education and upskill yourself while looking at other countries that are more immigration-friendly. That's what I'm planning to do as well. Look into the HPI visa for UK, for example.

Edit: Also, don't be angry at Canadians or people in the comments saying it doesn't affect you, most of them aren't aware of the process for immigration, and they're just frustrated due to Canada's economy, that's why anti-immigrant sentiment is so high. It's better for your health to understand where they're coming from, and instead focus on moving somewhere else, it's best for everyone involved, even though it is quite tough for us.

But remember: the money you invested into UofT will never be a waste, it's recognized as a prestigious degree in every country around the world, and you're pretty much among some of the most talented people just for obtaining the degree. Most immigration-friendly countries are happy to bring in talented people. As immigrants, we've already left everything behind once or twice, it's just part of the struggle.",comment,50

If I go to France to get my MBA at INSEAD, or to Britain to get my DVM at the Royal Veterinary College it’s not because I want to gain permanent residency in France or Britain, but so I can obtain an excellent education with some adventure, and then return to where I came from. But Canada and its complicit provinces, universities, colleges and unregulated immigration consultants have essentially run a scam upon the South Asia (to be fair no one is better at scamming us, so touché) in order to keep tuition and education funding artificially low for Canadians. Those days of underfunding while expanding post-secondary education are rapidly coming to a close.

Every Study Permit application should have the three below terms and conditions:

1. Purpose of the Visa: This student visa is issued solely for the purpose of pursuing your studies at [Institution Name] in Canada. It is a temporary visa, and its primary function is to allow you to study and engage in academic activities. It is not a pathway to permanent residency or citizenship in Canada.

2. Temporary Nature of the Visa: Your student visa is valid only for the duration of your enrolled academic program or course of study. Upon the completion of your studies, you are required to leave Canada immediately, unless you apply for and are granted a different visa that legally allows you to remain, such as a work visa.

3. No Pathway to Permanent Residence: This student visa does not confer eligibility for permanent resident status or citizenship in Canada. You are not permitted to apply for permanent residency or citizenship while holding this visa. If you wish to apply for permanent status in Canada, you must do so separately and in person at your country of origin in accordance with the immigration laws and procedures of Canada.",comment,1

Well then all your domestic friends are gone too and you know no one here. Them moving to the US means that they too are moving to where they know no one, including not even having family. It doesn't seem to be a deterrent for them. Such is the history of migration.  

Also if you've been living in Canada allegedly from ""such a young age"", then you've been living here for a while. Why have you not already qualified for permanent residency? What is the immigration status of your family living here? What did they think was going to be your pathway forward once you became an adult?

I'm sorry if this sounds harsh but for those who come at 18 as international students, getting an education needs to be an end in and of itself. Studying here has never been a guarantee of getting PR. If your only intention for attending school here is to get PR, don't come. If you do come, then you need to be prepared to go back home (or elsewhere) at the end of your PGWP period.

An EngSci with a near perfect GPA/internships/research will have the same number of points as someone who “studied” international business at a strip mall. 

The Canadian immigration system is advertised as a meritocracy, unlike the sponsorship-based US/EU. Allowing it to go to shit (and no longer be a meritocracy) harms Canada just as much as it does OP, if not more. Well-educated, skilled (high) taxpayers will be replaced by people who won’t materially benefit the country. 

Immigrants in the US have unemployment rates significantly lower than the native-born population. It’s the opposite here, despite a greater portion of Canadian immigration being economic as opposed to humanitarian/familial, as is the case in the US. At the end of the day, their welfare/healthcare/whatever payments will be coming out of your tax dollars, leaving you with less public services or a greater tax burden (or both). 

To act as if a flawed immigration system only affects immigrants is blissfully ignorant.",comment,8

For example, one of the most common routes to PR is the Canadian Experience Class draw under Express Entry, where people with enough ""points"" are invited for PR. In the past, having good English scores, being young, having a Canadian degree and 3 years of Canadian work experience (together this can take up to 7 years) gave you just enough points (around 500) to get invited for PR. More recently, though, the required number of points has gone up to 550, making it pretty much impossible for most people to take this route. The only people that qualify now are those with bachelor's+masters/phd, really good french language scores, Canadian *and* foreign work experience, and also not too old. Besides this, there's also other changes related to student visas, like closing down the Student Direct Stream, etc.

It's just a lot more competitive now, with fewer pathways. I've heard a lot of people, both new and not-so-new to Canada getting ready to pack their bags lol. I guess it's good news if you're Canadian, not so much if you're on temporary status.",comment,10

In Canada before the recent immigration changes, the most common route is studying (4 years) and then working (3 years), which gives you enough points to get PR, it takes 7 years. Now it could be even longer. And in general it takes a really long time to get non-temporary status in most countries, so only 5 years for a country like the US is actually really good.",comment,1

For instance, even though I'm Canadian:

1. At uoft I studied marketing
2. If I try to go work in the US, I am only eligible for H1B - H1B is the most common USA work permit, about 65k are allocated each year to those with bachelors [(US gov)](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/h-1b-specialty-occupations#:~:text=The%20H%2D1B%20classification%20has%20an%20annual%20numerical%20limit%20(cap)%20of%2065%2C000%20new%20statuses/visas%20each%20fiscal%20year)
3. USA companies have to sponsor H1B (it's 100% on a company to decide if they want a citizen or hire someone through a work permit - in Canada it's more on government allocation)
4. Why would a company want to spend money for lawyers / immigration hassle / application fees / etc. to hire a marketing person like me when they have all these US citizens who studied marketing to hire?
5. Ok so now I can't get into USA at all since US companies all chose to hire low cost citizens (rightfully so though)

The main factor being marketing does not qualify for the TN visa LOL - though I do agree the TN visa is a huge advantage for Mexicans & Canadians (as long as you qualify)",comment,1

6. So for my case even if you gave me 100 years I could not get a green card from a job because I cannot even get hired by a US company!

At least international students in Canada can get PR with time (that's a great chance!) - if I were not married I would have 0 chance to get PR",comment,2

The H1B is dual-intent meaning you can have permanent resident intentions or not, while the TN visa is strictly non-immigration-intent.  So it’s still good to have the H1B! 

That’s also why my friend (who went TN-green card directly) didn’t leave the states for 5 years while it processed - because the customs agents won’t let him back into USA if they see he’s on TN (not supposed to intend to be PR) but also have a green card application in process (contradicting)",comment,1
