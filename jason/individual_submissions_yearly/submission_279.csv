I couldnâ€™t even understand my lecturer cause his mic would cut off mid sentence and heâ€™d not explain anything ever. I just started attending someone elseâ€™s lectures instead.",comment,28

And stuffs like (for example) epsilon-delta definition of a limit might look strange but are just very precise ways of stating intuitive concepts.

Once you get past these ""doing things from first principles"" humps things will look more straightforward.

Just hang in there.  And don't skip your tutorials.

Good luck with the course.",comment,18

The textbook sections are not that long though and Iâ€™m sure with some skimming you will be able to find an example or idea that is similar to what you are doing in the problem set. This was the case for most of the problem sets we had.

EDIT: Oh and also look at past problem sets. You can find them with a quick Google search and sometimes they have even the same questions",comment,2
