Document the call and details as next you can remember. This person's negativity being public means you could argue that the refutation of your school is in Jeopardy allowing this kind of behavior. Make sure you take recordings end screenshots of everything before you report anything at all. 

It would be more recourse if the person was something like an RA or staff, if it's against another student, I'm not sure if much could be done. again, depending on how egregious what they have said is, where and who they said it to/heard them there might be nothing but a slap on the wrist, if that. 

That said, universities aren't so keen on kicking out sources of money. 

I have had a previous colleague disparaging me behind my back and it was overheard by a friend. I went to the manager and was dismissed, so I went to the union for help. 

If you have a student union I would say to Lean on them. Should also have a diversity and equity office  /student help line somewhere on campus that you can refer to. 

If you do end up launching some kind of investigation, make 

 sure you tell them what is your desired outcome and why. For example, ""this person is making A& B slurs, is blatantly disrespecting victims of natural disasters as documented here and here, and for these reasons, I believe that this person does not represent the university's ethics and standards and therefore should be removed and replaced ASAP"" (or whatever is relevant to your stitch)

ALSO, if what they are saying sounds physically threatening, or you worry about safety then definitely mention it!

Edit bc I put violence instead of natural disasters.",comment,1
