It’s laudable that a light has been shone on Israel’s inability to exercise restraint. But divestment, which brought about an end to Apartheid in South Africa, has not brought about prosperity for South Africa. South Africa should be a beacon of light given the transition it moved through in the ‘90s but no one wants to do the actual, unglamorous work, of building societies up into prosperous beacons of hope.  The country in 2024 is a [shadow of its former self](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/world/article-south-africa-post-apartheid-anniversary-anc/), with a deeply corrupt government, rolling blackouts,  and withering trust in public institutions. 

What’s so sad about this conflict is that no one has any sense of what needs to happen. There’s consensus about the atrocities but no consensus about the solution, the lasting solution that leads to two prosperous nations of mutual respect. The examples of this in the world, the Weat, are loathed by the divestment movement, notwithstanding that these encampments would never, ever, be tolerated in nearly every other country on planet earth. 

Having the maturity to look inside and say, we need to ourselves do better, that is sorely missing from nearly everywhere. If you have the stamina to defy a trespass notice, please make it your life’s work to ensure that the countries that do decide to forge a path towards the light are adequately supported to ensure this ideal is upheld. Because South Africa is not doing it. Neither is Israel. Neither is Myanmar. Neither is Hong Kong. And the social media companies that increase their revenue from every response to every outrage posts are laughing all the way to the bank. Divest from that first.",comment,12

* university lets the student back without any punitive measure

All throughout this I'm wondering about the raison d'etre of each individual components

The protestors are here to support gazans (some to support the suffering people of gaza, some to support hamas in some fucked up decolonialist delusion), but I dont see what UofT has anything to do with it. There are certainly more impactful ways to garner support and to help palestinians than occupying a canadian university. The protestors are also students, who should be there to learn, but some no doubt has used this opportunity to skip classes.

University has no fucking clue what to do. UofT is there to make money, to advance knowledge by research, and to teach students. its then demanded by the protestors to divest from any investments the protestors deem heretical. Investments that it made for the sole purpose of just making money. And, considering the connected nature of global economies, you can literally pick any company and reason that it has touched and contact with the war in gaza.

As if it wasnt ridiculous itself. the university is then demanded to cut ties completely with the entire israeli state. Which completely goes against all its ethos since they now cant collaborate with israeli unis or profs, or any institution or people who may side with the israelis.

So, in my opinion, the university is doing its job perfectly. The ones who are lacking are the occupiers who arent putting their money where their mouth is, because protesting about palestine on a canadian campus does nothing for palestine. its nothing but moral grandstanding. Go walk the walk, and either go boots on the ground in the combat or humanitarian efforts there, or raise some proper money and send it to hamas or the palestinian people, but keep everyone else out of this.",comment,14

This is not a UofT issue they are protesting, this is more to do with international politics, and it would be much more appropriate to protest, for example, at the Legislative Assembly next door. I don’t disagree that there are major and important issues to protest, but I vehemently disagree with the notion that the best way to protest is to set up an encampment on a university campus, and create an environment that encroaches on the students’ comfort and safety. I cannot understand why anyone would humour people who aren’t even students at the university, setting up camp there and adding extra stress to the lives of already stressed-out students. 

Again, if this was an issue exclusively to do with the university, I would not disagree with the idea of an on-campus protest. But this is not that sort of issue, and all that’s happening is that the poor students now have to deal with random protestors, many of whom are not themselves students, on campus. While this protest should absolutely happen and the protestors have a right to protest, they do not have a right to trespass in that environment and effectively bring harm only to the students who work so hard. I cannot ever agree with on-campus encampment as a valid means to protest this issue.",comment,6

1. We find out uoft does invest in israeli related companies, which would result in even more protesting and trouble
2. We find out uoft only invests in the top indexes and not israeli companies directly (all portfolios would include some israeli market involvement)

Either way the encampments remain and uoft has now shown
1. That breaking its policy and disobeying rules can lead to enforcing demands.
2. Their entire investment portfolio, giving a significant financial draw back.

Sure, don’t invest Raytheon, but you need to draw a line somewhere and it becomes very grey very quickly.  Can U of T hold Microsoft bonds? If the military uses windows on its computers, that is profiting off of war.  What about Goodyear? Etc.

The students are asking for UofT to divest from investments in Israel, and by investments, direct investments going to weapons. Why? They are directly contributing to KILL\*NG children, babies, men and women. I don't understand why it's so hard to comprehend. The students around the globe wouldn't have held these encampments if they were listened to and if the UofT board had at least made some efforts towards cutting ties. It should be common sense in the 21st century to cut the bad guys off if they're killing babies. But here comes down the fact that these babies aren't ""white"" and mustn't deserve the same rights because of where they were born. 

I'm sure it would not have been the same and it WASN'T the same when it was happening with Ukraine. The world sided with them without a thought (as they should), but it wasn't the case for Palestinians who have been in this for the past 76 years.

Take indigenous people in Canada. The Canadian government forced them all onto reservations, took their children away and put them into residential schools. We could travel one day from Toronto and be in a community where nobody alive has ever been able to drink the water.

Or let’s try the Catholic Church. They lost a lawsuit because they raped and abused thousands of children. They were one of the primary weapons of Canadian colonialism. Yet they won’t pay the settlement because apparently they can’t afford to (though they do manage to build a lot of churches).

Or let’s try the United States. There are a lot of Muslims who will never be free again. Some are still in black sites. Others have been tortured to such an extent they cannot be freed.

Or what about Hamas? They’re rapists who are a proxy for Iran. Want to talk about Iran’s view on human rights? What have you done about Mahsa Amini?

Again, this boycott doesn’t hurt individual researchers. UofT has a program under Munk that sends students to Israel. Stopping this program is one example of what the academic boycott can resemble in practice. 
Palestinian scholars are often suppressed by the israeli universities they work for, and are very familiar with censorship and harassment. These institutions do not protect all of their representatives equally. There are ways to collaborate with, even endorse, individual academics while bypassing the formation of an institutional relationship. In fact, UofT is pretty familiar with this!

This transcendental respect for 'the law' above all else tends towards fascist ideology time and time again, because it fails to place any attention on how the law is produced. The law is not some static thing, it changes and shifts all the time. When not forced to by resistance, it tends to change to suit the interests of those with the power to change it.

You mentioned when the divestment request process was used for fossil fuels. What you didn't mention is that after that protesters agreed to start that process back in 2016, a committee of faculty members was set up to investigate the university's investments in fossil fuels, which eventually issued a list of recommendations to Meric Gertler. He proceeded to reject their recommendations and refused to divest from fossil fuels. In 2021 the university came out with their own sustainability plan, part of which was to divest from fossil fuels by 2030. This is not the protesters 'not listening to the law' or whatever, this is them learning of the mistakes of the protesters back in 2016. The fact that the divestment process has been around for a long time does not necessarily mean

For someone so concerned with laws, you don't seem at all concerned about any of the flagrant violations of international law that Israel has been committing for months on end. The fact that you think protests against a genocide should be shut down for not listening to the rules is a perfect example what I mean when I say this way of thinking tends towards fascism.

No different than the camps in Calgary and Edmonton and how they ask their protesters that were encamped to leave nearest times and they didn't so they trust past them. Just because a university is considered a public school does not mean that the land it sits on is controlled by the city. And the civil Rights movements in the states were very different. If you actually understood anything about Martin Luther King and how he helped the civil Rights movements in the States you can see he did it in a way that was way more peaceful than these protests at the UFT and other university and college campuses across canada. Not to mention he also told the people that were there supporting the civil Rights movement not to be violent. You also didn't hear calls for the death of those that they are protesting or to have all white people become slaves in the United States which is Lake asking the Jews to give up their right to a nation. If you actually understood history you would know that the so-called Palestinians were not the people that settled there they also did not descend from the Philistines. If you also did history to do with Jerusalem you would understand that the big Muslim Mosque on Temple mound is younger than the ruins of the Jewish temple. The mosque is about 15,000 years old where the temple is over 300 years old. not to mention you have a lot of Muslim countries that forced Jews out of their Nation so you might want to go look at that. And where did all those Jews from all the other Muslim nations in the middle East and Northern Africa go to oh right they went to Israel because that was the only safe place for them to go to. In Israel you do not have the Jews blocking Muslims or Christians or people that are not religious from any high-ranking jobs whether it is politics military police whatever. And maybe you should go do some research on what they teach kids in school in Gaza and the West Bank because I can tell you they teach their kids hate they teach their kids that their goal is to go out and kill as many Jews as possible.

If anything, they should be in case by case basis as calling for a basically ""total boycott""  is just dumb. But yes, certainly some institutions can be controversial than others.

There are further instances where it is illegal. A dwelling nearby is one. There are others...

Trespassing at night is a criminal offence in Canada, covered under s. 177 of the Criminal Code.

As the name suggests, trespassing at night involves standing around, walking through, or otherwise loitering on another person’s property at night. However, the offence is not necessarily as simple as that. The Criminal Code provision states that the offence is for people who ‘loiter’ or ‘prowl’ at night on the property of another person. While loitering and prowling both generally tend to have more negative connotations, loitering in this context just means standing or hanging around purposelessly. You do not necessarily have to have bad intentions in order to fit the elements of this offence.

Likewise, while most people would consider ‘night’ to be from dusk to dawn, for the purposes of this offence, night is defined as the period between 9:00pm and 6:00am the next day (see s. 2 of the Criminal Code). This applies despite the fact that in Canada, it can often be dark before 9pm or light before 6am.",comment,0

Your solution of “start with this index” is pointless if you don’t know the investments UofT has. You are still asking for protesters to check the universe of tens of thousands of companies across multiple stock markets, plus other financial instrument. It’s simply not feasible. But having transparency in their investments? Easy peasy. 


Also, the only reason why you find it hard to understand “what’s being asked” is because the nature of the investments is needed for an assessment. Unless you believe a simple term can cover companies across industries, which is just asking for the school to come up with loopholes.


And I don’t think you know how public companies operate nor how investments work. UofT does know what their investments are.",comment,0

I'm sure there are actionable elements in their demands and there is sense to their cause; Just not their actions.
