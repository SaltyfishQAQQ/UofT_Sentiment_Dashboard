And also I doubt ‚Äúthey‚Äù have any idea about this lol. 

From personal experience professors don‚Äôt even know what we know and don‚Äôt from previous courses (in engineering, where it‚Äôs more or less standardized which courses to take). Registrar doesn‚Äôt essentially assign exams to courses, they simply approve times and provide locations to the coordinator - so as long as there isn‚Äôt a direct overlap it‚Äôs considered ok. If you think about it this way there‚Äôs probably tons of exams happening per day in this coming week from 9am to 9pm all day; there‚Äôs no way around pleasing everyone, so some people gotta deal w multiple successive exams within 24hrs. But if you have more than three (within 24hr) you can defer. 

Even if there happens to be a direct overlap, students are given plenty time to defer, do an early take, or an alternative procedure with their prof.",comment,3

You can try this for next semester and maybe it will help.",comment,2
