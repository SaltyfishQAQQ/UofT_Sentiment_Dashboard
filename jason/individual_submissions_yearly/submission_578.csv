Why is just dropping the program and switching out to a different program not an option? Surely youâ€™ve taken some courses you enjoyed and have an idea of where youâ€™d like to go?

I think many people find that the issues that stop them from studying at one place will follow them to the next place. Environment changes are nice when they change but then everything becomes the same when it starts to feel like home.",comment,2

People don't talk about it (idky they dont, it almost feels illegal here lol) , but there are other students also struggling too. It's life, we mess things up sometimes.  
Don't make big decisions while youre influenced by emotions/panic. Talk to anyone, find an academic advisor, therapist, talk to a prof that you feel would be accepting and give you helpful advice (I've done this, and I really recommend because all of the cs prof here are understanding that we may not do our best sometimes bc \_\_\_\_ reason. But trust me, they are supportive and they want to help students).  
I understand the shame can feel overbearing for you to do any of this, but it is better to than regretting this decision down the line.
