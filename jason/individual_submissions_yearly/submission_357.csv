Sending good vibes tho, u got this! Don’t be hard on urself and take lots of breaks. 

Cute lil drinks help me feel motivated and there are tools for hard readings (try Unriddle ai).

Also English is quite possibly one of the hardest majors…coming from another English major!",comment,11

If you need any advice, feel free to DM anytime

Also, English (as a major) is not as easy as people think ;)",comment,14

Part of it is that you're still forming your interests, so you will have probably signed up for classes that sounded good on paper but which don't actually compel you in reality.

Part of it might also be over-inflating your expectations of yourself and being crushed by them in turn.

One thing I realized when I returned to uni is that English and some related fields are more prone to ""relative marking"" than others. That is, in English, your work is likely being graded relative to the work of your entire class. 

So often times I was surprised by the mark I would get, thinking there was no way my crappy essay written the night before could get an A, but then it would.

It wasn't until I got to a 4th year seminar and got to see first-hand the work other students were turning in that the way I had been graded began to make sense. I wasn't writing great stuff, but it was not as poorly-written or thought out as many of my peers.

I eventually switched out of English because I found a more compelling field, but by the end, I had found things that interested me enough that I was following up on them in my own free time, and that kind of self-directed learning made my actual classes a cakewalk since I could always relate what I was learning about on my own to the things we were learning in class, which of course generates paper topics very easily, and makes you less intimidated when you're assigned new works to read.

I'd say try to chill out a bit for the first year and just focus on not making tactical mistakes. Do your readings, but don't expect to ""get"" everything the first time through, and don't blame yourself for not being interested in the material. Hand in assignments on time, and don't leave midterm/exam questions unanswered. Focus more on meeting the technical standards for now rather than trying to blow anyone away.

As you take classes, notice what makes you excited to read do the work or do extra. For me my gateway was Middle English literature, which led to Old English literature, which led to a billion other things. For you it may be something else, maybe even another program altogether, as happened to me.",comment,1
