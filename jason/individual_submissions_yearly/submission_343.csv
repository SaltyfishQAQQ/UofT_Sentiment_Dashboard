Classes starts on Sep 3rd?? Did classes start this early before?,chocoloste,1ex43yx,https://i.redd.it/1judele5bvjd1.jpeg,1724180937.0,"I kind of remember in the previous years the classes all started on 10th of September or around that, like there was at least a week since the beginning of September. 

Especially this year Iâ€™m just about to end my 16 months pey coop. I thought I would at least have 1 week to rest, now youâ€™re telling me I only have 1 day???? 

UofT is the worst. Cry

From now on, classes at almost all faculties will begin the day immediately after labour day. This is new to this year.",comment,124

They also changed reading week. It means we donâ€™t end classes a week later during exam season.,comment,34

Because of Labour Day the week is already Tues to Mon. And because of Thanksgiving, any lectures on a Monday will have to make this up at the end of the year. That is, the semester will end with two Mondays.Â Â 

Â For large, multi section classes, this could potentially mean that after the last Friday of classes, any section with a Monday lecture could be a week behind everyone else. Or, in the case of the rare 3hr Monday lecture, 2 weeks behind.Â ",comment,30
