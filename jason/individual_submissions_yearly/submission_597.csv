I get that itâ€™s gonna be super difficult but itâ€™s clearly not impossible since people make it thru. 

what are the best tips to get thru with my sanity and is it rlly that bad?

For context I have a 94 average, am in a few clubs, and work like 20 hours a week. Ik the workload will be heavy but I feel like I could prob time manage like I do now. Iâ€™m also going into MSE

Iâ€™m not that close with any of them but from what they have told me itâ€™s brutal but youâ€™ll get through. I donâ€™t recall any of them ever having any mental breakdowns lol and they even managed to have some fun along the way. I know they said it was hard but they were all hard working,comment,17

If you want learn something and push yourself to the limits, and be a better you for the rest of your life, then U of T engineering is probably one of the best schools in the world.  If you want to get high marks and get into graduate or professional school, it will be challenging.  Itâ€™s not impossible, but itâ€™s very challenging.  Iâ€™ve known a lot of people that ended up getting 90s in high school and then ended up dropping out.  So be prepared.

Edit:  I strongly encourage people to take the course Learning how to Learn. I believe itâ€™s on Coursera and there is also a book out.  The course focused on spaced repetition, interleaving etc.  Make sure you eat right, get proper sleep and exercise.  Your brain is an organ and needs to be taken care of so no matter how hard you study, remember to take care of yourself. Also, if youâ€™re not enjoying the work, switch majors early on. The worst thing you can do is put yourself through 4 years of something you donâ€™t enjoy.  I enjoyed coding so much, I stopped playing video games.",comment,4

Didn't have a breakdown until mid-way through the second semester. But unlike many of my peers who exclusively studied, I tried to maintain my normal life and keep up with my non-engineering friends. I partied almost every weekend, I worked on weekends, and was a first-yr rep. Its hard because suddenly you have 8 courses that each are 3 to 5 hrs of in-person lecture or tutorial time, and then you need to study and do assignments outside of it. 

I would recommend not putting too much on your plate at first and then gradually build up to being involved in clubs and working on the side",comment,1
