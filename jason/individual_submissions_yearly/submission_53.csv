MAT137 was a huge mistake first year, I passed MAT135 the next year and then found out I needed a higher grade to post into lab medicine, and also that they take the highest mark not the most recent, so I took 125 after taking 135, a lot of angry emails were sent, but I got in to my program.

Also Uni was so pivotal in my life that I never forgot some experiences. 

Prof Sabri was also a rollercoaster ride. No one would forget him.",comment,3

Poorly organized, minimal support, and generally taught by instructors who really really don’t want to be there.  We used to joke that the purpose of the course was to push out local students who only made the cut because they can’t be as selective as they are with out of province applicants.",comment,3

I'm not sure of your familiarity with MAT135 generally, but the test is divided into two sections, ""Demonstrate"" and ""Make Connections."" Demonstrate makes up the first third, comprised of MCQs and Fill-In-The-Blanks, which usually require either logical mathematical reasoning or simple calculations. From what I've observed, the general consensus among students is that this was the ""easy"" part, and I'd agree, despite the handful of errata announced mid-test which forced me to go back and redo my answer, by the time I finished this part of the exam I had my hopes high. 

Then I turned the page to the Make Connections section, marked out of 66, made up of 5 word problems with multiple parts. The first was about the proportion of women in parliament in Ethiopia, whether a certain model for this data over time is reasonable, and finding another model for that same data using differential equations. This was the easiest question, from this point it crashed and burned. The remaining questions were worded in such a convoluted manner that I literally didn't even understand what was being asked at certain points. One question about a Harvard study on variable stars defined the variables so poorly that the first part worth 8 marks, which required the explanation of the derivative of different functions from the study, was impossible to do. We had to interpret Microsoft Copilot AI passages, what they mean and what they're missing out on. 

The worst part is that nothing could have prepared anyone for this, and I attended almost every lecture and every tutorial and completed all the homework. The homework was entirely useless. The lecturers were beyond terrible because the professor didn't make sense 90% of the time. The tutorial questions covered were either irrelevant or similar to the past years' exams, which this exam was nothing like. They provided a practice 2024 exam and the exams from 2022-2023 as practice, which several TAs whom I spoke to suggested was the best and only practice worth doing, and yet, the exam was totally different.",comment,6
