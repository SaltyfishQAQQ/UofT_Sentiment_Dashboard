The following post contains material that may be harmful or traumatizing to some audiences and contains a discussion on sexual assault.

To protect my identity and personal safety, I’m using a throwaway account.







Hey guys, I wanted to share additional information on the UTM assault at the CCT building. I was there and confronted the guy who was assaulting the girl and sent a statement to the police about the attack.  I wanted to share the TRUTH about the real events that happened that the UTMSU didn’t share with us.

I entered CCT at 2:31 PM. Upon hearing cries for help on the 1st floor of the building at 2:32 PM, I ran up the stairs to assist at 2:35 PM. The guy was pointed out to me by the victim; I spotted the guy 2-5m from the AED next to the elevator. I made contact and began to yell at the guy to get out, and I kept yelling at him to move until he ran down the stairs toward the library. The last I saw of him was that he was heading towards the library. Afterwards, I assisted the victim by telling her to breathe and gave her my name. Campus police were called, and they responded.

I gave the guy's description to the police: Brown male, 6’3-6’5, 165-170lbs(skinny), black glasses, blue shirt, black pants, grey shoes, clean shaven, black backpack.

That’s it. It was someone taking advantage of a girl.

I wanted to get on here to give the unfiltered truth because lately, I’ve been seeing the UTMSU and various other organizations spin the story to be something it’s not, creating fear and dividing the community, ""Peel police say the victim suffered minor injuries and that the incident is not believed to be motivated by hate""(CBC, 2024). In that moment, religion, politics, and race did not matter. Someone needed help, and I answered the call.

Not only did the UTMSU release a misleading statement, but they have also protected predators in the past. That's why I don’t feel comfortable sharing my identity because of their vicious harassment. I've encountered something similar in the past with a club I was a part of. A guy assaulted a girl, and the UTMSU protected and promoted him within the club.

I want to provide the objective truth about what truly happened, and I don't feel confident that the student union is doing a good job reporting the facts and protecting students.

At the end of the day, we are all students, and we all know what it is like to live a hectic student life. Our union should not make our lives harder; it should help us achieve our academic goals by making our lives easier and safer.

TLDR: The student union spun the story of the CCT incident to manipulate the student body, and they've actively failed to protect students while on campus.

Maybe /u/SyrupNo8289 is talking about something else, because their [official statement is pretty clear](https://utmsu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Response-Re_-Assault-at-CCT-Sisters-Prayer-Space.pdf) about them:


1. Updating the student population on the assault and what happened afterwards
2. Condemning the assault
3. Updating everyone on how they are working to make the affected students (i.e. Muslim students, since it is most probable that the victim was Muslim) feel safer


As to OP, you did great and you should be proud for answering to a call for help and not physically engaging with the assailant. In this case in particular, I did not get the sense that the student group was trying to protect the assailant. If it is true for other cases, I think the student population should bring forward concise evidence to UTM.",comment,3

Context matters. Their [statement](https://utmsu.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Response-Re_-Assault-at-CCT-Sisters-Prayer-Space.pdf) makes it clear that the assault happened close to the Multi-Faith Space, which is heavily used by the UTM Muslim community for prayer. Furthermore, there is a pretty good chance that, despite remaining anonymous, the victim is Muslim. The university wouldn't have just opened a ""temporary prayer space"" if this were not the case.",comment,4

We don’t need anything “more specific” such as their particular country of origin, religion; or what type of brown they are. Confirming that they are brown for this purpose is all that is needed and useful and it is absurd that articles/publications everywhere are removing colour as a way of identifying criminals like this one to fit the narrative",comment,2

The victim could have been Muslim and also could not have been. But deciding to keep that (and any aspect of religion) anonymous to the public and then go on a tangent about how this is a hate crime against muslims is misleading since now the public doesn’t know if it was or wasn’t. And if it wasn’t, the public has to presume that they are on drugs while writing this cause it makes no sense. Further, the news covers it as not hate-motivated, so again, bringing religion into this makes no sense and to the public seems like attention seeking.",comment,4

It not being a ""hate crime"" does not mean that the affected community will not feel unsafe. If you applied just _a little bit_ of critical thinking, you could deduce that an assault on a Muslim student close to the Multi-Faith Space means that the space might not be safe at certain hours. You expect Muslim students to be happy to hear that they can get assaulted, but not because of their religion 🥴


As to my last line, again, you don't seem happy that other members from our community feel safer. It is important, because you are only making a fuzz because Muslim students get to feel safer. Do you think feeling safer is preferential treatment?",comment,1

White v black v brown v blue v green is EXTREMELY helpful to the public when staying on the lookout and for being careful. It can be so easily (and frankly best) used to disqualify possibly suspects to the ordinary student in the area that may feel scared or on edge.

Idk why u keep going on about on this south East Asian stuff bc again saying that they are brown is extremely useful at differentiating potential suspects… we have a lot of whities, blackies, and brownies, and colour is often the foundational criteria to remove ideal suspects.

This assumption (since you apparently just like to assume) has not been proven by UTMSU, police, news, or op. The issue is that UTMSU is going on a tangent about something that has not been confirmed and it could easily be them trying to paint a false narrative because again, nothing has been confirmed (to the public at least).

This is equivalent to police saying ""someone was just punched in the face at a no-frills. It was random and unprovoked,"" and then you have the mayor say ""we are getting officers to monitor all play grounds in the area with tight security."" You see how this makes no sense? Why? Why playgrounds? The public would read this and be absolutely confused. Was it a child randomly punched in the face? Nobody knows and this is why there is public confusion regarding the UTMSU post. If you just stopped speaking on emotion, you would understand this.

And again, to your last line (which proves my previous sentence), I never said once I am unhappy about the muslims getting extra security or whatnot. I think there should be definitely more security around the area so that *everyone* feels safer. I am saying that based off of what UTMSU has posted, along with all the other reporting on this from police, news, and op, I also AGREE that the UTMSU seems completely unhinged and can be interpreted as misguiding the public and painting a false narrative.",comment,1
