The ULTIMATE Guide to UofT ‘Bird' Courses (From a UofT grad),Mamabean507,1d8btkv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d8btkv/the_ultimate_guide_to_uoft_bird_courses_from_a/,1717544552.0,"Hey everyone!

With course selection on the way, you may be looking for something easy to fill in your elective slots - ‘bird courses’ as they call them. The only issue is that they don’t exist. At least, not universally anyway. From personal experience and from the opinions of my fellow peers, something easy for someone else will not necessarily be easy for you.

But one thing I’ve learned throughout my four years in undergrad is that there are some general patterns that may help students decide whether a course might be more manageable than others. Some of these criteria overlap between students, while others may vary between individuals. That’s why you’ll need to consider **these four things.**

1. Personal Interest
2. Evaluation Format
3. Course Format
4. Other Opinions

BONUS: Past Exams

# 1) Personal Interest

If you’re interested in something, you’ll find yourself more motivated. When you’re more motivated to do something, you’ll find tasks easier to accomplish. As a life sciences student, I heard a bible history course was one of the easiest out there, so I decided to take it. Needless to say, it was the biggest drag of my life. I bombed the exams. I gave up at the end, CR-ed that thing and got outta there.

What I failed to consider was that the people who recommended the course had an actual interest in history. An interest in the course material fuels motivation to actually excel in a course. **Motivation can go a LONG WAY,** especially when you need to clutch up your grades. But that motivation is partly fuelled by your actual interest in the material. 

**Here’s what I recommend. Stay in the circle of your current major/minor/specialty.** A POSSIBLE reason you’re in your program is because you’re likely interested in what you’re learning. That also likely means that your brain clicks with that material better, so it might be easier for you to study it and complete assignments. As a life sciences student, I had more motivation to learn about life sciences, not history. (But if you happen to have a strong hobby or interest in something outside of your current studies, go for it!)

**TLDR; If you like it, you’ll find it easier.**

# 2) Evaluation Format 

You need to consider what will help you do as well as possible. I put evaluation format in second place, because this can influence your grades, and that matters HEAVILY. I chose many of my courses based on how they were tested, because I learned that **even if I’m not too keen on the lecture material, I can do well if the material is tested in a certain way**. The opposite also applies. Even if a course is super interesting, if the evaluation format is difficult for me, I could end up doing worse.

There are five main types of evaluation **styles.**

1. Multiple Choice (memorization based)
   1. Bell-ringer also counts here
2. Short Answer 
3. Long Answer/Essay/Report 
4. Presentation
5. Skill-based Evaluations

There are two main evaluation **settings**.

1. Take home
2. In person

There are two main evaluation **formats**.

1. Open book
2. Closed book

And finally, the evaluation **group**.

1. Team/Group 
2. Individual 

**My recommendation: Rank these from easiest to hardest based on experience and your study style. Use it to pick your courses.** Many courses have past syllabi found somewhere. Lots of things, including as the evaluation format, carry over between years. If you know someone who took a course in the past, ask for their syllabus to help you make your decisions.

Think about how you like your evaluations. Do you like memorization? Application-based? Presenting your knowledge? *As well, what takes the least amount of time for you to prepare for?* The more time you have, the more comfortable your university experience will be. For example, I liked memorization-based courses with a multiple-choice evaluation style, because cue cards were so fast and easy to make, and that made studying much easier. It takes me about 1 hour a day to study the cards, and that allows me to invest more time in my required courses which may have evaluations styles I struggle more with.

*Example Ranking:*

STYLE:	**M/C** > Presentation > Short Answer >>> Essay > Skill-based

SETTING: **Take home** > In person

FORMAT:	**Open book** > Closed book

GROUP:	**Individual work** > Team-based work

EVALUATION: **STYLE** >>> FORMAT > SETTING > GROUP (this means that I value Style much more over the other categories)

**I therefore choose my ‘bird course’ based on how closely they apply to my ranking.** You can make a list of courses (shown below) and decide what would suit you best from that list.

**TLDR; If you prefer a certain evaluation style (e.g. M/C, SA, Essay), you’ll find it easier to do better in the course. Use this to choose your courses.**

# 3) Course Format

Each of us learn in different ways. For example, I have a friend who prefers to go to all lectures in person rather than listening to recordings. Seeing the professor live allows them to absorb the material better. I personally like asynchronous classes. I like to arrange my schedule the way I want and watch lectures at 2x speed in the comfort of my own home. I learn better that way.

**Use an understanding of how you learn best to choose courses that suit your learning style.** Here are some things to consider.

1. Do I like learning at my own pace, or at the pace of a live lecturer? 

(**Synchronous vs. Asynchronous** Lectures)

1. Do I like learning from one professor or from multiple guest professors? 

(**Consistent vs. Inconsistent** Teaching styles)

1. Do I like hands on courses or hands off courses? 

(**Lab/Application-based vs. Lecture-based** Courses) 

1. Do I like to teach others or to be taught?

(**Seminar vs. Didactic** Lectures)

1. Do I like one long lecture a week or multiple spread throughout the week?

(**Single Block vs. Multiple Blocks**)

You can rank these (as seen previously) and choose your courses this way. 

**TLDR; The better a course aligns with your preferred learning style, the easier it will be. Feel free to rank course styles to choose your 'bird' course.**

# 4) Other Opinions

I leave opinions to last, because again, they’re quite subjective. However, there is some value in considering them, especially since your peers can give you the best idea of what a course or professor is like. Reddit itself is quite a valuable resource since many courses have been discussed here. If hundreds of people are saying a professor teaches terribly, it may be worth considering that there is truth behind that statement. Then again, I’ve taken some courses that have been severely discouraged by peers and have done great in them. That’s why I’d rely on understanding yourself first (my first 3 points). Once you’ve done that, considering other opinions is up to you.

**TLDR; it may be useful to listen to others, but be careful. It’s very subjective - other’s experiences may not accurately describe how you will experience a course. Go off your own experiences first (see first 3 points!)**

# BONUS: PAST EXAMS

This is here for the rare case that you might have found a course you absolutely hate, but there are a wealth of past exams available for students to use. This will quite literally turn a course around, **especially if the course re-uses past exam questions** (cough cough PSL300/301 and CHM136 cough). If you manage to get your hands on those treasures, the course will be smooth sailing for you, especially if you practice those exams over and over.

Here’s how to check:

1. Old Exam Repository. Search up your course code and see what’s there.
2. The illegal stuff. It’s out there. Someone has a google drive of something. Just ask around.
3. ASSU or Student Unions selling them.

Finally (if you made it this far), I also wanted to add that **these tips may not apply universally**. For example, I hate essay-based courses, but I had to take one as a required course and found that it was really fairly evaluated with a great professor. I hate courses with guest lecturers each week, but I took one and did extremely well because the marking was super fair. **This post is only meant to help students create a basic framework for choosing courses.** 

That’s all from me! Thanks for reading!",submission,167

Commenting to add that Evaluation frequency & Weights of the assessments may also matter to some folks. E.g. I struggled in courses with lots of small assignments worth like 1-3% each, and preferred classes with 2-4 big assessments heavier in weight (e.g. 30-30-40 split between three essays).",comment,5

This is also worth considering. The time to complete assignments may also matter to people as well (e.g. a 60 min/60 q multiple choice is more difficult than a 120 min/60 q multiple choice). It really depends on how much information a student is able to get their hands on about a course!,comment,1
