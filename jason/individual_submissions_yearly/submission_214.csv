I've been watching what's been going on at McGill with police presence in riot gear, vandalism, and videos of protesters yelling out chants and protests inside the actual graduation ceremonies interrupting graduating students' names being called out. Seeing all that, I'm pretty grateful that the encampment at uoft has been relatively peaceful in comparison and no disruptions have happened inside the actual ceremonies - which is just plain disrespectful to the students graduating and not the administration, and pretty disheartening given that our cohort's university experience consisted of 2 years of online learning/cancelled exams/shitty planning by the university. I hope uoft continues letting students who choose to silently cross the stage with flags/keffiyeh etc. continue doing so - it's admirable and it probably helps keep the actual ceremony free of vocal protesters coming inside and intentionally trying to disrupt the ceremony. I know I shouldn't make graduation out to be a big deal but these last 4 years have been pretty challenging and being able to finally hear my name called out and walk across that stage is something I've been really looking forward to and, at certain points, visualizing that has been the only motivation to not drop out and see this degree through. I'm a graduating student and my convocation is on the very last day (a day after the injunction hearings end) so I'm definitely a bit anxious about what might happen on that day, especially because my brother who moved to eastern Asia has spent a shitload of money on flights just to see me graduate.",submission,129

Personally, I'm not wild about any protest setting up a society, but on the grounds of a university is probably the best place to do it if you are going to do it. I just hope people can have their day without too much outside noise and everyone keeps it cool and respectful.

To suggest a *different* protest should not exists because what you currently deem worthy isn’t as visible is foolish and suggestive that perhaps you could lead the drive towards visibility of your own cause.
