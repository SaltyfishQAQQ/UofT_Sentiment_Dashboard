I have to ask if you truly believe you can handle the rigour of law school and the following career if your first couple years have been this bad.

If you can get a 3.44 AND do really well on the LSAT AND probably apply access instead of general AND have a good reason for applying access/can explain your GPA, maybe you can find a school to let you in?

But again, if that's your GPA after almost 2 full years, what's changed so much that's made the idea of 4.0's from here on out a realistic possibility?

Someone with a 3.mid can definitely make it into law school based on a number of factors. Whether you can achieve that is the bigger question for me. 

These questions often lead to more positive responses from people so sorry if I seem negative. I just trying to give you a realistic answer to your question",comment,80

Probably. I did not get into a single law school with a 3.4 GPA and an average LSAT score as well as plenty extracurriculars.

BUT the good news is that you don't have to go to law school. I got a great job in my field right after graduation, worked for the past 4 years, and got into UofT's MPP program with a scholarship.

As others have also said, you might be able to get in. But if you do, you may not be able to *stay* in, which is the actual hard part. You will have potentially wasted time and money. And to what end? To desperately stay in a program, scraping by, not actually enjoying it, not securing the best articling or research positions. 

No one says you HAVE to go to law school. If you want to continue your education because you like school, maybe apply to a college or university program in something that echoes your university degree and furthers your job prospects, which is the whole point of schooling. Or get some work experience and go back to grad school later.

Having an LSAT that is 95th percentile plus can easily balance out a poor gpa (poor as in 3.low-mid) and especially in American law schools, where the focus is on LSAT (unfair but reality) it gives you a chance to be a ""splitter"" student. Some schools like WUSTL allow you to apply with a redacted gpa so they only see your lsat. And they give big scholarship money to high scores. If staying in Canada, be sure to look into access categories and especially apply to holistic schools like Osgoode that look at your entire application. At the end of the day, some may say that attending law school is not realistic for you because you haven't proven yourself in undergrad. That is absolutely possible, but doesn't apply to everyone, especially with extenuating circumstances impacting your ability to do well (particularly if you chose a tough undergrad background, are struggling with a lack of accommodations, etc.). Ideally, you make your own decisions when it comes to your future, so law school will also be one of those decisions.

Think about whether itâ€™s for you though, I say this because thereâ€™s this idea amongst some that get into law school and become a lawyer, youâ€™ll automatically be rich and successful - that is not the case at all. I know lawyers that make under 40k and lawyers that make over 200k. The latter isnâ€™t very common.

A few law students in law school will figure this out and then some will have doubts or even leave (yes, you read that right, as hard as it is to get in - arguably the hardest part) some people leave in 1L, 2L. If this is your goal though, I respect it and keep working at it.

Youâ€™re going to have to probably apply multiple cycles due to competitiveness (if Canadian law schools are your goal) and do well on the LSAT

I kinda know where you're coming from because I tore several knee ligaments and needed to relearn how to walk after a ski accident and my god my second year is horrible, though not as bad as yours (3.8 first year to 2.8 for 2nd) and it definitely felt helpless. 

However, there was a few strategic things I could pull off to buffer it. Med school is the goal, and I'm doing a double degree program --> therefore I could load on more courses so that they only consider the top 5 courses per year for OMSAS application (everyone does except for u of t, us psychopaths). 

I have a high capacity for academics (projects, etc) even if I don't have the best luck during tests so I buffered the psych stuff with more assignment-oriented english courses that would boost the gpa. That way even if one was a flunk (70 or less) the rest would make up for that. I also had to rework how I study (yay neurodivergence) but I've found that bribery is hella effective. 

It was a lot of work but If I keep up my streak I'll be graduating with a 3.7 to 3.8 to according to OMSAS and U of T's Temerty Faculty of Medicine gpa calculator (which, again, mind you only looks at the usual courseload + picks your top ones if you did overload) 

If you're struggling with just 3 courses then you really need to rework how you study. I'm sure you can use the Second Attempt at Credit (SAC) option for you two lowest scores, which'll boost your GPA somewhat too. You'd be surprised at how much a 60 can drag things down. 

The other piece of advice is to look at what law school requires specifically, identify which of those are strengths for you, and exploit the hell out of them. Graduating with a good grade is hard work, but I find that more than anything it's about strategic thinking and how you set yourself up for success. Hard work in a ineffective way still results in a bad gpa T-T 

So yeah it's definitely possible but you're gonna need to flood than engine with nitirous or something, yknow? like give it double what you've been giving it right now",comment,1

A lot of schools actually do weighted gpas (I.e. best or last two years, best 20 credits, etc - queens, uwo, tmu) so you're definitely not out of the running *if* you can change from this point and do well on the lsat (aim for 90+ percentile, and if you somehow can get like 170+, it'll do wonders to your app)",comment,1

Also, sure they can apply as a mature student but ""Just finish your degree that you're two years away from, wait an additional 5 years so you'll qualify as a mature student, and then apply for this other program which will take 3 years"" does not seem like reasonable advice to a young student who is clearly struggling. 

And sure you can say ""Just get a near perfect score on the LSAT!"" but again, if this person hasn't shown the study habits and capacity to get even a B average in early years of undergraduate, that also seems like a magic fairy dust solution that is not realistic.",comment,22

That is absolutely not the main determinant and cannot, for instance, overcome a poor undergrad gpa. Schools are very specific with their requirements and clearly illustrate what they look for). In your case, all hope is not lost at all, especially in the Canadian context of schools like western/queens who only look at best 2 years (often an emphasis on the last two). The lsat is also changing this year starting June so you'll be able to focus your preparation better with one reduced section, and I'm certain that a score north or 167+ can give you some admissions in canada and the states.

So the advice for you is improve your GPA coming forward. Aim for the highest grade. 

You can take 1 more year (or even 2) if you need it. 

If you think your GPA is still too low, you can apply to some US law schools without disclosing your GPA. A killer LSAT will mostly guarantee admission.
