The norm in the U.S. for a PhD is to apply without doing a master's first. In Canada, an MSc is usually similar to PhD in terms of activities and funding by the institution. In the U.S. it is usually a cash cow to take large amounts of money from international students and thereby subsidize the other activities of the university.

I would not consider paying for a master's in the U.S. somewhere with the idea of getting into a more competitive PhD program afterward. It is a waste of your time and money.

I would discourage you from doing a funded master's in Canada with the idea of going to a U.S. PhD program afterward, but at least that will only be a waste of your time and not also your money.",comment,23

Grades are important only because they are frequently used as a cutoff. Past that research potential is what matters keeping in mind that different professors will value different things to differing degrees.

The following are things that are frequently looked at in no particular order:

* Grades (especially in courses relevant to the planned research)
* Courses taken
* Time to complete the degree
* Thesis
* Research experience
* Statement of purpose/research statement
* Writing skills
* References
* From an interview (if any):

-- Lab fit

-- Communication skills

-- Expectations/goals

Probably more however that's what comes to mind immediately.

If you plan to do a PhD in the USA, then do not do a master's in Canada. Direct entry PhD is the norm in the USA.",comment,17

Doing a Masters can help focus your interests, and give you a trial run on what grad school is like (aka totally different from undergrad).  

Whether you’ll get in?  Hard to know.  I had a very high GPA, excellent letters, and a strong research statement.  I was also going into a niche area, where the connection between the program I chose and one of my U of T profs was important.

I don't mean to sound dick-ish, and I did do my undergrad at U of T as well, and no offence but U of T means absolutely nothing. It is far too big of a school to be considered elite. They will absolutely NOT be taking into account how ""hard"" U of T is. Every single one of my friends who ended up getting into a top 5 PhD program in their field not only a) did a Master's at an ""elite"" institution, but b) also strengthened their application with 1-2 years of extra work (e.g. Brookings, Chatham House, etc), language training, or pre-doctoral research. 

Elite schools, by definition are going to be competitive. It is the norm to have a master's to be a competitive applicant for those schools. Look at the current PhD candidates at those schools for your program. Their CVs will be on there. I guarantee you that if they didn't already do their undergrad at an Ivy/Stanford/MIT/Oxbridge, the vast majority of them did their master's at one of those schools/equivalent schools. 

Of course, if you're just looking to get into a PhD program, it's not necessary, but for the top schools, that is the norm. Academia is a small, incestuous world, and you want to be a known quantity to the AdCom. The best way of ensuring that you are a known quantity is to have already gone to one of those schools, so that the school and/or your Master's supervisor can artificially silo you into a more favorable position for admissions. Even my friends who went to good but not ""elite"" schools in the US, like Duke/UVA/Emory/Vanderbilt were having a hard time breaking into the top, top tier without doing a master's at one of those schools. 

You need to prove that you are committed to the research life, and they do not want people to Master out. The best way to demonstrate that is to have already done a master's, and to have done extra prep work to show that this is absolutely your first choice and you have committed lots of time and energy into it. You want to do a PhD in 20th century Chinese wartime history? Great! Spend an extra year or two to make sure you are not only fluent, but are literate in both simplified and traditional Chinese, and for good measure, probably Japanese as well. You want to do a PhD in economics but don't have any publications? Shore that up by doing 1-2 years of predoctoral work at an Ivy. 

I don't want to get too specific with details because the academia world is small and I don't want to dox myself or my friends, but you can DM me for more specific details if you like. I'm most familiar with the AdCom process/what they're looking for in PoliSci, History, and Economics at the Ivies/Stanford/Oxbridge if that matches your field.",comment,3

I would suggest applying to a variety of programs in the U.S. and Canada and then deciding based on where you get into. Master's programs in Canada are a smart option if they're applicable to you. But only in lieu of doing direct-entry PhD in that very same program, with an option to reclassifying later if that's what works best for you. Don't do it as a stepping stone to a PhD elsewhere. You will likely have to spend so much time redoing the master's level work, even at a different Canadian university.",comment,2

1. Compared to Canadian Economy (where the gist of its economy is confined in GTA, Montreal area), their economy is great and I see quite a lot of opportunities with various options not only in my interest field of academia but also in terms of the regions.

2. As UofT don't prefer UofT undergraduates when it comes to the grad school admission, because of the avoidance of academic incest thing, I find it way better to focus on US top schools. Even if I cannot become a professor, I can settle down in the US after completing PhD, like Canadians do (I'm not Canadian, nor American), there are a lot of competitive companies/enterprises in the US. Even if I end up doing my PhD in California where its living is getting worse, I can return to Canada with Top school degree and can strengthen my resume which can weed out competitiors when it comes to job opportunities.

3. As their economy is the best in the world, and when I look over the faculty information as well as their funding towards their labs, I see bright future towards my research interest, whereas in Canada there's only one option (which is UofT)

This is untrue, or at least not universally true (it may depend on the department). As an example take a look at the universities these admitted students attended

[https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/graduate/welcome/are-you-thinking-about-coming-toronto/](https://www.physics.utoronto.ca/graduate/welcome/are-you-thinking-about-coming-toronto/)

Out of 44 admits, 11 were from UofT, the greatest number from any one school. The stricture about not attending the same university for graduate school as undergrad is mostly a thing of the past.
