University is full of days with tons of works and stuff it gets overwhelming if you add a daily hefty commute. If you can afford to move here please do. I live in Scarborough and when doing courses downtown the commute at times since I don’t drive wears me down . 

There will be days where youd just like to rest or maybe have a 9 am exam or a Saturday midterm, living close to campus is gonna be something you will thank yourself for in hindsight",comment,15
