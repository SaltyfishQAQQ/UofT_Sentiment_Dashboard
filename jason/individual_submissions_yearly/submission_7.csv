I could go on and on.  

There are so many issues causing suffering right around the students yet they choose to ignore or are too rich to relate to.  These students need to get off their high horses, take a look around and open their eyes.  

The real answer here is that we have other states sponsoring unrest in our country, taking advantage of our freedom to protest and targeting our naive youth. 

I beg you guys, give your heads a shake and wake up!  Obviously the war is bad and we want it to end, but your energy is being wasted when other issues that could actually impact lives fall to the wayside.  You are also being USED!

Students *have* protested and organized events about the issues you listed — housing affordability, tuition hikes, homelessness, you name it. There have been protests for rent control, and tuition freezes, and they’ve pushed for better immigration policies. Maybe you missed all of those? Also, it’s not ‘naive’ to stand up for something that directly affects friends, families, and communities, whether here or abroad. Many students have family in the region, and it’s their right to protest Canada’s role and the handling of these situations. So no, we’re not being ‘used’; we’re standing up for what’s right, and I’d argue it’s your privilege speaking if you think it doesn’t impact people here. 

You brought up Ukraine like it’s the prime issue students should be protesting, but let’s not ignore the fact that Canada has sent BILLIONS of dollars to support Ukraine — way more than it ever has for Palestine; an ILLEGAL occupation and genocide that’s been ongoing for decades, not a “war”, as you claim. This aid, alongside rising global commodity prices, has contributed to inflation and made things more expensive here, from food to gas. So if you’re going to talk about how protests should focus on local issues, maybe recognize that Canada’s involvement in the Ukraine conflict is also impacting the economy. The hypocrisy is real. The fact that Palestine doesn’t get even close to the same coverage or government backing makes it *more* of a reason to protest. You thinking it’s just a “war” and downplaying how much Canada has been dickriding Israel in their bombing campaign against the Palestinians just proves how little you’re informed. ​Maybe YOU need to “get off your high horse” and stop pretending like the suffering of people over there doesn’t matter just because it’s not front-page news here.

It’s wild how you put all this energy into keyboard smashing on a student sub when you could easily protest for all these causes yourself. Students are out there exercising their freedom to protest—maybe instead of complaining, you should shut up and do the same? If you care so much, get off Reddit and start organizing.

Did you see the footage of Hamas throwing a fucking grenade inside of a packed bomb shelter? Did you see the people set ablaze in their cars? The elderly, children shot, decapitated? Probably not or you probably think it’s all propaganda. You can’t be against it on one side if you’re condoning it on the other. I don’t see you calling out Hamas here.

Actually if my knowledge of history serves me right (and believe me it fucking does,) Palestinian Arabs have been doing that kinda shit since 1517. But yknow I’m still confused how people from a diaspora returning home are considered genocidal colonizers, but the people from a peninsula that doesn’t include Israel or Palestine, that massacred and colonized their way in aren’t. 

I’m pissed my tax dollars are helping these privileged fucking children march every fucking week to call for the death of my people. And don’t fucking say it’s just Zionists, you guys use antisemitic stereotypes, you people say Hitler had the right idea, you guys use the token group Jews for Palestine which to my knowledge, tokenism is racism right? Apparently Jews don’t get that same privilege even though we’re considered an ethnic group. 

You’re more than likely a privilege child that will thankfully never have to experience what we as Jews are going through collectively, to never have to prove why your existence matters to people, to be blamed for a country’s government’s actions when you never even stepped foot inside it. To not be believed when your people were viciously attacked and raped, or worse blamed for it. To not have consistent fucking lies spread about you. To be constantly painted as this monstrous being when not just myself, most Zionists just want peace. Israeli Jews were living alongside Palestinians when they came into Israel for work, school, medical reasons whatever. It’s people like you and these protestors that cause division. You don’t care about peace, you care about looking good. That’s it. Virtue signallers are the fucking scum of the earth.",comment,5

It’s normal to deflect or reject this idea initially, as it’s a common human instinct. Even if the footage you mention is real, remember that the government of the Occupation put its own citizens in harm’s way, knowing from Egyptian intelligence that an attack was imminent. This doesn’t absolve the resistance group of blame—violence is violence—but we should also examine who incites and enables it for their own benefit.

You asked why only one side is being blamed by the protesters. The devastation caused by the IDF has been declared war crimes against humanity by every major world organization, including the UN, and acknowledged by countries globally. That’s why people don’t compare—one side is clearly much more violent than the other. Look at regular people’s social media from both sides of the wall and make your own decisions. Also, look at main stream news outlets they’re all still pro-Isreal, seems like you just don’t want people to be pro-Palestine although until this day people are penalised for being publicly pro-Palestine whereas it’s acceptable to be pro-Isreal. Tides are changing with the younger generation, so I understand why it’s stressing you out.

Your second paragraph is confusing. I won’t sugarcoat it: this genocide affects Jewish people globally. Anyone who disagrees is either in denial or doesn’t understand. That said, it’s not the students’ fault. They are asking for the university to divest, not to slander an entire religion, which is why you’ll find Orthodox Jews in pro-Palestine circles. You might argue that this still causes harm, but consider this: why should the emotional harm of one population be prioritized over the physical harm of another? Two wrongs don’t make a right, and both sides are being harmed—albeit disproportionately. It’s crucial to look at the root cause of the problem. You mentioned people from the diaspora returning home. Palestine being given to WWII survivors was a random act by European powers (Balfour Declaration) because the US and Europe didn’t want Jewish refugees. According to the Torah, Talmud, Jewish highly rated scholars and the bible, a Jewish state is not to be claimed until the arrival of the Messiah. Therefore, there is no singular ‘home’—the whole world is their home there is no returning. Palestinians and Judaism are being used as pawns to benefit the wealthy and ironically, to hasten the second coming, which many believe means that non-Christians, including Jews, will burn in hell. One interesting thing you can do is try and dig up is Jewish refugees from Poland and Hungary testimonies of how some were hosted by Palestinians or even how some “settled”. 

Most people whose belief systems have been shaped by lifelong propaganda often find it difficult to see beyond its smoky barriers so I don’t expect to see my point of view but I hope you try.

And one more thing, we live on land that was promised to the ‘right type of European Christians’ by God, and both sides of this island have committed—and continue to commit—horrific acts of violence against the natives in the name of Jesus. After hundreds of years, we have come around and acknowledged that it’s their land because we know it was never really promised to us by God.

 P.S. I don’t believe in humanities credulous faith in inherented religion and belief.",comment,2

Either way, Isreal has shifted the strategy and hundreds of its soldiers have died just to appease a world that demands jewish blood. That's why the death tolls in Gaza haven't really claimed much over the last few months. Not saying that war isn't horrible and it is definitely extremely tragic for all involved. Hamas has also received billions of dollars in aid, Hanaiyeh himself was worth 4 billion at the time of his death. The difference is Israel uses most the military aid as protection for its civilians, without that the death toll in Israel would've been even higher the Gaza.

Maybe you read propaganda too. Plenty of smart historians who know each sides narratives support Zionism, and there are also those who disagree. But not everyone who disagrees with you is stupid and if you think that's the case I suggest you yourself should read more instead of having an idiotic superiority complex.

Israel withdrew from Gaza, and kicked out all the Jews, in 2005 in an attempt for peace. They also gave the Sinai back to Egypt. Israel is only attacking Gaza because Hamas slaughtered Jewish and Arab Israelis along with foreigners too. What Hamas does is hide children in their military bases so when Israel bombs their military bases Hamas can take photos of dead children. Hamas started this war and intentionally puts children in harms way to make Israel look bad.

At the end of this day this war is between a terror organization who murders innocents intentionally and a democratic state who kills civilians as collateral damage when they engage in a war they do not want.

Each point I've made is factually correct but if you're so sure this is only Israel's fault explain why and which thing I said was false.",comment,5

Literally all available evidence. Israel put forth disinformation within that first couple days but after a couple weeks or so it had been proven. 

This is what happens with pretty much every claim Israel makes. It turns out to be proven to be a lie. Not only a lie but most of the time the lie is based on atrocities Israel is actually guilty of. The beheaded babies for example. Hamas didn’t behead any babies. They did murder one which is unspeakably horrific and indefensible. But Israel has beheaded babies. They’ve beheaded well over 30. And these aren’t just made up lies like the imaginary beheaded Israeli babies. These are actua human babies that have actually been beheaded. Probably hundred of them. Israelis have murdered well over 2100 babies as of August 15. I repeat Israel has killed over TWO THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED TIMES AS MANY BABIES AS HAMAS DID. 

Also the use of rape as a weapon of war and accusations of mass rape. There is no legitimate evidence any rapes occurred. They most likely did though but there absolutely was no mass rape or systematic rape. If it did happen, it was not widespread. In cases of actual mass rape, there is a plentiful of evidence and victims. Not a single Israeli has claimed to have been raped. One hostage says she was sexually assaulted and I believe her. That is evil and inexcusable. But that just puts into perspective how evil Israel is. Considering Israel is actually using rape as a weapon of war. Countless Palestinian hostages who were victimized have come forward. Not only with allegations but with physical evidence that *rape* occurred. Including children. 

Israelis are *systematically* using rape as a weapon of war. They are committing gang rapes. They are raping hostages with hot metal rods and electric probes and trained dogs. They are gang raping hostages. They are raping hostages as a torture method. They are even raping hostages to death. Including children. Raping kids to death. Israelis are raping kids to death.

Again these are not empty allegations and outright blatant lies from some perverse and sexually deranged old man working for Zaka. Like the Israeli “allegations” (excluding the single woman who was sexually assaulted). There is actual evidence. There are actual victims making allegations not just creepy old Zaka men revealing their darkest and sickest sadistic sexual fantasies, seeing who can make up a more creatively evil lie. These are actual victims and there is actual evidence. Not just evidence but proof. 

Israeli terrorists were filmed gang raping a hostage. One of the perpetrators was turned into a celebrity in Israel after Israelis carried out their pro-rape riots. Israelis rioted for the right to rape. And then they made a gang rapist war criminal into a hero and celebrity. That is Israeli society. That’s where we are at. Israeli is at this point just a rapist entity. And a child mass murdering entity.",comment,0

Do you think Hamas was born in a vacuum?

Not really, but it seems like you do think that since you were afraid of making the acknowledgment yourself.

If by “Gaza” you mean Hamas, the ultra simplified answer is that they found themselves between a rock and a hard place  both politically and existentially, and it was the best bad move they had. Hamas has been moving slowly toward more diplomatic relations with the Israeli government since releasing their newer, softer charter six years ago, while right wing, Anti Palestinian sentiment within Israel grew (the rock). Unfortunately, playing nice(er) also led directly to them losing some of their Islamic Revolutionary bona fides with more hardline Palestinians, which is important enough that it started to call their legitimacy as representatives of Gazans writ large into question (the hard place). Add to this that Hamas’ biggest ally, Iran, found itself in a very difficult position politically thanks to their (very unpopular) support of Syria and the normalization of relations between Israel and the Saudis. 

The October 7th attacks did a few things to ease some of this pressure on Hamas:

-Hamas regained some popular support with Gazans. Many Gazans don’t like Hamas, but when the Israeli counterattack does not often draw a firm distinction between the two groups, the issue becomes existential for them as individuals. Do you support the invading military trying to kill you and your loved ones, or the people fighting them? Easy answer for most people, whether or not they share the defenders’ politics. 

-This also strengthens Hamas’ claim to the leadership of the Palestinian nationalist movement, and not just in Gaza. Israel’s brutal, indiscriminate response has undermined the moral position of the softer-line Palestinian Authority in the West Bank, which now lets Hamas set the agenda. 

-Israel’s response has become the most important ongoing event in the region, distracting Iran’s neighbours from their support of Syria. It also killed any talk of Israel-Saudi normalization. All of this is good news for Hamas’s biggest financial supporter. 

So to answer the question, the end goal is basically what has already happened and is happening—assuming Israel is unsuccessful in eliminating Hamas outright. They would have known this was a risk, of course, but given the position they (and Gazans as a whole) were in,it seems as though it was one they felt they had to take.",comment,1

It matters more only because it belongs to contemporary history. Student dominated revolution was very quickly replaced by a large scale working class de facto civil war. Mao himself admitted that it was a civil war.,comment,3

But, this is beside the point because I was not talking about the USSR but instead the socialists, communists and other revolutionaries that were within the Weimar Republic before the Nazi’s and fought against Nazi rise to power.

First, a nation’s government is not always supported by or representative of its populace—the average Jewish citizen is likely not well represented by the political state of Israel. Being against a government (a political entity) is NOT the same as being against a general populace/racial/ethnic group. 

Second, if convicting a country of war crimes (which has a high bar for conviction) makes their violence worse and escalates the situation, is that not a red flag that they are acting maliciously/unethically and should not be supported? 

And third, have you seen the reports of Palestinian journalists and media reporters being intentionally executed? It’s not exactly a secret that there has been repression of information for the ongoing situation by the Israeli government. Does it not, then, logically follow that gathering evidence of war crimes being committed in an area where there is information suppression might…be difficult?? And require more time?? Not because the case is weak, but because people recording evidence in photos and videos are being targeted and killed? 

Stop licking the boot and engage your brain. Consider that *anyone* can commit atrocious acts if they convince themselves they’re in the right. It isn’t antisemitic to acknowledge that or to consider the overwhelming evidence of extreme violence.",comment,1

Israel cannot afford and does not carpet bomb. The devastation is as a result of terrorists embedded within the civilian population. Left alive, they promise to repeat Oct 7. What would you do?

Canada might not have troops on the ground, but Trudeau has consistently shown support for Israel on the international stage, he’s openly reaffirmed Canada’s backing of Israel. Canada’s position, including its passive support of Israel’s actions in Palestine, contributes to the issue. By participating in arms sales and expressing solidarity with Israel, Trudeau’s government enables the continuation of violence there. Canada has sent millions in military aid to Israel over the years, much of which is used in conflicts that devastate Palestinian lives. Now, we’re finally seeing a little bit of change since Canada is finally blocking military shipments to Israel, but their involvement still remains significant and they’re still complicit. So no, we’re not wasting time — we’re holding the government accountable for supporting a genocide. 

With the way you talked about Ukraine as if it was a more worthy cause than any other, one would think you’d have the same stance on Palestine, but of course y’all always turn a blind eye when it comes to POC, especially in Africa and the Middle East.

Second, the question is not about war crimes, but about genocide. You are delusional if you think it won’t be used as a rallying cry to deepen the regional war. What do you honestly think would happen?

Third, shouldn’t one make accusations if they have evidence first and not the other way around? What is with the ass-backwards logic?

It’s laughable that “extreme violence” in the middle east makes you focused on Israel-Palestine. Have you hyperfocused looked at the map at all? You might start to get concerned about war zones that have taken 10x the lives than Israel and Palestine ins 1/10th of the time. Not a thought for Yemen’s 80k dead children?

It's just that the current war and all the damage it has brought is primarily due to the terror organization Hamas, for starting the war and intentionally putting civilians in harm's way. Without their evil tens of thousands more people would be alive, Gaza would be peaceful, and if Gaza was run competently Egypt and Israel would lift their blockade allowing it to function like most other world regions.

The situation in the West Bank isn't good I agree the IDF needs to do a much better job protecting its inhabitants.

You don't need to be some agent/paid shill to support Israel. I get you're anti-semitic but your views don't line with reality. The reality is if you want a fair solution that ends the conflict and brings peace to Palestine then Israel needs to do what it needs to do, aka getting rid of Hamas. If Israeli's give up on their homeland because some religious zealots and braindead college students can't handle the fact the victim is defending themselves, then will Palestine be free of terrorism? Of course not. They'll only be used to further terrorist goals because their population has been indoctrinated by a terrorist organization for decades, and the only way that stops is now. If you care about Palestinians, you'd look into the conflict beyond your narrow-minded approach. It's ironic, I've watched way more media and interviews from Hamas than Israel and I've just come to hate them.

1. Israeli military protects the Christian holy sites. Church of the nativity in Bethlehem for hundreds of millions of tourists.

2. The holocaust wiped out like half the jewish people on the planet due to german atheists genocidong them. And Europeans and Americans share the guilt for watching that happen.

The reason secular European and American politicians support Israel are 3 reasons. Most of them don't know these 2 reasons.

1. Protect the Suez Canal and international shipping.

2. Control migration from Africa and Asia into Europe. (Israel is a geographic migration chokepoint)

3. Break up the Ottoman empire and stop it from reforming.

That’s ridiculously ignorant. Canada’s support, whether through military exports or political backing, absolutely strengthens Israel’s position on the world stage. Every country that enables Israel, whether it’s through weapons, diplomatic cover, or silence, plays a role in the continued violence. To say that removing all support would have no impact shows your lack of understanding of how international relations work. And *strategically*? Protests and international pressure have worked before — look at how global activism contributed to ending apartheid in South Africa. Pretending Canada’s role is meaningless is straight-up naive.

It’s funny how we’re taught so much about the Holocaust and other atrocities in school—conflicts Canada had no direct involvement in, by your logic. But when similar horrors happen to POC, suddenly we should all stay silent, despite Canada actively participating? The double standards are wild. We protest because Canada’s support does make a difference, just like it did in other conflicts. Israel must be proud of what they’ve accomplished—Canadians like you are a perfect reflection of their government’s selective empathy.

you also said that left or right ends up with dead jews, but left wing movements have existed and prospered without the pinning of blame of jews. as an example, the ussr. it took until stalin to turn start a mainstream antisemitism wave in the ussr. lenin criticized antisemitism and found it useless for his marxist ideals.

The conversation always take such wild turns when a person tries to defend Israel’s actions. At what point do you acknowledge the numbers as facts? It is a nation breaking international laws (https://www.icj-cij.org/node/204176) and committing many atrocious war crimes.

Both sides have done their fair share of warcrimes.

Pretending this conflict started on Oct 7th is disengenous and overlooks decades of conflict and  oppression

That being said I do think the responce has been disproportionate. I understand that urbanwarfare inevitably leads to higher casualties but I think the leadership of Isreal has shown clear intent that in the future might well be deemed enough to lable this a genocide. While I cant make a claim that hamas has never used civilians as shields (theres evidence they have) I think Isreal does uses that as an excuse strike any and all targets they may choose, they dont have a high burden of proof if one exists at all.

This is all without mentioning that any civillian who chooses to defend themself, their home, or just happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time can be labled an Hamas fighter and killed with impunity. Yes at that point they are a ""combatants"" but whats exactly is their alternernative? Would you not fight to defend your home and the people you love or at the very least yourself?

This is a horrible situation and neither side is ""in the right"", however, I do believe that if it continues as its going (and it looks like it will) it will eventually be recognized as a genocide.

There needs to be a distinction between actively and passively using human shields.

Yeah, you can review the above reel and dive deeper if you need to. The UN is complicit in the 10/7 attacks via UNRWA and hires members of Hamas unions to teach kindergarten children to hate Israel and kill Jews. They train them that martyrdom is a worthy cause.
