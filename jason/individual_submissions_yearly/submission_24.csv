Steer clear of CDN355 with Siobhan O'Flynn; she'll drag your grades down even if you do nothing,Difficult_Pie6306,1csu2zc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1csu2zc/steer_clear_of_cdn355_with_siobhan_oflynn_shell/,1715802840.0,"Here's the situation. The first assignment in this class was a 15% short essay. Siobhan O'Flynn gave me a passing score, saying my grade was significantly reduced because one paraphrase wasn't the original author's viewpoint.

Of course, I believed the original author expressed the viewpoint, so I sent a Quercus inbox message explaining this (she said she would respond much slower compared to email, very old-school). I didn't include one word of a regrading in the message at all, just clarification. In the message, I quoted the original text and provided more detailed reasoning. However, after reading the message, the professor lowered my grade to 40%.

This in itself is outrageous: without any changes to the assignment, simply because a student tried to explain, the professor lowered the grade from passing to failing.

But it doesn't end there; within 40 minutes, my grade was further reduced to 30%, and during that time, I did nothing, and the original submission didn't change at all.

I believe that if a professor has such power, simply shutting students' mouths and giving them 0 would be better. I believe students have the right to explain their motivation in their work without fearing their marks being taken away.

Furthermore, the grading scheme and project instructions are unclear, even though she can talk about them for more than 2 hours each class(rambling); also, she asks students to sign an academic integrity statement at the beginning of the term and once for every subsequent assignment, which is unnecessarily stupid. I can't believe someone is still doing this in 2024, requiring a total of 5 academic integrity checklists for one class.

In summary, avoid this professor.

Lastly, the course itself seems decent; it has no tests or exams and will cover data visualization and practical chart tools later on.

# Update as of May 16, 2024, 12:34 AM EDT:

Originally, I just wanted to share my story and help other people who want to select CDN355 in the future, since I didn't find much information about the professor and the course, and I'm not responsible for providing evidence. But now there are requests for posting copies. I can still take screeshots since there is a delay before the course content becomes invisible for me on Quercus. I believe that providing more necessary content would help, so I'll do this. I removed parts where it would be inappropriate to post here.

I also posted those redundant academic integrity checklists. However, posting the essay, rubric, and syllabus would violate school policy, so I won't do it.

Academic integrity checklists

The way she insists on her holy highest academic standards may be a better fit for an essay lawyer than a teacher. I believe that even someone who wrote a 3-page essay with random opinions, citing only 1 sentence from each source she provided, would receive a grade higher than 30%. She should reduce the distance between herself and her students, not just in the news (what she tried to do. I saw pictures of her standing alongside students in several news articles).

Aside from this point, some comments mentioned that Rate My Professor website is unreliable and provided a link to prove it (with a low-score professor's research). RMP scores would be another debate, but it's just a simple mention here. While I think its anonymity may introduce bias, much like the internet, it's a platform for students to provide opinions, and it's understandable that a bad professor would not be happy with it (who has a very low score). I just want to ask: would any of you, as a genuine student, prefer a professor rated 2.1/5.0, 2.8/5.0, or even as high as 3.5/5.0 over those higher than 4? Would you choose a professor with low ratings, not drop the course, and not use CR/NCR, believe in your extraordinary strength to earn a fair grade from any grader and to have a pleasant class experience?

# Update as of May 16, 2024, 2:25 PM EDT:

There are so many comments going on now; I read them and couldn’t get back to each one of them, but I appreciate your concerns and advice. I have received updates from at least four other students who are currently enrolled in the class and are experiencing difficulties with her.

Here’s the quote from one of the classmates:

“When I asked her to clarify the assignment requirements, she scolded me. But when some classmates asked her anonymously, she pretended to be very patient in her responses. When I asked her a question via email, she didn't answer it. But when someone else asked the same question in class, she said, ’Oh, I just noticed this, thank you.’

For the assignment, there was no problem with my citations, and she didn't give any constructive feedback on what I did wrong; she just insisted that my ideas were problematic. She always runs over time in class, claiming it's office hours, but during office hours, she talks about techniques needed for the final. She shouldn't be in academia; she should be an actress.”

Another student received low marks on the essay and unconstructive feedback such as only “vague statements.” There have already been 14 people dropping out in just a few days, the full capacity of this class is 36.

Since it’s not only my problem here, I feel bearing a responsibility to push this thing further. I sent an email to the Woodsworth Registrar, and they replied that they can issue a full refund for the course, but I don’t care about that now. I already saw someone suggest going to the department chair and even the dean’s office, and I am doing this. This thing had filled my mind; I was very awake and couldn't sleep well last night. I'm doing something that I have never done before.

If someone sees this and is currently enrolled in this class, just email the department or registrar; it will help.

This is the passage I just found on the UofT website, just to let students know their rights. The formal process is that even if you have plagiarized, the professor cannot impose a penalty. This official passage just defines her conduct as violating the policy.

# Update as of May 17, 2024, 1:58 AM EDT:

I have just finished sending the email to the vice-dean (it was long, I hope I can sleep better today) and noticed that a commenter suspected to be O'Flynn appears:

https://preview.redd.it/cr1zbfe6ex0d1.png?width=1182&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4ebab1b2178b9c974340da55aa8d4e9e7d6ad45

After hearing about more difficult times experienced by other students with her, I simply don't want to argue with such a hilarious statement. Hi, O'Flynn, do you think people care about your A in the course like you care about your director title? Accusing someone of helping others of whining is almost as stupid as saying that people go to university solely to get As in their courses. Oh, yeah, you might have just made discriminatory remarks about high school students.

# Update as of May 20, 2024, 11:55 AM EDT:

It turns more obvious now.

Another classmate from CDN355 messaged me today. Siobhan O’Flynn didn’t even finish reading her essay, missed the classmate’s citation, and claimed that she plagiarized. The classmate sent a long email to Siobhan O’Flynn to explain, but Siobhan O’Flynn neither listened to nor trusted her. After dropping CDN355, Siobhan O’Flynn threatened her by saying, “You have to finish the rest of the assignments whether you dropped the course or not” (not the original quote).

This time, Siobhan O’Flynn didn’t lower the mark but sent the assignment to the academic unit after the classmate dropped the course. Clearly, she now knows not to penalize students privately; this is tantamount to admitting that she violated the policy in my case. I confirmed with the classmate that she did not plagiarize.

The slots are now 15:

https://preview.redd.it/cxn203zmvl1d1.png?width=1774&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bc7e5cfa18933b3058b23e70f737ece05e10556

At this point, I suggest that everyone enrolled in CDN355 drop the course. There is no value in keeping it. Today is the last day to drop a course with a 75% refund. You can ask your College Registrar for a 100% refund by telling them what Siobhan O’Flynn has done.

I sent an email to the academic unit notifying them of what O’Flynn has done to help that classmate. I also received an email from the vice-dean stating that I will hear from him in the coming days, so there should be results this week.

One of my RMP ratings got deleted, I guess it's because someone reported it. Some comments in my thread seem to have an unchangeable standpoint rather than being reasonable; just feel them:

# Update as of May 21, 2024, 12:37 PM EDT:

Vice-Dean Randy Boyagoda just replied to me this morning, basically saying he had a talk with Siobhan O'Flynn and is satisfied with her plan for continued teaching. As far as my case goes, I guess that will be it.

One last thing I want to say is that I am probably the first person who drew the faculty's attention to Siobhan O'Flynn. If anyone in the future sees this thread and encounters difficulties with her, it will be a lot easier for you to send emails to the school to report her (for example, in BMS100 next semester; I would suggest not taking her classes). I believe if that really happens, she will face more serious consequences.",submission,535

Firstly, the Quercus thing. Some profs are famous for never putting in grades on Quercus. I suspect its a minor error on the portal’s end and I suspect you still had your original grade. Profs dont deduct marks like that and if they did, you can take it up with the faculty. They cant do that.

Secondly, you gotta show us your submission and your rubric. Ive graded short papers in the past and nothing is more transparent than those two pieces of information

She is the one who does not give a shit about students lives. Please report it to the department; she should be fired from UofT and be away from schools forever!  Also, I feel like I'm just writing essays for the purpose of making professors happy for most humanities courses, since I need to write what they want to see to get high grades.

The prof is clearly reducing your grade because they think you borderline plagiarized. I’d be happy it wasn’t worse than that. There’s almost always a clause in the syllabus saying if you ask the prof to take another look they reserve the right to change your grade even if that means lowering it.

One thing that I would recommend doing next time is to bring things up with a department head. I struggled severely with NMC198 because the prof wouldn’t say what she’s expecting and that tanked my grade. I went to the department head and while I didn’t get a regrade despite my request, she clarified what she’s expecting because the department head contacted her.

In other words, most of the time, spending plenty of time on problems gives me higher grades.  If tests and exams are hard and averages are low, nearly all the professors in the science field that i encounter at UofT will curve up.  However, in the humanities, you could get 75 when you put all your blood into essay writing when professors are narrow-minded (especially when they expect your essays to include certain arguments).  You could skip all the readings and easily get a high grade when your answers are what they expect.  Writing essays is about pushing students to think critically, not trying to figure out what professors expect.  And this is not just me, most of my friends hold the same views.  Speaking of the course CDN355, this is not about the course workload.  THIS PROFESSOR IS MONONTONE AND MEAN!  Giving a student 30 percent of an assignment?  Also, look at her wording, ""The grade is now lowered. “ For fk's sake, respect is mutual, that is literally a taunt, and doing this to a student in 300-level courses might easily screw their lives and destroy their entire days.  Also, you are talking about giving students special treatment.  Emailing professors when students believe they meet the requirements of assignments means special treatment?  Let me tell you what the actual special treatments look like.  I am an international student, and English is not my first language.  And I email the professor to ask whether they could bump up my grade based on that, this is asking for special treatment.",comment,1

Because the number of students is much lower than in CS, and if they are always strict with prerequisites, nobody would enroll in their courses, and UofT would cancel their whole departments? It also just proves my point they allow students to take upper-year classes for their own interests, in other words, making money.",comment,1

I know because I am also an instructor. Even if I suspect my students of cheating, I cannot just reduce their mark because I think they are guilty. Even the most obvious cases of cheating need to be referred to department chair and/or Faculty/Division. 

> the OP posted a rant and there is nothing there that shows anyone is being punished for anything.

Are you being intentionally dense LOL? The screenshots that OP provided clearly show that the prof was issuing a grade reduction

> OP got caught plagiarizing and cheating

There is nothing wrong with the prof suspecting or believing that the student plagiarized. This is not my point. My point is that there is a procedure they must follow, but the screenshots clearly show that they did not do so, according to the rules in the links that YOU provided",comment,2

a person that hasn't read the readings. don't understand the readings. hasn't invested the time and effort to read or understand the readings. doesn't understand what they are writing about. doesn't understand how to express what they are writing about in the written form. does not read and has not read what good writing looks like.   
  
that is usually what results in bad writing. it has nothing to do with subjective opinion.

If you don't understand what i am writing bout. maybe explore the  Best American Science and Nature Writing series or other similar series.
