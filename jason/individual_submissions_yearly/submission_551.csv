I'm a graduate student at UofT, and I'm a trans woman who's been thinking of going to the Athletic Centre for a while, or another gym on campus. I'm a bit worried about hostile responses, being told to leave the space/etc., especially since I don't intend to wear makeup at the gym, so I won't ""pass"" perfectly.

Is that something I should be worried about at UofT? If any others (especially other trans people) can share anything out of the ordinary you've experienced, please do!",submission,40

I prefer going to the Goldring centre over the Athletic centre due to its modern gym amenities. Also citing from the Goldring centre:

[“There are alternate change rooms available for any user at the far end of the hallway: the Accessible Change Room, All Gender, and Family Change Room. Both have shower and washroom amenities inside the area. Lockers for these change rooms are just around the corner.“](https://kpe.utoronto.ca/facility/goldring-centre-high-performance-sport)",comment,74

It has individual locking changerooms within a bigger change room, but the shower area is in the common space - you are also required to be clothed at all times in the common space, so I have to shower in a bathing suit after working out. 

Not well thought out at all. I’m very androgynous presenting and post top-op so get weird looks in both women’s and men’s change rooms. Unfortunately the sitch is AC is really lacking in that way.",comment,26

When I’ve asked specifically about change rooms I was recommended the ones around the pool area but you still have to go through the gendered main changerooms to get there. 

I use the women’s change room (I’m just too lazy to go to the other ones lol) and haven’t had any bad experiences, but I pass as a gnc cis woman. I’ve changed there with a friend of mine a few times who’s more visibly trans (eg. has some facial hair) and nobody bothered us. I’ve generally not had issues at the AC but again I’m likely read as a gnc cis woman and I’m also transmasculine, so your experience might be different as a trans woman! 

I’m not sure what kinds of exercise you’re looking to do but there’s a weekly free group exercise class I’m in for trans people called Impact Proud!  https://kpe.utoronto.ca/sport-recreationrecreational-fitness-drop-sportsgroup-fitness-workouts/impact-proud It’s a super welcoming environment with a lot of trans people, we mostly do weightlifting and body weight exercises. The AC also has trans-only swim hours if that interests you :) https://kpe.utoronto.ca/drop-trans-pool-hours

I find overall the AC does okay with gender-neutral change spaces (you kind of have to seek them out) but has relatively good trans-inclusive programming, I don’t think Goldring or Hart House have any trans-specific stuff like the AC",comment,4

it is definitely a tricky situation, the whole point of gender segregated changerooms is to make people feel comfortable changing in public, though obviously gay and lesbian people exist too. not saying any gender orientation of sexuality is predisposed to committing sexual abuse (and what a stupid notion that is) but for now I think it is safer just to seek out unisex changerooms instead",comment,3
