I spotted this sign today for the first time on my floor in New College and I'm wondering what exactly is going on here?? After the multiple cases of SA/perversion that occurred here last year, AND the training course that was required this summer to even enroll in NC, how is this still happening??

As it's not my dorm, nor someone I personally know, I'm wondering if there's anything I might be able to do about this/if it's my place to. But I wanted to post this here to hopefully get the word out to others that disgusting acts like this haven't stopped here at NC.",submission,190
