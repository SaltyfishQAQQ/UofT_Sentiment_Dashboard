I would say JRE300 (its the harder end of bird courses but still), I would suggest taking it in summer although difficulty remains more or less the same. 

The course is relatively straight forward, best part is usually you only lose 0.5 marks where you think you should’ve lost 3-5 🤣. 

It does require attending lectures for the content and practicing quite a bit before the exams. But relatively, in summer, its just 2 exam 2 assignment and that’s all.",comment,1

Also, for incoming first years my advise to find cool courses is to scroll on the first yr seminars page. 

My recommendation for a non/seminar bird course is POL106 - Democracy in the Social Media Age, it’s super interesting and there are only 3 essay assignments (no exam). My controversial rec would be PHL100, but only if you’re into humanities and like philosophy.",comment,1

A lot of it stems around how humans subconsciously adapt religious belief into film, and how we can use the idea of religon as a framework to better understand different films, like LOTR and Ghost in the shell. There’s a module on sci-fi movies and another on scapegoating that were rlly good. I acc had a fun time writing the literature review bc David let us choose whatever topic we wanted and I did an analysis on Christianity is some strange movies lol, but that may differ depending on the prof.
