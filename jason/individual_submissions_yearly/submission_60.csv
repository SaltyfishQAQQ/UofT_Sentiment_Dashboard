Went from failing BCH210 to being accepted to medical school—hang in there,ilovebrianmay,1g2v2jo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g2v2jo/went_from_failing_bch210_to_being_accepted_to/,1728840910.0,"To anyone who may need a pick me up:

6 years ago I was a student at UofT, diagnosed with depression, was suicidal, had to get emergency surgery in the middle of taking BCH210, my dad was briefly homeless after my parents divorced; everything in my personal life felt like it was falling apart. I got a D+ in CHM136, scored consistently at or below average in almost all my classes, and had to withdraw from BCH210 to avoid failing.

I had gone back and forth with the idea of becoming a physician for some time, and after some eye opening experiences with the health care system, I decided for sure that I wanted to pursue medicine. At UofT, I was told by advisors and admission directors to look at other options as my chances of getting into medical school were essentially zero.

During COVID, I transferred. I started attending a small school in the states where I was able to meet with registrar who actually knew my name and what I wanted to do. I felt like a failure for transferring. I got access to free therapy, and met with my therapist every week for 5 years. I re evaluated the classist and elitist views that convinced me I was a failure for leaving UofT. I worked full time in a hospital on top of taking a full course load to pay for classes. I pulled all nighters, and almost dropped out b/c financially it was just too much to handle at times. I studied my a$$ off. I learned a new language and started volunteering as an interpreter at health outreach programs. I joined a research lab and presented at a national conference. I took the MCAT. I graduated summa cum laude. I started working as a research coordinator at an Ivy League hospital. I retook the MCAT (and scored in the 90th percentile in the biochemistry/biology section). I improved my relationship with my mom, and became an aunt. 

This past week, I got my first acceptance letter to medical school. 

If nobody has told you today—you are not a failure. The only time you fail is when you stop learning. You should be proud of yourself and everything you have accomplished. 

It’s a privilege to be able to chase your dreams, so do it while/if you can. YOU are in the driver’s seat of your own life. Prestigious schools like UofT sometimes have a way of preying on young and insecure students (like us) by making us believe we NEED them to be successful. Nah. YOU do what YOU need to do to accomplish your goals, whether UofT is supportive of those goals and helps you get there is up to them.",submission,319

Honestly a big thing I’ve learned from this process is the person next to you might be/seem smarter but if you’ve got persistence that’ll take you further than smarts can alone. So I honestly mean it, props to you!",comment,3

A lot of my friends from UofT definitely have a different situation than my own and I’m privileged to have dual citizenship. Also having a family that was somewhat supportive of my decision to transfer helped, although they definitely weren’t happy lol.

What I hope people take away from this is that people at UofT can have you convinced that the road to med school, grad school, etc looks a specific way and can’t involve “failure”. It definitely can, and I encourage people to be open minded and consider all their options even if they’re not as glamorous as, idk, specializing in biochem at UofT.

Personally UofT had me feeling like I was getting further from my goals the longer I was staying there. I needed help snapping out of the elitist mindset I was in that was keeping me there, but when I did I realized I could get what I needed from my education somewhere else, and did that. My friends that transferred to Queens or Ryerson (TMU) felt the same way. Some might call it being a failure or not being able to handle the rigor; imo that’s the elitism talking, I call it being strategic. There is such thing as suffering for no reason. 

Obviously everybody’s different, take what applies to your situation.",comment,7
