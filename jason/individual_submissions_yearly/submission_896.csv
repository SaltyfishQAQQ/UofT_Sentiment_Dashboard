Please lmk which would be giving me the most workload out of both. I haven’t heard much about Stanford’s work being too stressful, although I’ve seen way more comments on how UofT is extremely rigorous and stuff. I just want the answer to that question without any bias of “more” or “less” opportunities. What’s overall easier in general to any major that is not strictly in the stem field.

Edit: I think uoft is the easier school (not here to talk about any rankings of both or obviously Stanford would win that, im just talking about the workload aspect of both schools)",submission,15

U of T workload is high and so is Stanford's.  We are all doing an intensive grad program at MIT and are finding the workload manageable, whereas people from other schools are being overwhelmed, so I'm assuming the workload is comparable between the two schools. 

The fundamental difference is that Stanford has grade inflation and U of T has grade deflation. Stanford's attitude is that if you were smart enough to get in, we aren't going to place a bell curve on super talented people. U of T for many of their programs has lower admission standards compared to Stanford, and actively tries to weed you out.  Grade deflation is the reality at U of T, even in the competitive programs that are hard to get into.

If I were you, I'd go to Stanford.  It is more expensive, but the opportunities being in Silicon Valley with a degree that is more internationally recognized far outweigh what U of T has to offer.  Plus if you decide to pursue post-graduate work, the Stanford name and grade inflation will get you into any prestigious program in the world.",comment,50

To this I would add there are 5 Ontario universities where the top students concentrate: U of T, Waterloo, McMaster, Western and Queen's.  87% of UTSG students, 81% of Western and around 75% of Waterloo, Western and Queen's have 90+ averages.  And about 70% across the three U of T campuses.  But I don't think even a 90 is so rarified now: around half of TMU and Guelph grads do (vast majority in the 90-94 range).  If you use a 95 cutoff then half of UTSG, one third of all U of T and around 40% at Waterloo, McMaster, Western and Queen's meet the standard.  This data is available from CUDO.


I'm guessing the median student at the five most selective Ontario universities is probably around the 90th percentile.  While at HYP,  MIT and Stanford the median student is at around the 99.5th percentile.


Perhaps U of T undergrads (70,000 in a province of 15 million) on the whole can be compared to the University of California system (233,000 in a state of 40 million).",comment,1

I remember when I applied the official cut off was listed as ""low to mid 80s"" but I know those numbers usually vastly underestimate the real acceptance averages. I did meet some people in the program that had mid 80 averages and no special conditions, so I assumed a mid 80 was usually enough to get in since the physics and math program is not super competitive.",comment,0

There is an enormous difference between having paid deposits etc for dorm and meal plan and having paid months worth of rent and food and tuition. 

You’re not too into it. It’s not late. Trust me you’ll regret it. Defer your Stanford acceptance and take a gap year if you need to. That will enable you to focus on your future much better.",comment,1
