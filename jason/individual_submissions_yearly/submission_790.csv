Got caught sneaking a friend into Panam Center with my T card_What should I expect? ,Judgment_Murky,1h22jp6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h22jp6/got_caught_sneaking_a_friend_into_panam_center/,1732818867.0,"I did a stupid and got caught sneaking a friend into the gym with my own student card. I got an infraction and my gym membership got suspended. I've already arranged a meeting with the staff, but what kind of penalties should I expect if this is my first time?

UPDATE: Phone call with a Ms Candice Pope. She asked me to recount what happened, went over the policies regarding guests, and told me not to do it again basically. Gym membership was supposedly unsuspended on the same day, have yet to test. 

Overall, if there's another panicked redditor reading this later on, be honest about what happened on the phone call (it looks like the staff gave her their own rundown of the events in a report) and obviously be apologetic. This was my first time doing this, can't say that this would be the same for a repeat offender. 

This caused me so much trouble I'd honestly recommend just paying the day pass for the other person....",submission,20

He got expelled at the end of the year. No refund, no notice, nothing. He was told everything was fine and hadnâ€™t even thought of it for months. Just got a notice at the end of the year. Whatâ€™s worse is he paid the next semester tuition already. 

They donâ€™t play about this at all. His first infraction btw admin gets really strict about stuff like this. Itâ€™s unfair man but I guess you canâ€™t change the past.",comment,0

Iâ€™d say thereâ€™s no chance of a permanent ban or academic penalty as long as youâ€™re remorseful and show that you understand your mistake was wrong. They need to know that you wonâ€™t abuse the T-card system since ya know itâ€™s not only used for panam access but also used for exams and whatnot. I wouldnâ€™t worry too much though, just tell them your side of the story and apologize about your mistake. Should be a slap on the wrist.",comment,9

I've not been in trouble much in high school so I guess the staff at the front desk and all the suspension talk just scared the shit out of me lol.
