Electrical engineering was genuinely my top choice. I find electromagnetism, semi conductors, power generation all of that interesting. I accepted my offer for uw since I liked it better. But now from judging from peopleâ€™s opinion on Reddit ðŸ’€, Iâ€™m realising that Waterloo may not be a good option for my field of interests and apparently there is not much coop for electrical engineering, thereâ€™s more for computer engineering instead. Is Uoft the better choice? Guys what do I do ??? Iâ€™m scared Iâ€™m gonna regret my choice. ",submission,21

Meaning that you can literally just choose to be comp after those 2 years, also when it comes to co-op Iâ€™d say there is 0 difference between the universities other than Waterloo forces you and UofT does not. The portals are similar and opportunities similar as well, it all depends on your skillset as an individual and your network.",comment,7

Ultimately in my opinion work experience is stronger then the university you come from.

As long as you take courses of computer Engineering classes such as software option, or network options.

UofT EE give you options to free switch to computer engineering or stay  in Eletrical Engeering. You can keep

options open.

However, i heard it's almost impossible to switch between ECE in UofWaterloo. You are almost locked in EE in Waterloo.",comment,0
