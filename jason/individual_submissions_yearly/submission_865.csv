where should i go if iâ€™m having issues with one of my TAs?,DifferentFlatworm773,1h0qxeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h0qxeq/where_should_i_go_if_im_having_issues_with_one_of/,1732665966.0,in one of my courses we have an extremely harsh TA who pretty much everyone in my class has an issue with. He grades very unfair and takes marks off for the most random reasons and is very hypocritical with the feedback he gives us even when we follow his exact instructions on how to submit the assignment. People have talked to our prof about him and he said he canâ€™t do anything about it. I donâ€™t know what else to do about it cus it feels so unfair that heâ€™s made so many students extremely disappointed with their marks and heâ€™s just allowed to do this.,submission,18

Apparently they simply don't want to bother. They can certainly discuss your feedback with the TA, and you can also ask for a reevaluation from the prof. Get other people complain to the prof about the same problem, maybe they'll listen.Â  Although it might be the bell curve problem. The uni wants the grades to be in 70% range, so often professors themselves instruct TA to grade in such a manner so that the average would be in this range. So if everyone is doing great, the grader has to mark more harshly to fit in the range ðŸ¤¡",comment,9
