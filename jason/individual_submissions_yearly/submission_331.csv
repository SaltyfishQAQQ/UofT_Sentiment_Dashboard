A Review of Every Course I Took at UofT During Undergrad ('24),iromatsuurii,1djuf1s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1djuf1s/a_review_of_every_course_i_took_at_uoft_during/,1718832066.0,"Since I’m graduating this week and used Reddit extensively in planning out my courses throughout my degree, I wanted to make this post (inspired by the posts made by u/garbageslutt and u/btam0408 last year) to also give back and help others who might want more insight on some courses!

For context, I completed a MGY major and two other life science minors. I started in 2020 though so **big disclaimer** that half my degree was online and as such, my experiences with/thoughts about most courses taken between Fall 2020 and Winter 2022 may not reflect in-person experiences with/thoughts about these courses. I also remember much less about courses I took earlier lol

# Year 1 (Fully Online)

**Fall 2020**

BIO120 (J. Stinchcombe, M. Frederickson) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Profs were great (esp Prof. Stinchcombe) and the content felt like a review of some high school topics and wasn’t too difficult overall. The tests were also marked pretty fairly from what I remember. The scientific proposal assignment was kind of a pain though IMO but you get through it.

CHM135 (S. Browning) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* If you took AP Chem in high school, this is pretty much that. This course featured rotating profs and while I found the tests a little challenging, the labs were easy enough to complete and were grade boosters.

MAT135 (S. Mayes-Tang, B. Galvão-Sousa) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Draws from high school calculus and builds on it, the only reason I did well in the course was because it was online and because of the marking scheme/divisions making each individual weekly quiz worth little overall. Definitely milk every mark you can from the ACTs though because they are Very easy marks compared to the rest of the evaluations in the course.

PSY100 (P. Whissell) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* If you took AP Psych in high school, this is basically a review of that and a pretty straightforward course overall. Prof. Whissell is an amazing lecturer though and tests and marks very fairly: memorize All his slides and their content and you’ll be able to hit 70% at the very least–the rest of the marks are just being able to contextualize things and apply them (a very standard life sci course in that sense).

EAS120Y1 (Y. Tomita) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* This was definitely a fun course to take but not easy or bird-y by any means. You really have to put in the work to learn the language as the course progresses as topics build up on each other and it can be v easy to fall behind. The teaching staff overall were really great for this course though and the format of the tutorials was nice because it helps you to really meet and interact with others in the class–good vibes overall.

First-Year Learning Community (FLC)

* Not actually a course but I enrolled in it because a then-co-worker recommended it to me. Although everything was online, the FLC was nice in that it pre-enrolled me into my core courses so I didn’t have to worry about those and could just focus on getting into my desired electives. Some of the programming was really helpful though, like learning how to get involved with my college and hearing about the experiences of upper-year students firsthand.

**Winter 2021**

BIO130 (M. Neumann, D. Goring, K. Yip) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Also kind of similar to Grade 12 Bio, pretty straightforward overall with a good amount of memorization needed. There was one large overarching group lab project that was a little bit tedious but not terrible. Prof. Yip was especially great, 10/10.

CHM136 (K. Quinlan) - Crs. Avg: **C+**; My Average: **Above**

* Similar to CHM135 with the rotating profs but much harder in terms of the content IMO. Doing the practice problems is a Must.

MAT136 (S. Mayes-Tang, B. Galvão-Sousa) - Crs. Avg: **A-**; My Average: **Above**

* Again, I only did well in this course because it was online and the ACTs helped to boost my mark haha

GGR124 (N. Lombardo) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* A Reddit-declared bird course that I decided to take. It was pretty straightforward from what I remember and the tests and assignments were marked pretty fairly–not a bad bird course if you’re not writing-adverse. The prof was also a great lecturer IMO.

**Summer 2021**

PSY201 (B. Hong) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty straightforward course that was taught by a grad student. This one feels like a good stats course to take should you need one/don’t want a terribly deep intro to stats.

PSY220 (W. Huggon) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty decent 200-level PSY course, the prof was pretty cool. There was an experiment proposal-type assignment that I remember being pretty tedious though and it was marked kinda stringently.

# Year 2 

**Fall 2021 (Fully Online EXCEPT for HMB265 tutorials and examinations)**

BCH210 (S. Patterson) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* A very detail-heavy course in the weekly quizzes from what I remember. The assignments definitely helped to save my mark in this one and even then, those were also an absolute pain to get through (although their general concepts were interesting).

BIO230 (K. Yip, H. McFarlane) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty much BIO130 with a little more detail, always worth taking courses with Prof. Yip if you can haha

HMB265 (N. Levy-Strumpf, B. Chang) - Crs. Avg: **C+**; My Average: **Above**

* This course draws from high school genetics and the first half taught by Prof. Levy-Strumpf was pretty straightforward. The following half absolutely tanked my grade and I will never forget or forgive it. Your experience in the tutorials will vary depending on your TA–the TA I had was not great IMO and it def did not help my impression of the course. I’ve heard that they’ll be revamping the course in the following semesters with different instructors though so some good changes should be incoming.

IMM250 (L. Clemenza) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Widely touted as a bird course, this one’s good if you don’t mind brute memorization + have a decent amount of bio knowledge (I wouldn’t recommend taking it in first year but that's just me). There was an essay assignment in the course when I took it but even that wasn’t marked too harshly.

PSL201Y (M. French) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Also a brute memorization-type course with rotating profs for different body systems. The assignments were very much free marks though and felt like they were at best high school-level assignments (probably to help buffer marks possibly lost during the tests).

**Winter 2022 (Fully Online EXCEPT for MGY200 lectures and examinations, PSY230 had an optional in-person lecture component)**

BCH311 (S. Andreopoulos) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Same**

* A Very detail-heavy course in a similar sense to BCH210 but more intense. I don’t remember v much from this course other than that I didn’t have the best time here (the content gets a little boring at times but you’re expected to know all of it).

BIO220 (J. Stinchcombe, N. Mideo) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Very similar to BIO120 as it covers EEB-type content. Both profs were great, assessments were marked fairly, no complaints.

MGY200 (P. Roy, M. Taipale) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* A pretty straightforward intro to MoGen, no surprises with the marking and the essays were easy to complete and very fairly marked.

PSY230 (A. Sharples) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Good intro to personality psych and was never overwhelming in terms of content. The personality assessment essay was actually a p fun one to write and the prof was really great and understanding with her extension policy. The use of Pachback was a little tedious but it was easy marks overall.

**Summer 2022**

IMM340 (J. Singh) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Basically the same concepts from IMM250 but taught in a little more detail, the assignments were pretty easy.

IMM350 (L. Clemenza) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Same idea as IMM350 lol

# Year 3 (Fully In-Person!)

**Fall 2022**

MGY314 (J. Hill, B. Lavoie) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Took this course as per Reddit’s suggestion as a lab course and while it definitely wasn’t a walk in the park, it was a great intro to genetics lab work and was really fun overall! The profs and TAs were really supportive all throughout the course (especially the TAs) and made the whole experience really great! Workload/time-wise, it was a little heavy, especially towards the end of the semester and you really do need to put in the time and effort to know the material. Definitely recommend this course though!

MGY340 (B. Lavoie, A. Spence, J. Brill) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Same**

* It can be confusing at times if you don’t already have a research background because they draw so heavily from past/current research and experiments but it was a pretty solid genetics course. Everything was marked fairly and they were good about teaching the concepts they tested thoroughly (no terrible surprises on any evaluations).

MGY377 (W. Navarre, A. Davidson) - Crs. Avg: **C+**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty much a brute memorization course (and then some) so it did get overwhelming with times with the sheer amount of content being presented. That being said, none of the concepts were terribly complicated so it’s not too bad provided you put in the work to keep up. The profs are both great lecturers with great senses of humour, def worth taking for them lol

MGY380 (J. Liu) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Very straightforward lab course with most marks coming from lab reports and then two evaluations. Since I had no lab experience before this semester (COVID), I found it super beginner friendly and the TAs were great supports. I will say that they were really nitpicky in marking the lab reports: they expected a great deal of detail in all of the sections. If you take this course in the future, be sure to ask your TA for help/support/a rubric so that you hit all the points you need to on your reports. If picking a lab course for MGY reqs, between this one and 314, this one is definitely easier.

**Winter 2023**

EEB125 (T. Parins-Fukuchi, D. Liu, S. Caetano) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Took this course because I saw it being recommended here and I think of the courses that I took based off of Reddit suggestions, this one was my absolute favourite. Super beginner-friendly Python course that was straightforward and clear with assignments and expectations AND had an amazingly supportive teaching team. Wasn’t an EEB, STA, or CSC student but did have moments where I wished I was because all three of the profs were stellar lecturers and had really good vibes in general! Office hours were really great for getting help with problem sets because the TAs always helped walk me through them when I got stuck/helped me debug my code. 

MGY350 (B. Derry, I. Scott, J. Moffat) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Below** (B-)

* I looked at both past exams and Reddit comments when deciding to take this course and it didn’t seem that bad at first glance. However, if you’re not in a specialist program (eg. MGY, IMM, BCH, CSB, etc) and/or don’t have previous research experience at the time you’re taking the course, the learning curve is a sizable one IMO. The profs were chill and good lecturers but also assumed a lot of background knowledge on lab techniques that someone who hadn’t taken “specialist” courses like MGY311 probably wouldn’t have. A good course for learning more about research and how experiments are constructed though.

MGY470 (M. Wilson) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty straightforward course with multiple lecturers that gives you a taste of different topics in genetics. Assignments and tests were very fair, pretty much just memorization for the latter. Would recommend if you’re looking for an easier 400-level MGY course.

PSY424 (M. Metz) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Loved the content and the professor’s lecturing/teaching style made it an especially great course. Prof. Metz was very good about setting clear expectations for assignments and giving tips on how to do well on them which was super valuable given that pretty much all of the evaluations were written (1 major writing assignment and 2 take-home written evaluations).

# Year 4

**Fall 2023  (Fully In-Person EXCEPT for MGY277)**

BPM232 (A. Djedovic) - **CR** (B+ when I CR’d after getting Essay/Test 1 marks and participation marks returned)

* A friend recommended this one to me in first year but I could only fit it into my schedule this semester. However, the course was a lot different from what they’d described since the prof was a new one. He was really chill but the lectures just went on forever and it didn’t feel like there was a ton of flow between topics. The assignments and evaluations were simple enough though, I CR’d at the end only because I didn’t want to risk dropping my GPA by landing on the lower end of the B+/A- boundary lol

CDN355 (S. O’Flynn) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* I took this one because I saw comments saying this course was a decent elective on Reddit and found it to be pretty straightforward overall with three assignments/mini-projects, some in-class discussion, and a larger final project IIRC. I’d say you get what you put into the course–by no means were the assignments difficult but I definitely had to put some time and effort into them. The assignments were enjoyable overall though and I personally found learning about/how to use different digital media tools to be fun.
* One major gripe I did have with the course was how subjective the marking was ESPECIALLY because the professor never uploaded rubrics onto the assignment pages, making expectations super unclear. If taking this course in the future, I’d recommend asking for a rubric to be posted for every assignment or at least clear expectations to be set. Otherwise, Professor O’Flynn herself was a good professor IMO– I found her lectures to be engaging and she was super generous with her assignment extension policy throughout the course which I really appreciated.

HMB302 (R. Wilson Jr.) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* This course was pretty straightforward and you really get what you put into this one. Lots of memorization in this one, not just of the functions of specific cell types/tissues but also how they appear in slides visually since you have to draw and label things with explanations of their function (don’t worry if you’re not a great artist though). Prof Wilson Jr is a great lecturer though and along with the TAs, genuinely cared about the success of students throughout the course. Don’t skip his lectures because oftentimes, he dropped hints on what would be on evaluations during them!

MGY277 (J. Hill) - Crs. Avg: **B+**; My Average: **Above**

* Very very straightforward and easy course. Because it was online and the way it was marked (online quizzes were open book, weekly concept maps were participation marks), achieving between 90-100% in the first 65% of the course was very doable. The exam was also pretty much straight memorization so no crazy surprises. Would recommend taking this one before MGY377 since the latter is basically this course’s content but elaborated on further. If you choose the hard way and do 377 before 277, it will be an absolute cakewalk.

PSY390 (P. Whissell) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Whissell is the GOAT part two, this one’s a great one especially if you have a genetics background in addition to psych. Similar idea to what I said about PSY100, memorize all the slides and the connections between different concepts and you’re solid. Prof. Whissell does a very good job of making the important concepts and what he wants you to know glaringly obvious whether that be through the study guide he provides or just in lecture lol

**Winter 2024  (In-Person EXCEPT for CLA204 and MGY250)**

CLA204 (N. Neufeld) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* I think this is also one of those courses that is touted here as a bird course but can also really go waywards depending on your interest in the subject/willingness to put effort into it. Given that I had a personal interest in mythology, I found the course to be super interesting. Lots of writing in this course (the majority of the evaluations were written assignments) so if you aren’t a fan, don’t take it (at least with this prof) but if you are, it could be a good grade-booster. I found the lectures to be more than enough for understanding the content–never did the readings and still did really well in the course. 

HMB321 (A. Malinowski) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Another Reddit suggestion I took, I found it pretty easy and straightforward because of my MGY background. Kinda similar to MGY470 in terms of vibes with the rotating guest speakers but with a more focused “storyline”. An enjoyable course overall (I liked it way better than 265), the prof was amazing and super on top of things and the TAs were great too. The assignments and evaluations were also marked pretty fairly. This course is definitely easier if you take it after other genetics courses but is also a good intro to genetics concepts if you haven’t taken other upper-year genetics courses before.

MGY250 (J. Hill) - Crs. Avg: **B**; My Average: **Above**

* Pretty much the same deal with MGY277 but with medical genetics instead lol. Again, if you do this one before 300-level MGY courses, it helps a little bit (not as much as 277 with 377) but if you do it after taking 300-level courses, it will be a cakewalk.

PHL281 (A. Franklin-Hall) - Crs. Avg: **B-**; My Average: **Above**

* Despite being a PHL course, it was super life sci-student friendly (as you’d hope with a bioethics course) and the way the prof presented the content made it especially engaging. The course is pretty writing heavy but essays were still marked pretty generously. Tutorials were also surprisingly enjoyable (1 hour of discussion every week) partly because of the TAs and also partly because you just had to add a point or two into the discussion for participation marks lol

Anyways, one last note of advice: if you aren’t already doing it, download all the lecture content/syllabi from your courses’ Quercus pages so you have them on record since some profs love deleting them right after the semester ends!!!! Hope this all helps lmao",submission,84
