Well I spoke too soon, it was after exams and me and some guy jokingly said if the exam was simple or we think we did good we should kiss. Well guess what, for the first time in history we were actually prepared. We had nothing to lose at this point so outside the exam hall we kissed(Keep in mind we both have never had our first kiss in general). We did a quick peck for the jokes and not failing. Guess what, my crush was there abt to talk to me to ask to hang out b/c she knew I just finished my exam(what her friends told me after at least) well she saw, jaw dropped and decided to just walk away with a somewhat disgusted face. To the girls, am I cooked? To the guys, im not gay right? To her, if you are reading this, techinally u would still be my first kiss(to a girl). I'm sorry but I had to tell someone this.",submission,157
