If you go to where the auditorium is, and keep going east through the doors, you'll see a fully functioning high school. They just did a major reno on that side though, so if you're in classrooms at UTS it might make you mad to see how your classrooms could actually be.",comment,12

UTS gr11 student, there are a few entrances to the building, and the UofT area is seperated from the UTS area with different entrances which is likely why you don't see any students coming and going. The only time I've seen anyone use those doors was for the younger grades' field trips",comment,1
