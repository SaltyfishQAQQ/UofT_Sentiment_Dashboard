If they find anything wrong, they usually just ask for you to meet with somebody and then if you explain yourself it should be fine. Itâ€™s just protocol and they need to send that message whenever their software (which isnâ€™t perfect) gives them any sort of flag. If you did not plagiarize you will be fine",comment,7

Probably an auto email copy-paste that TAs send if a TurnItIn or Original score is higher than a certain threshold. 

Prove itâ€™s your work, and youâ€™ll be fine - if they ever follow up. Might just be an auto send.",comment,2
