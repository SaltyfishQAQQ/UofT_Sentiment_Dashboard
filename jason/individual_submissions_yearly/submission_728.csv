The Centre for Jewish Studies has a mailing list for more scholarly events, but also music and the like. The JCC (Jewish Community Centre) just off campus has a lot of stuff going on, including a lot for young adults. There are a number of synagogues not far from campus, among which Makom seems to have a relatively young membership.",comment,38

Downtown there’s Hillel, and AEPi(rush). Most Jewish groups tend to be kinda underfunded at this school but AEPi does pretty regular Shabbat dinners and Hillel has weekly Kosher meals",comment,19

The main organization for Jewish life at U of T is Hillel. This is like the Jewish headquarters for the school. They have their own building (the Wolfond Centre) where they regularly hold community and religious events.

U of T also has a Centre for Jewish studies, offering a variety of Judaism related classes (course code CJS).

For more social groups, while not technically affiliated with the university there is a Jewish frat (AEPi) which is exclusive to U of T and there are two Toronto wide Jewish sororities which take members from U of T (Delta Pi and ZBO) .

There is a club called United Against AntiSemitism which is not exclusively Jewish but definitely has a lot of Jewish members.

Those are the main groups I can think of right now but I'm sure there are others you could find as well.

Good luck with your first year in Rotman and don't hesitate to reply/pm with any questions",comment,12

It is so dangerous to answer this anonymous poster even if his username is DavidR. This person, an incoming university student, is just one google search away from finding Hillel on instagram or even asking a Jewish canadian reddit instead. Puzzling why they would ask here. Even more sus that they have asked this a bunch of times already in their post history. Be careful who you respond to online, you never know what is someone's ulterior motives.",comment,13

If you’re a girl ZBO and Delta Pi are pretty big too. There’s also Hebrew and Jewish studies classes that tend to attract quite a few Jewish students.

You're bringing up misinformation and hateful rhetoric you've convinced yourself of because you are afraid and ashamed to admit to your victim complex. Do you think Hamas exists for no reason? That there was no catalyst to drive an oppressed population to fight back against their occupiers? Start there, and work your way backwards, if you are mentally capable of it. 

You are spitting in the face of anti-Zionist Jews who are successful, peaceful, and beloved members of all countries they inhabit around the world. Shame on you.",comment,11
