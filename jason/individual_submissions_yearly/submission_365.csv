One thing I’ve noticed about these clubs (at least the ones I’ve been part of + Daniels Faculty of architecture) is that their executive team is almost entirely comprised of female students. I’ve witnessed one occasion where the president was an older male student, but otherwise, all president positions and their exec team across different clubs have been at least 80% female.

My experiences will most likely differ from other students, especially those outside of the Daniels Faculty (our male-female ratio is much lower than other faculties). But I was genuinely curious as to why male students either refrain from leadership positions or fail to take on these roles. Or maybe another way of thinking about it is, what incentivizes or encourages female students to take interest in leadership positions more than male students?

(Also want to clarify that I’m not insinuating anything or being misogynistic, literally curious as to why this happens so often)",submission,70

There is a chance that the clubs you gravitate towards simply have more women. I have seen many CS clubs with male leadership (albeit also with mostly men members). I have also seen Student Unions with alternating male and female leadership. Granted, they represented pretty 50:50 groups.


**tl;dr:** From observation, it depends on the ratio of men v women.",comment,51

My cousin works in the government and she says this is a large trend, roughly a 60-40 split. Also I am in a predominantly male department but most of my friends don’t really get involved outside of studying. Most seem to think the system is against them and just want to get out of here.

If I were to guess, I would say it could be because guys are simply not interested in putting that much time and energy into an activity that might not necessarily have direct benefits for themselves, whereas women would pursue it regardless of what material benefit they get out of it because they simply care about the cause or activity (i.e., they don't do it so X or Y, they do it because they like to do it).",comment,41

During my time, 3 out of the 4 VUSAC Presidents were men and the VPs were pretty evenly split between genders. 

I'd say to anyone who is thinking of getting involved in student life, it's absolutely worthwhile, both from the experience itself and its payoff down the line. It was extremely fun, I made friends that I'm still close with to this day, I had the opportunity and resources to lead projects that nobody puts a 21 y/o in charge with in a real workplace, and developed skills that helped me land my first career job. 

I still run into people all the time that I knew through student life, and generally they're doing pretty cool things in their work -- unsurprisingly, people who are motivated enough to take on leadership roles in university tend to be pretty motivated people afterwards.

Having ""University of Toronto"" on your degree doesn't necessarily mean much in the real world (results may vary a little by industry). People aren't impressed by it like they are with Harvard, and you don't get the ""ooh, we're both alumni!"" effect because the school is just so big. But some really smart, ambitious, cool people graduate from this school, and if you join a club, you'll probably meet some of them; if you do a good job and aren't annoying to work with, they'll likely think of you positively in the future.",comment,5

But outside U of T there's some data showing women are more likely to do administrative or organizational work in many fields. So it might partly be that day-to-day admin roles in student clubs like booking rooms or arranging snacks are more normalized for women than for men, or that men might feel more free to just show up and participate without doing those roles. Women might also feel the need to stack up more of a resume before entering the work field, since they expect to have to prove themselves more.",comment,5

Men may start below women but over 30 years in a career they get promoted to leadership positions more easily. They don't have to over do it.

It's not that there are ""more"", I think it just seems that way because women are now getting the right influence to take on challenges that previously were seen as a male dominated field. Men have not really had to deal with that type of inequality so they would be less likely to be as empowered. tl;dr it's just the playing field finally leveling out and things becoming more equal.. not done yet but getting there. I would suspect that this would be the same for any group that has been marginalized in the past.

So, peep this: in student orgs, you've noticed a trend where the exec teams are mostly female, right? Well, it could be that women are feeling more empowered to step up thanks to the rise of female leaders in society. Plus, social norms might be pushing them towards those nurturing, collaborative roles.

Meanwhile, dudes might be feeling the pressure to be more stoic and competitive, which could be holding them back from chasing those leadership spots.

But hey, this ain't about pointing fingers. It's about understanding and creating a more inclusive vibe. So let's keep the convo going and encourage everyone to shine in whatever role they feel best in.

It's the same with entrance scholarships. Even though females have dominated universities since the 80's and the disparity favouring females is above when all these programs were put in place due to males being higher enrolled there are still more programs for females than males.
