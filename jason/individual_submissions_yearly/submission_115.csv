He will offer for you to take a pic of his ID but im pretty sure its fake. Dude stinks like ScheiÃŸe, havent showered in years, and his mandarin is barely understandable. Doesnt speak a lick of English. idk if he's speaking hakka or canto or smt. 30-60 years old i really cant tell. Don't fall for it guys. I talked to him bc i thought he was somebody's parent touring the school who got lost",submission,199

University students have been the targets for many scams, especially international students. The vulnerability of being in a new environment and new people speaking in different languages can disorient people and make them a lot more gullible to things. All I can say is please be safe out there and use your judgement before trusting someone like this.",comment,13
