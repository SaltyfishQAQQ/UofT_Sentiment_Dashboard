Classes donâ€™t actually start on sharp. They start 10 after. Once you start walking, youâ€™ll realize that campus isnâ€™t that big in particular, especially with Eng since Eng usually holds classes in a specific set of buildings. 10 minutes is more than enough to comfortably walk between all your classes and make it on time before the prof starts talking.",comment,1
