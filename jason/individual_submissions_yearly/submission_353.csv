Is it bad if I make a move on a guy my friend obviously likes but refuses to admit it?,deleted,1hmjkoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hmjkoa/is_it_bad_if_i_make_a_move_on_a_guy_my_friend/,1735198703.0,"For context, we have a friend group of 7, 4 girls and 3 guys. Only 3 of us are single. Now both of my single friends have obvious chemistry, and she‚Äôs confessed to me how confused she is, and its really obvious she likes him, and he reciprocates.

The thing is. I feel we have really good chemistry too and spend a lot more 1o1 time. If it wasn‚Äôt for my friend, we would have started dating. 

She kinda has dibs on him, but also refuses to make a move, am I an asshole for going behind her back and sleeping with him after spending the whole semester convincing her to just ask him out?? 

She found out and she‚Äôs turned the whole friend group against me and I feel so ostracized and alone.",submission,74

You're both in equal standing when it comes to approaching him. If she hasn't made a move then it's her issue, and if he agreed to sleep with you then it's his choice. 

But in hindsight, it's more about courtesy from transparency. If I were in your shoes, I'd at least disclose it to her for her sake before taking the move because I care about her. It appears that you don't. 

TL; DR: the issue isn't you sleeping with him, it's you not disclosing to your friend.",comment,79

Sounds like the girl somehow convinced everyone including the guy (probably more of an echo chamber/group 'consensus', where others chimed in with their 'observations' and half-baked opinions behind your back, stoking the self-righteous (and stupid) flames further) that you are the person to blame.

It's upsetting just imagining what words were thrown around (especially behind your back) as the fiasco was brewing. It's equally upsetting to think that nobody stuck their neck out for you and asked the most obvious yet sobering question: ""Why shouldn't they be mad at him as well if this was true?""

At this point, the situation seems completely cooked. 

Dumbass #1 thought her chemistry is a good excuse for her inability to communicate her feelings, and thinks she has the right to get mad when her 'plan' inevitably fails.

Dumbass #2 is not able to take (or even understand) responsibility for his own decisions if he is not the one being accused.

And the rest (maybe not all of them but ig u won't know) are dumbasses for issuing premature opinions to Dumbass #1 based on hearing only one side of the situation especially if you were still part of the friend group at that point.

I guess the best option is to move on and find more emotionally mature friends. (and don't bust a nut with a fucking dumbass LMFAO)",comment,1
