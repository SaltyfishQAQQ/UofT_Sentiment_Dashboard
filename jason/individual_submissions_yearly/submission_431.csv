Why is fall semester soooo difficult in first year? ,Kindly-Hedgehog5536,1gizk72,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gizk72/why_is_fall_semester_soooo_difficult_in_first_year/,1730674069.0,"Idk if it’s just me but first year is actually horrible. I study a lot but I still end up failing my exams or barely passing.

I feel depressed knowing that I was once a good student but now I feel completely stupid cuz of my grades. I really don’t know what happened. I knew life sci would be hard but I wasn’t expecting this. I always work hard and study, and it usually pays off…but not this time. I don’t know where I’m going wrong. 

I honestly feel so lost I really don’t know what to do with my academic career at this point 😭. I feel like I’m in an academic slump where I try to catch up but I just can’t. I keep wondering if I would have been better off attending a different university. This fall semester has actually taken a toll on my mental health. 

Does it get better ?

I was not happy with the program I was interested in. I failed a course in my first year due to not studying because I did not know how to study. I am in my second year now and I'm studying way better and actually know how to study. My advice is to evaluate what you want to do better in the future. Do you like your program? Are you developing new study skills? It won't get easier at this university but it will get easier if you learn how to study better for exams and midterms. There are resources on campus such as the AA&C they have wonderful tips and resources that can truly help.",comment,2

First year is known to be challenging for students, because as others have pointed out, it's a transition period. University load is different, and you're transitioning into adult life where there are other responsibilities (depending on if you live away from parents or not). 

Regarding studying, it requires a different approach from high school, not matter how tip-top shape your study habits and grades were in high school. For example, I learned the hard way that you can't physically do all the readings and assigned questions (obviously do the ones that are worth marks). It's a process of identifying and learning which parts you actually need to spend time on understanding and consolidating, and which bits are fluff. For example, I did actually do all the assigned questions for CHM because I knew I needed the practice, and it did pay off. I remember spending significantly more time on certain courses like organic chemistry. Also, most readings, especially for papers, it's just a quick skim for first year understanding. It might be a good idea to reach out to your college's academic success for support as well. For studying concepts like biological processes, active recall is key. Strive to be able to teach it.

For assignments, it's very much worth the time to communicate with the TA/prof that is grading your work to ensure you have a clear understanding of the expectations. Don't be afraid to check in with them, ask to chat, just to see if you're going the right route. The writing centres are also a great resource. 

I don't think I've met a single U of T student who hasn't questioned their decision to come here at some point. I've heard of people leaving after a semester, dropping a course, switching streams - these are all options, and may depend on your financial and domestic/international status. I have to admit, at least in my experience, I've compared my first year life sci workload with Western and MacMaster life/health sci high school classmates, and their load seemed to be a bit lighter (I may be biassed in the ""grass is greener on the other side"" way). 

As for whether it gets better, I think it does once you develop your own strategies for tackling different types of courses/assignments/assessments, and also build your social supports at uni. I don't think the content itself gets any easier, but you grow and get better at drinking from the firehose. As others have pointed out, the courses become more specialized, so that may come with greater interest in the course content, which can make it feel easier as well. 

Just some quick questions for yourself, especially if you're the overachiever type who's trying to do everything: Did I sleep (\*coffee doesn't replace sleep\*)? Did I eat (an actual meal)? Did I shower today? Did I see the sun/outdoors or talk with anyone recently? 

For many incoming U of T students, we come in having had a history of academic excellence, and it can be shocking when we fail, because it's a shock to our identity. As cliche as it sounds, we are multifacted and there is more to our identity. You are more than a good student; you are perhaps a good friend, good sibling, a good son/daughter/child, a good pizza maker, a good sheep whisper, heck who knows! The challenges of this semester present you an opportunity to reflect and grow - might not be what you want to hear, but this may ring true later :) 

This was a longer post than expected, but I truly wish you best of luck moving forward. The end of first semester is in sight!",comment,2

High school doesn't adequately prepare you for the fast pace and heavier workload that uni entails. It'll take some time to adapt and that's completely normal.

Additionally, third- and fourth-year students typically have more flexibility in course selection, allowing them to tailor their studies to their interests. By this stage, students are generally more familiar with the university environment and have developed effective study strategies, which can make academic life  more manageable then the first year",comment,1
