Most students just stay late into the night (1-3AM) to study if they are night owls. I prefer all-nighter tho and I'm gonna attempt to do it tn for the first time since like April. I'm just excited that I don't have to leave at 11pm and can actually study when I hit my peak study time/energy.,comment,7

So I will finish by Wednesday morning, shower and stuff then go to class from 1-9 and sleep till Thursday morning so like get 12 hrs of sleep that night to make up for it. Usually tho I would just stay here till 2-3am tho",comment,2
