I assumed he was 23 or something. He is a very smart person to be honest and I remember once he aced his physics midterm ( like 100) and he was very happy about it.

Heâ€™s pretty cool and not as stereotypically nerdy as you might think, he likes physics/math obviously but you can still talk to him about nearly anything. Slightly awkward since heâ€™s still a teen but overall nice guy, heâ€™s very humble and relaxed. When talking to him, you just feel like youâ€™re talking to another peer, not some super genius.",comment,68

For the first few months I knew him I thought he was just a little short but then I learnt more about him. Iirc he has written two papers on quantum computing/information, one of which has been cited by nature. 

Aside from being really smart he is a very talkative person and can strike up a convo with anyone (this seems impossible for an introvert like me)

He's also active on this sub. Very likely he sees this post.",comment,182
