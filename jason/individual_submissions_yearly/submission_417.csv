Anyone ever notice a strange woman in black in  woodsworth college?,SwiggityDiggity8,1g8duct,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g8duct/anyone_ever_notice_a_strange_woman_in_black_in/,1729472254.0,"Was at one of the classroom reviewing today on the first floor in the older section of woodsworth (the part without the dorms on top), and noticed a middle aged black lady dressed in full dark black including headscarf and pitch black sunglasses sitting in the hallway looking forwards. Wasn’t too weird at first, but went to the washroom a couple times and she was just sitting like that for hours, no phone or nothing, vibe felt really off too.

Told the friend I was with in the classroom, we laughed it off. About 3 hours later decided to leave, and as soon as we open the door she was just standing there staring at us from the left (far from where she was sitting, about a metre from our faces) imagine going around a blind corner. Looked at her for a second, vibe completely off at this point, completely expressionless, and we left.

Idk could be some random blind lady lol but wanted to know if anyone else encountered ",submission,58

I have no idea who she is. One time I was early for class so I went in to put my stuff down and she was sitting in the darkened room. She left when I came in.",comment,34

I assume she stays at a shelter at night (probably Sisterings which is further west on Bloor) and needs somewhere to hangout during the day.,comment,20

You'll want to call campus security next time whether she's inside or hanging around outside. I've heard stories where she's lost it where she becomes a threat to others.  It's why the weird vibe.

That would be from mental illness off her meds or deciding to do street drugs or both. Not sure if she's homeless or staying at a LOFT supportive housing building for being mentally ill and/or drug addiction. Some on welfare get subsidized housing too (TCHC).

From the stories, it seemed like too much meth when she freaks out. That drug is endemic in Toronto since it can be made at home from non-drowsy off the shelf anti-histamines from pharmacies and a few supplies from Home Depot. In some US cities, they keep the non-drowsy ones behind the counter for this reason.",comment,3

She freaked out at some students, yelling at them, throwing things.

It is however near an Out of the Cold free meal program at St. Basil's church just set back from Bay St. They offer free lunches 2x a week to the less fortunate. A few hang around before and after, some wander nearby. This year, it's on Monday and Tuesdays.

for Woodsworth, she could be coming from Church of Redeemer at Bloor and Avenue Road. They give free lunches during the week. There's some who do that are a couple blocks south of college on Spadina. Also the Sanctuary at Charles and Yonge. 

The less fortunate hang downtown because of all the free handouts, doing the circuit. Some homeless, a few housed. Most have addiction problems. 

Or she could live in TCHC housing at Bloor and St. George. Here's the [lookup](https://torontohousing.ca/about-us/our-buildings) of their buildings. TCHC = Toronto Community Housing Corp. 1/3rd of Toronto's crime happens near them.

Someone like this, the police are already aware of. I imagine campus security as well. For us, it's easy to miss them until trouble happens. Helps to take a photo for campus security. They are great with keeping the campus safe.",comment,3
