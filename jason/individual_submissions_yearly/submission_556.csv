Why are still cars allowed on campus?

It's an eyesore on campus which has become majorly pedestrianized. They also made a whole new underground parking, so why don't people who park there and then walk? Today I was being hurried by a lone car driving around the kings college. It's inconsiderate of the massive majority of people who are walking and biking around the area and overall is kind of embarrassing to see people still driving in the area. I also feel like the rest of campus should be pedestrianized instead of creating on street parking to incentivize people to drive to campus when George st is already seeing the early onset of traffic in the midst of a pedestrian heavy campus.

Cars sometimes scare me as a mobility impaired commuter. I sometimes get worried that I can't jump out of the way should something, heaven forbid, happen. Toronto driving is so aggressive these days.

I feel like we should be arguing for more accessible public transit and kinder campus infrastructure, not necessarily car access. This suggestion is inflected by optimism and my wishes for more than 1 accessible GO train car, though, lol",comment,18

Especially if you're coming from out of the city the traffic on the Gardiner is insane and I would never subject myself to that type of suffering. All it takes is one accident or some mid day congestion and you're done for. I've been working and studying at Uoft for years and I've found efficient ways of getting to school without taking my car into the city ever. I also don't think is cost effective or faster than taking the GO train, which I am a regular customer of and personally I have yet to experience any sort of major delay.

I don't take an entirely car free route. I am a commuter myself. I drive to nearest GO station and then take the train. Who are you talking about commuting 4-5 hours. There are so many GO bus and train routes all across the greater Golden Horseshoe, including inter-city and town transit, which I'm sure taking a route with some type of transit on the way to city makes the commute a lot shorter. I now people who commute from Milton, Barrie, Whitby, Oshawa, Oakville using GO routes, and they've also explained this is to avoid the hell traffic and inconvenience of getting stuck in the 401 and 42 traffic, which by the way is getting so bad now days because people are choosing to ignore public transit options. I also know people who drive to the city just for the sake of driving and then also complain about traffic etc. If more people focused on transit/cared about transit maybe the provincial government would focus on make it more accessible, frequent, faster instead of making new highways like the 413 that will eventually clog up just like the others.",comment,0
