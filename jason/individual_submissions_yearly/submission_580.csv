2. With current job market, you are basically fucked without a degree. I say this because I do interviews often, and for the past year, 100% of candidates have a degree, many masters/PhD too. Not the case 3 years prior.

I would suggest not dropping out, if you are not an international student, the tuition is not that outrageous.",comment,41

(Context I‚Äôve always been poor/ grew up poor and still am poor, so this isn‚Äôt because my parents can pay or anything like that) 

I wouldn‚Äôt trade my degree for anything. I for the first time in my whole life get to study the one thing that I always always kept coming back to me as a career choice throughout my childhood.  My field is fickle and horrible in terms of jobs regardless of how the economy is doing. I chose this degree because I can do this job for the rest of my life, not retire and still be very happy with my life outcome. 

My degree was a choice of passion not a choice of how much money I would make, therefore I‚Äôd still start the degree knowing I wouldn‚Äôt get a ‚Äúproper job‚Äù straight out of university. In my field this is why you have higher education, to gain more of those $$$. (Additional context: in my area you don‚Äôt always have to pay for masters/PHD but this can be very variable depending on the country the program is apart of). Continuing in higher education in my case shouldn‚Äôt  cost extra because of the type of study I want to do. 

My Philosophy is I would rather have enough money to live/take care of what I need and do what I love, than choose a degree/career that would make me neck myself in less than 10 years like finance.",comment,10

I did a double major, and I chose one of those majors *specifically* because of the job prospects/earning potential. The other I chose out of interest.

When I graduated (over 10 years ago üò≠ I'm old), I worked in the more profitable field for a few years... and I hated it. I ended up quitting and taking a massive pay cut to work retail instead, and was way happier.

When I decided I wanted to go back to grad school, I basically only looked at programs that were relevant to my passion degree.

So yes, if I were in undergrad now, I would 100% complete my passion degree even if I knew I wouldn't get a job after. I don't *regret* doing the other major, because it's still relevant to my research interests and taught me some practical skills that I value, but I would have been deeply unhappy if I had *only* done the job-prospect major and not the passion major. And it wouldn't even have been worth it, because I hated the industry and left after only a couple years!",comment,2
