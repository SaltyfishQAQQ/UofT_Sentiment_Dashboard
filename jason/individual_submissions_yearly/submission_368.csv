That this guy came, organized a rally, then left, is exactly the kind of protest that’s allowed…that anyone from O4P would say that makes them not feel safe is so un-self-aware it is absurd. Also, worth noting, Columbia university as an institution decided that anti-Zionism, as it was being expressed by pro-Palestinian protesters, was, indeed, anti-Semitic.

Edit: here’s their report, for those who are interested…[https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf](https://president.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/content/Announcements/Report-2-Task-Force-on-Antisemitism.pdf)",comment,34
