Open access to research journals/interlibrary loan is a really good way to make your money back in knowledge.

Even ‘mundane’ things like muscle building or potato growing methods have research articles. Once you graduate, you lose access to all of this and it will cost around $50 per article.

Unfortunately, most undergrads don’t take advantage of this, and all their tuition money and four years is spent on a piece of paper (degree) used for an entry position in their career.

EDIT:

Here are resources I have personally found useful with a student utorid:

[Free $100 cloud credit renewable yearly](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-ca/free/students) (Use your utoronto mail to sign in. I've used this to host a Minecraft server with friends, as with other things to tinker around with. Don't use this for business purposes, it is purely for educational purposes only.)

[Free GO Transit student discount](https://www.gotransit.com/en/student-savings/post-secondary-discount) (Full-time status, yearly renewal and PRESTO card required. 40% discount on your PRESTO card. I simply hopped on the train to view the eclipse in Hamilton, as well as Niagara Falls for around $12. Better than any stressful drive.)

[Free Student Identity Card for International Travel](https://ca-online.aliveplatform.com/ordering/card-type-selection) (Full-time students, use this for student discounts when travelling abroad. I believe yearly renewal is required.)

The best for the last:

[University of Toronto Libraries](https://onesearch.library.utoronto.ca/)

Everyone needs to take full advantage of this resource. Original law documents, drug monographs, religious/historical text, cultural works can all be accessed through this for free. If a physical copy is in London for example, you can get a scan manually and personally sent to your email for FREE through Interlibrary loan.

If you want to learn/research about ANYTHING starting at ANY knowledge level, a librarian (with academic faculty status) should be able to help you find what you need, that's their job. 

The more undergraduates use this, the more the University will pay attention and dedicate to this resource. Our tuition money should go towards this.",comment,23

Also tutoring/academic help programs (ie GEARs for engineering students). 

Fabrication facilities (like the one in Myhal) as well as drop-in labs. These things are nice because you can learn and build things for essentially free. Again predominantly good for engineering students. 

These are just a couple I’ve heard about. I’ve used the fabrication facilities and labs the most, saved me like $600 out of pocket so far. 

There’s probably a lot more, I just haven’t had the chance to fully leverage them.",comment,8

Watching a video lecture is no substitute at all for going to class, asking good questions, and talking things over with your classmates after.

Sign up for organizations that match your interests or career aspirations. Go to in-person events enough that the faculty and staff in your program know who you are. Turn up. The people who meet as a student are often more important than what you learn.",comment,3
