I just loved 1d so intensely and aggressively for so much of my childhood and I can't compute that 1/5 of it is just gone forever...Even if you weren't a huge fan of 1d, they were probably a big part of pop culture for other people on campus while growing up and...idk...31 is just so young...ive got 31 year olds in my classes...

Anyways I've been crying all night and I'll probably cry today around robarts so if anyone is interested in a communal cry sesh just lmk lol

rest easy Liam 🕊️❤️",submission,35
