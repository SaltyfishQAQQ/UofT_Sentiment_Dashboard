CSC110 and CSC111 are both pretty easy and it shouldn't be hard to get the required marks. 

I recommend looking into first-year seminar courses for breadth requirements, as they usually have fun topics and are a good way to meet people. ENG102 is also a really fun bird course, as you get to study stuff like Star Wars and Futurama.",comment,17

But very recently, theyâ€™ve adjusted the requirements so that in stream students have guaranteed admission with marks in the high 70s. Doesnâ€™t mean it will be easy. This definitely still requires hard work for most people, but at least the only enemy is yourself and life lol.",comment,5

Yes, first year will be difficult because you will quickly realize how different it is from high school. You will try to integrate into a new structure and a demanding course load. So I suggest that you look into how you can organize your workload and stick to your schedule before the school year starts. Try to procrastinate as little as possible, because if they pile up, it will be demonic. 

Make sure you have time to relax and socialize, but also make sure you study more than you socialize. Many of my students had difficulty in their first year because a new life with no parental restrictions opened up new social doors for them. While that is wonderful, it is also easier that way to lose focus. So set your priorities well.",comment,5

Only be worried about MAT137 and CSC111 final. Don't be complacent or get carried away by the ease of CSC110.
