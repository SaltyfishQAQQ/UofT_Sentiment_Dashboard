That's exactly right. People complaining are just mad that they didn't get the satisfaction of seeing the students get violently beat up and thrown out like they ""thought they should."" Which was exactly the point- the students left because they didn't want to give them the satisfaction. They left with their dignity intact.

Also, how hypocritical it is to be complaining the students are ""disturbing the peace"" but still be mad when they decided to peacefully pack up their stuff and walk away. Anyone who's mad can sit and spin lol.",comment,41
