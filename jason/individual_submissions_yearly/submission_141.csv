As part of our commitment to safeguard online data, the University of Toronto recently conducted a system-wide review to ensure all email accounts meet eligibility criteria outlined in the Guideline: Email Accounts for University of Toronto Staff, Faculty and Librarians (https://uoft.me/emailguideline).

The review has shown this email account, first\[dot\]last\[at\]utoronto\[dot\]ca, does not qualify for continued email service from the university. As a result, it will be permanently deactivated by Wednesday, October 30, 2024, after which access will no longer be available.

Before your account’s deactivation date, we strongly recommend that you take the following steps:

1. **Prepare for account closure**: Follow the instructions in our Account Closure Preparation page (https://uoft.me/accountclosureprep) on how to retrieve any essential data, including emails, attachments, and contacts before the account shutdown.
2. **Update your contacts**: Reach out to your contacts and inform them of your alternate address to avoid any missed correspondence.

To learn more about this organization-wide effort to safeguard online data and manage resources more effectively, please visit our project web page (https://uoft.me/emailserviceupdate).

If you believe you have received this deactivation notice in error, please visit our project web page where you can submit a U of T status verification form or open a ticket. Our support team will verify your account eligibility and guide you through the next steps.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this notification, please feel free to reach out to the dedicated support team at: [uoft365.project@utoronto.ca](mailto:uoft365.project@utoronto.ca)
