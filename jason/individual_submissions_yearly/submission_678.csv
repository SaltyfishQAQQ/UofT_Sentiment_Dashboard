"Its been 9 years since highschool, how do I improve my grades for university",CantbeatES1,1cxilb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cxilb3/its_been_9_years_since_highschool_how_do_i/,1716325012.0,"Hello. 

I am really lost on this topic but I figured the first thing I should try is ask people who may be already in. 

I want to enroll in uoft with an end goal of reaching medical school in psychiatry. I truly is my passion and something I believe would be my best fit in the world. But I was an idiot, about 9 - 11 years ago. I can't really make a time machine or anything so did I doom my life or is there a way to make my bad past look not so bad now.

I'm also not sure how bad it really is. I wasn't a straight-A student and none of my classes back then were even remotely related to the sciences. If there was a way I could redo or start taking classes. I'm just looking for the first step.",submission,28

if you have a low-mid 80 average, you can just apply into the humanities stream and declare a life sciences major when you finish first year; streams don't dictate exactly what you'll study, it just gives you priority enrolment to certain classes",comment,14

I did complete a BA when I was 18-22 but didn't do well enough to go to grad school and only did art/history in highschool. 

Decided about 5 years ago to go back to school for science and started taking highschool science courses. Then COVID hit. Went back to adult high school to try again last year and I am now accepted into U of T Life Sciences for 2024 September. 

My average is no where what others seem to have, my English mark from grade 12 was 83. I had to take grade 11 bio, Chem, physics, and math, and then do grade 12 bio, Chem, physics, calc and advanced functions. But it was so worth it and I'm starting a new chapter soon! 

Long story short, it is 100% possible and the time will pass anyway. I'm going to be turning 30 before I start U of T but I'm so excited. 

Message me if you want to chat at all! You got this!!!",comment,7

Redid grade 12 marks upgraded. Ended up going to a different university, got the marks and am now accepted to grad school. So yes, it IS POSSIBLE",comment,2

I know TMU has some basic undergraduate night classes you can take that are transferable to a degree. Start there and then work towards a degree bit by bit. If your goal is to do med school and psychiatry you shouldn't care about having to start at uoft since a 4.0 GPA is the same at any school.,comment,-4
