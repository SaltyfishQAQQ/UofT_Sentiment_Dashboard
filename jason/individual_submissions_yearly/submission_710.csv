Did you maintain the average? If not, that’s likely the reason.

Edit: I see below that your English grade fell below the required average. It’ll be hard to appeal this, but it’s worth trying. They are pretty strict with the English requirement, and hopefully it turns out but do start to make backup plans. Unfortunately, it’s a long weekend so you will need to wait to talk to someone. Sorry your long weekend is a bit of a bust, but I hope you surround yourself with d yourself with your support network.",comment,19

Then your offer was conditional, not a final offer. 

For example they still need to make sure you graduate high school before going to uni. And if you don’t the offer is pulled.",comment,6

I suggest you to go to vln and take their English asap(it is faster) or you have any other preferences. And email them for if they can give you an extension of the grades. It is usually easier to apply for an extension than to tell to accept you in under the conditions. The only thing you can do now is to cross your fingers and wish them make it easy on you….
