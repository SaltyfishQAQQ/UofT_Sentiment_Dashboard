The grading system is just so complicated and the instructors didn't explain it well in the text. From what I've learned so far, Mathmatize is for graded hw with independent due dates that are NOT shown on Quercus, Piazza is for discussion (or maybe it's Ed for 135?), WileyPlus for exercise books, and Gradescope for submitting future graded problem sets. There are also badges we can earn by submitting evidence somewhere which are worth like 8% (?) if you get them all. For each week there are also essential pre-class videos & pre-class readings you need to do that count towards your grade. 

P.S. I'm also in Bernardo's class and it really amazes me how we spent a whole lecture solving two introductory-level exponential questions that are probably way too easy for the actual exams.",comment,12

I strongly recommend using a spreadsheet to keep track of your assignments. It sounds like your MAT135 syllabus is a mess, but it *should* have a mark breakdown that includes everything that's worth marks, otherwise something is seriously wrong. In the worst case maybe you can send me a copy and I can take a look? I can send you a spreadsheet template if you want.",comment,2
