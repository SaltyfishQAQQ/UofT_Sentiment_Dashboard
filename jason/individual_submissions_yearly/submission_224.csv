This response is in sharp contrast with how law enforcement authorities have mistreated Indigenous and racialized protesters in the past.""",comment,19

I dont see what your point is other than liking one protest and not the other. 

The school actually has legal precedent and rights to evict anyone from its property. 
in contrast the government used the emergency act, which has only been used ONCE in history (2022) and can only be used under extraordinary circumstances; for context, its predecessor, the war measure act, has been used 3 times, WW1, WW2, and the october crisis under pierre trudeau (some irony huh), Where quebecois militias kidnapped and killed a quebec MP following a bombing the previous year and trudeau responded by martial law and marching troops into montreal. Emergency act was literally enacted as a response to the october crisis since pierre didnt think that the war measure act gave enough power to the government in a ""crisis"". 
You cant honestly believe that the freedom convoy was as bad, or worse than the world wars or the october crisis do you?

Distasteful political opinions are not the same thing as harassment, and Isreal supporters have never once been removed by force for celebrating the IDF's attack on Gaza (which is an equally distasteful opinion to celebrating October 7th).. 

Also I haven't seen much evidence that people at these encampments are actually celebrating October 7th, apart from a few cherry-picked examples. You need more than a few individuals with bad signs to condemn a whole protest movement.

Blocking a single lawn is not the same thing as paralyzing a whole city. And the Convoy did a lot more than even that. They actively harassed everyone around them. By that I don't meant that they had signs with bad opinions on them. I mean that they chased down, shouted at, and intimidated people living and working in downtown Ottawa. They drove to nearby schools to harass the kids there. They launched fireworks from downtown streets so that they exploded feet from people's apartment windows. Decibelmeters measured volumes inside people's bedrooms at the same level as the sound made by a gas lawnmower, due to all the truck horns. Imagine trying to sleep in those conditions. Civil liberties do not include the right to do those things. Whereas they do include the right to protest on a university lawn.

I don't think it ever should have gotten as far as invoking the emergencies act. The local police should have cleaned it up on the first day.

You are assuming he doesn't already know. There are at least two other major issues:

1 - University collaborations and partnerships happen globally. A list of public partnerships in just one area: https://internationalprograms.utoronto.ca/partners/ - you have MENA region, China, Russia, and others on that list. The protesters seem to be only caring for the Israeli relationships and not any other country with human rights related issues. 

2 - Not everything is black or white. Investments in Israeli defensive industry has life saving defensive purposes along with the offensive issues people are complaining about. A prime example of defensive technologies from Israeli is the Iron Dome which has saved numerous lives and prevented Israeli from becoming a rocket torn hellscape. A blanket ban/removal could end up leading to a situation where you are stripping research dollars/support from life saving technologies. A non-blanket band would lead to people being pissed off that money is still flowing. This issue itself, specifically requires a veto to exist. 

> meaning that if/when he chooses not to meet any of there demands they have no recourse.

They have no recourse now. UofT can get the protesters removed already. The UofT deal therefore has a stipulation that they acknowledge that UofT has the right to exercise its rights that it already has. The issue might come into play if there is a question of criminality in the future. They signed the deal and continued (or restarted), and it was then deemed there was potentially something criminal about the encampments, they would have a hard time arguing they didn't know it was criminal (ex: demonstrating that there was not criminal intent).",comment,0

Let me clarify. King’s College Circle, and most places people tend to protest on campuses, are public grounds. This is land owned by the government that is zoned for public use and access, like a public park. 

> The entire crux of the argument around the charter of freedom of assembly is that it's not covered when trespassing on private property is involved. 

This isn’t exactly accurate. The Charter is invoked when dealings with the government are involved. Charter rights (to life, due process of law, etc.) still apply even if you are being arrested on private property. 

With public spaces, however, there is no competing interest of private use. You can generally kick protester out of your office, if you have a legitimate right to use that space. But if they are on public property, there is no real valid competing interest.",comment,1
