And ive never seen people on reddit doing this. it's just UNFAIR and ridiculous. (dont attack me

  
PS i want APM236 if anyones willing to drop itüò≠",submission,175

How could they guarantee you would be next, like if you were 3rd, the person in first would get the spot and you'd be out a couple hundo. On top of this priority waitlisted and restrictions mean this person would literally need to be enrolled in that program at that level unless it was an elective. 

The reason it isn't happening here, is because it's most likely a scam.

You should report it to the registrar.",comment,26

It makes it seem that the original poster thinks that non-asian students are criminals?  If you see people doing something that you don't like or that you think is unfair, then by all means pass the messages/links/emails/whatever onto your registrar or faculty.  Also, I'm not sure how this would work, you'd be lucky to pick up the course after someone else drops it, even if they do it right in front of you.  I could see someone paying money for this and getting absolutely nothing out of it.  I would think that it would be some sort of a scam, myself.",comment,1
