What is your routine on a typical day at UofT (can also add exam month routine),SnooPets1386,1cu35nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cu35nl/what_is_your_routine_on_a_typical_day_at_uoft_can/,1715946524.0,"for context:

I did really well in highschool and got a really good scholarship at UofT but honestly, I had a poor work ethic in highschool, no routine and would get by easy because I found that I grasped and remembered information very well.  Coming into UofT i had a massive ego especially with everyone telling me that since I did IB, first year would be a breeze. 

Well I was HEAVILY humbled. I failed a course (CR/NCR) and did exceedingly bad in the other courses first semester. Second semester i pulled myself up and tried again and did somehow better although I was very mentally drained. I have preexisting mental conditions and doing so bad only excerbated them. I have never felt like more of a failure than I did at that moment (and tbh even now). 

2nd year i again ahd high expectations. But i also took some notorious life sci courses (BCH210, BIO260, CHM247) because i needed them for my PoST. I did well in BCH210 and BIO260 (now well is subjective but I didnt do as horrible as I thought i would). Second year 1st semsester was good for me until around winter break when i started getting sick out of nowhere. I kept getting viral infections and mentally I was also not doing too well. So what was supposed to be a better second semester, turned into a HUGE slump. I could barely make it through the day but i still forced myself to attend classes and do my work because I knew the consequences laying ahead had I given in to the slump. Overall, i didnt finish second semester as strong as i wanted but it was alright. 

Coming to my point, I really do struggle with routine. While I have addressed my mental issues, turns out my previous physician had assigned a very low dosage that wasnt doing anything, I want to address the part that has to do with my own habits. I want to know what you guys do (yall that have 3.5+ GPA'S) what time do you wake up? what do you do between classes? how do you divide studying? how do you space out your repetitions with each subject? what does your weekend look like? 

I have resorted to imitation because i also have executive dysfuntion and inability to pick a starting point if something looks overwhelming. Hopefully if i find a good establish routine, i can copy it until it sticks. I know i'm not dumb so its literally just the act of me not being able to establish good routine and work ethic. I can easily adapt to any learning method so feel free to be as bizzare as you'd like. I have also spoken to multiple academic advisors in my college and learning strategists. I dont ened a tutor i just need routine. Thanks for reading if you got this far. It means a lot!!!",submission,26
What is your routine on a typical day at UofT (can also add exam month routine),moth-bee,l4h2xyq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cu35nl/what_is_your_routine_on_a_typical_day_at_uoft_can/l4h2xyq/,1715962449.0,"I graduated last year, but I had a 4.0 and I was in life sci (though it was EEB rather than anything like pre-med or biochem) and am a PhD student now. I hope this will help, I admit I also struggle with routine and feeling like a failure sometimes, but I'm always trying my best. Also sounds like you were hit with some hard circumstances and i'm sorry to hear that. I think improvement requires a balance of pushing yourself and trying new strategies as well as self-compassion during setbacks. it's good you're trying to turn stuff around and i hope it goes well for you! 

Anyways, i would wake up around 8-9 even if I didn't have a class until later in the day. The feeling of having a whole day ahead is motivating. During the day I would split my time between coursework, studying, and going to class. To be honest I never had a really strict routine other than ""always go to class, be mostly working during day time hours, always finish assignments on time.""  So like working between 11am to 6pm, inevitably working in the evenings especially near deadlines, but i was also getting distracted a lot during the day on and off so it wasn't all work all the time lol. I would do some work on weekends but not as much, like readings and chipping away at assignments, and of course depends on the workload at that point in the semester. 

I personally would always recommend going to class even if it is recorded! It helps force me to take notes quickly and concisely, with all my concentration, and I know I can ask questions right after class if i need to; when I watch lectures asynchronously at home I'm always pausing and distracted, and it feels like more of a chore i have to get to at some point. I prefer blocking out that class time and really focusing, then it's out of the way after.
Between classes or when I had no class, I would work on assignments and do readings (i didn't do all the textbook readings, only if I needed more help on the topic, but i did do all the research paper readings). The exact division of time depends on your needs but here are a few things i've picked up along the way: it's okay to tackle whatever is easier for you first, it gets them out of the way so you can forget about them, and a ""win"" gives you motivation to deal with the harder stuff. I prefer to do small tasks during short time windows between classes rather than squeezing a little bit of work on a larger task into this window (of course you can break up a large task into smaller bits). if you study with other people, do your own studying first so that it's more of a review session. maybe this is weird and you don't need to implement it but if you're prone to staying up late to work, consider doing it days before the deadline rather than the night of. i felt that it was a little satisfying to be up late working hard but with the safety net of not being RIGHT at the deadline. This is assuming of course that you are not the type to finish things early, which would probably be better!! And finally, you've probably heard this before, set your own sub-deadlines before the real deadline but make it count. Maybe make an arrangement with some friends or classmates to review each other's assignments, forcing you to have it mostly done by that earlier deadline. Or set a goal and give yourself a reward like ""i must finish this thing by friday evening and i can take saturday off/treat myself/etc."" rather than setting aside the whole weekend to work, because even if you don't meet that goal, you have more of the weekend to catch up, and if you DO meet the goal, you get a treat and/or some time off! 

A few other tips that i think are good and am trying to implement: make time for breaks and hobbies! if you don't do it your body will do it for you. i struggle with being distracted a lot and then feeling guilty for it and trying to brute force my way through. but maybe it would be better to just accept that i need a break, or build in time for hobbies and relaxation, because an hour spent staring at the screen would be better spent taking a walk, washing dishes, doing a hobby, etc. I also think tasks stretch to fit the amount of time allotted, so if i give myself all day, i will be getting distracted until it stretches to that point. it would probably be better to set a timer and say ""i want to get x thing done in 1 hour"", giving a sense of urgency and focus, and then take a break after that. 

Anyways sorry if it was word soup but I hope it helps you! Try different things and see what sticks, maybe the opposite of what works for me will work for you! Part of getting a better work ethic and routine is learning how to learn i guess, and learning when a strategy is working or not... a lifelong task i'm also still dealing with... feel free to message if you have any other questions. good luck and skill!",comment,14

Wake up 10am, eat, gym, study, sleep. Usually do readings before bed. In the evening I’ll Watch lectures in 2x speed, then rewatch them and take notes (lengthy process but helps for info retention). For classes with no assessments between midterm and exam I literally just cram the lectures in. Write questions that you think would show up on test (or ask chat gpt) then answer them. Active recall really helps. Sleep and physical health are key to doing well",comment,19

i rarely ever skip class because i find it extremely tough to catch up when i do. sometimes i skip tutorials if i don't find them to be useful.

on usual days i wake up ~1 hr before class (8-10 am depending on the day), have breakfast, get ready, grab my lunch from the fridge, then go to campus (10 min walk). in class, i take notes with a pencil and paper, it helps me retain knowledge better.

between classes, i will find some place to sit down and work on any assignments i have. i usually will also spend around an hour having lunch and socializing. depending on how late my classes go i sometimes also have dinner on campus. i also sometimes stay pretty late (9-10pm) if i have extracurriculars that day. 

if i have dinner at home i might chill in the evening or i will work on assignments that require a bit more thinking (writing reports, etc). before going to bed i also make sure to pack my lunch for the next day. i usually aim to sleep at around 11-12 but sometimes get stuck scrolling on my phone until 1am, you know how it be. 

i also try to avoid doing homework on the weekends. usually my weekends are dedicated to clubs/extracurriculars, spending time with friends, grocery shopping, cleaning, etc. 

i know engineering courses tend to have lots of assignments and i'm not sure how it is for artsci, but for me, doing assignments is the best way for me to practice and retain knowledge. when i study for exams i usually just rewrite and condense notes from every chapter and read through some past exams to see if i know how to do the questions, and prepare my aid sheet (if it's allowed). i usually don't study until 1-2 days before an exam, the rest of my time in exam season is spent cleaning my room and catching up on errands that i have been procrastinating. 

this has worked for me, but i also have a really good memory and pick up on concepts quickly. ymmv.

edit: also, i barely use any social media (except reddit), rarely watch youtube videos, and never watch TV/movies (i don't have any streaming services). i only started playing video games again recently since i have not been in school. i get most of my ""entertainment"" from spending time with people irl. this is good for minimizing distractions and improving mental health.",comment,4

I would show up to all classes and make the best use of office hours you can. In terms of a schedule 4 to 8 hours of school work/studying a day and allocate it spread nicely throughout the week depending on what classes you have and the priority of them. Also best to maintain steady studying throughout the year so that when exams happen it’s like a smooth natural process. For exams I like to leave at least 3 or 4 days entirely to each course if I can to make me well prepared.,comment,3

I don't have a rigid routine that I follow day-to-day, and my sleeping patterns changed dramatically over time (first year I was waking up 1pm on average, this year around 10 am on average). I don't have a rigid study schedule. However, I aim to hit 3-4 hours of studying outside classes/tutorials a day on average. Ofcourse the hours will change depending on the week (midterm season might have me hitting 6+ hours a day on avg, finals upwards of 8+, but less hectic weeks can be as low as 2 hours), however it tends to average 3-4 hours by the end of the semester (including weekends). 

This might sound very hectic if you factor in the number of hours of classes I might have a week (15-20 depending on the semester), however I tend to be quite selective with the classes I actually go to. If i find that a class/tutorial is a poor use of time I would rather spend that time studying on my terms. Ofcourse, it can be quite easy to abuse this line of thought and end up missing most classes (in second year second semester I was probably only going to 5 out of the 21 hours of class I had a week), and so unless you are confident a class is an absolute waste of time, it's in your best interest to show up. 

In terms of how I spend my 3-4 hours of studying outside of class, I will work on whatever course/homework is most urgent by factoring in how close the deadline is, and how strong I am in that subject area. In particular, I always keep track of all my grades in assignments/midterms such that I know how much leeway I have with upcoming assignments/midterms. If I had been doing worse than I had hoped in a course, I'll dedicate more time, and vice versa. I also use the pomodoro method for studying. If you haven't heard of it before, it's essentially a method whereby you work for 25 minutes then take a 5 minute break for 3 cycles, and after the 4th cycle you get a 15 minute break, then rinse and repeat. It really helps to keep me going for extended periods of time without burnout. I personally do a 50-10 split, but they all essentially function the same. I use a website to track my hours, tasks, and pomodors everyday so that I can ensure I am spending enough time on each thing I wanted to work on. This way, I am better able to split my time effectively as I work on a time-focused basis rather than a task-focused one since I generally found myself grossly underestimating how long a task would take me, leading me to set unrealistic goals with what I want to get done each day. This meant that I would generally end up only doing one task for the entire day, meaning I'd have fallen behind on all my other courses while also feeling like I'd ""failed"" that day. If you find that this is something you find yourself feeling, I suggest you give the pomodoro method a try.

I also still try to make time for hobbies and activities outside of studying/classes most days. I'll tend to keep at least 1 day a week (usually one of the weekend days) where I can try and reset myself and spend a relatively minimal amount of time studying so that I don't go crazy. Ofcourse this won't always be possible if it's a particularly hectic week, in which case time management becomes all the more important so that I can make time, at least at night on the weekend, for some proper downtime. 

It's important to keep in mind that this is what has worked for me, and it is a far from perfect routine, but I hope it can at least provide some guidance to what a somewhat reasonable schedule can look like while still maintaining good grades.",comment,3

I was waking up at 4-5pm almost the entirety of the second semester. My first semester was a bit more consistent but I was still waking up at noon. I’ve tried fixing my sleep schedule multiple times but I’ve learned that I can’t function that well in the morning so I go to sleep when I feel tired and I don’t set an alarm unless I have a midterm/exam. 

I never attend class so I don’t do anything between classes. I keep up with the material by going through slides (I’m not in life sci though) and I never space out repetition for the material. I’ll go over it once the week its taught and I don’t touch it again till midterms or finals. 

I don’t think you need a good routine to do well in school (you do need a good work ethic). I have a friend who never attended class, slept at 4am and woke up around noon for the entirety of their undergrad and they graduated with a mid 90’s average.

I wake up at around 9 and workout if I feel like it (sometimes it’s one of those lazy days). Otherwise I’ll try to do some work if any. If not, I’ll just relax before my classes. Go to classes. Between classes I’ll go to the library and get some work finished. Usually at the beginning of the yr I plan out ahead of time what I’m gonna do each day of the week (readings, weekly assignments, etc.) and try to get them done before I get home (around 6). When I get home I eat, do some chores and work if I have any. Usually at 9pm I stop doing work and start relaxing (any of my hobbies). Then I go to bed around 12 and repeat.

Honestly, you don’t have to be working 24/7 to do okay. Just make sure in the time that you do spend studying that you use it really well. Just prioritize things you’re weak at. Similar schedule for exams. Don’t beat yourself up if you’re not always on track, it happens. Just make sure you get back on track. Goodluck!",comment,1

I am quite a morning person usually wake up before 8 and sometimes even at 6, and I get to sleep at around 10 (yes very healthy). My health condition doesn’t permit me to stay up late and I find it way more efficient for me to study in the morning rather than late at night. The tip of doing well in life sci is to stay on top of the materials and review them regularly, and never procrastinate so that you won’t get overwhelmed in exam season. 
I usually take a short break between classes (surfing my phone, have a coffee, etc). On the weekend I still go to the library and study, but sometimes I also hang out if I’m not that busy. 
I believe that following the routine that you’re most comfortable with is the most important. If you find waking up early makes you feel best then wake up early, if late better then late. Hope that helps:)",comment,1
