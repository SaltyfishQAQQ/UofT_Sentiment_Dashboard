ANA400: best course I have taken at UofT so far;;,Aromatic_Smoke_5633,1hbza0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hbza0v/ana400_best_course_i_have_taken_at_uoft_so_far/,1733939215.0,"ANA400 is a limited entry course and requires an application process to get in. Earlier this semester when I was deciding on weather to enroll or not, there were no helpful student testimonials about it on here. i thought i should make this post to facilitate future students decision making about the course. I never post on reddit but the experience of ANA400 makes it worthwhile for me to take the time. 

ANA400 is an anatomy dissection course in which we do actual cadaveric dissections. I have not heard of any other ontario unis that offer a course based on human dissection to undergrads so it’s safe to say that this is a rare experience. For anyone wanting to go into healthcare i highly recommend. It was an unparalleled learning opportunity. It was a 20 people class which is also rare for Uoft, especially life sci. You can be assured that your peers in the course will be some of the most academically inclined people because they look for that in the application. I made great friends in the course. It is a highly interactive course. 

The assessments consist of weekly quizzes, a peer lecture on 1 of the dissections, 2 bell-ringer exams, actual skill of dissection and participation. The course involved a 2 hour lecture on the dissection and a 3 hour dissection component in the lab every week. It takes at least a couple of extra hours to complete the dissections though. So, it’s a big time commitment. I would not recommend taking this course during a packed semester. 

Overall, the course is academically rigorous. If you are concerned about your gpa, i would look into potentially cr/ncr the course because it’s not an easy course by any means. You will have to put in time and effort but it’s possible to do well because i did. 

Dr. Ballyk is a professor like no other. probably the best prof I have come across. The depth of her knowledge is profound and she really values understanding for students. I am not sure how long she is going to continue with the course because she plans on retiring soon. But our TA was outstanding as well. 

If you can put in the work I would highly recommend taking it. Let me know if ya’ll have questions. ",submission,26
