Is sexual harassment taken seriously at this university?

I've encountered online sexual harassment with a student of this university. I googled about the Sexual Violence Prevention & Support Centre. My question is: are such matters taken seriously or do they get swept under the mat? What have your experiences been? Is there anywhere else i can complain to. ,submission,41

When I was in second year, this guy who was a friend of a friend sexually harassed me, stalked me, attempted to assault me and then he applied to my (very small) college and (very small) program as a way to intimidate me further.

I had really extensive documentation of all the things he did and the university and Sexual Violence Prevention Centre went back and forth and finally decided to do *nothing*. Their reasoning was okay, I had enough proof it happened but because there was no active peace bond or restraining order & because he wasn't a student when he was doing this stuff, none of it mattered. Even though it was ongoing at the time. 

I was begging them to just make him go to another college because I lived on residence at the time, but they said no. 

It was honestly really traumatic and lead to me taking a lot of time off school and going back to a a really bad situation at home. That guy eventually dropped out after a year, but I really didn't trust the university after that and my mental health really plummeted.

From your other replies it seems like you might not be a uoft student and I honestly dont know if they would do anything to help in that case 

If you report just make sure you have a strong support system around you",comment,20

They do take it seriously, but as other commenters have mentioned there is some pretty limited capacity in what they can actually do, but if its highly overt and breaks conduct its likely going to result in some beneficial outcome for you.",comment,3

If they had no legal obligation to do anything (peace bond/restraining order) they made it clear they would do nothing.

The university was basically like we know he's tried to assault you in the past, and we won't do anything to prevent it happening again, but if he assaults you next year on uni property let us know???

Ignoring the fact that he was doing all this to intimidate me because he knew I was really scared of him and would leave uni rather than be near him
