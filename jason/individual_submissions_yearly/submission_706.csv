I am in two other extracurricular as an exec myself as well and recently just interviewed for another one but didnâ€™t get it and now I feel absolutely terrible and like Im falling behind compared to everyone in my life. I also failed to get internships this past summer and I really really feel like my dreams/goals wont come true anymore. Ironically a family member of mine said I cant be a news anchor/reporter because of my looks. So yeah, I feel like Im not going anywhere in life and a failure compared to everyone else. Is this imposter syndrome? ",submission,26

Attending UTSG it can be so easy to compare yourself to everyone else, the only thing you might think about is all the areas youâ€™re lacking in. Let me tell you that youâ€™ve made great progress! Youâ€™re a third year student and thatâ€™s an accomplishment in and of itself. As time goes on, youâ€™ll be able to see new opportunities because youâ€™ve developed certain skills (even if you donâ€™t know it yet). Keep being persistent and everything will fall into place. Iâ€™m a 4th year student and I had all of these feelings last year, Iâ€™ve gained a lot more knowledge/experience and i like to remind myself that iâ€™m not alone. After all, iâ€™m sure many of us have high expectations of ourselves. Itâ€™s alright just keep going & keep shining.",comment,1

I feel like you guys who made it to UofT are already way ahead of the game than most of other students. So you guys even falling behind are way ahead of the curve. So stop looking at your friends to envy and think of a bigger picture.,comment,1
