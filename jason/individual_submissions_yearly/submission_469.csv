this school can't actually be as bad as people say right,deleted,1hdr0n9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hdr0n9/this_school_cant_actually_be_as_bad_as_people_say/,1734137371.0,"alright so, i'm thinking i'm probably going to go to UofT for economics through the social science faculty, maybe i'll do a dual major of public policy and economics, but I am at least applying to the social science faculty.

I can't imagine that this school is as bad as the rumours make it out to be. the st. george campus is in the middle of Toronto. there are so many people who go to this school that I don't think that you can run out of things to do or not make friends provided you make an effort. I don't think social life can be reduced to just parties, so I think I personally will be satisfied as long as it is an option on occasion 

difficulty wise i obviously can't speak to, but is it really that hard (in proportion to other schools) for a non-competitive degree? or is it just that people struggle with the transition from high school to university. i come from a school with some grade inflation but it's not crazy, so i have ok study habits although i think i def still need to improve a lot (because i am posting on reddit 

I have also heard DIRE things about the res situation, although honestly that seems to be every university in Ontario. and the costs in the city, which i'm pretty sure are doo doo. anyways thank you guys for entertaining my stupid asf questions!!!",submission,51

as for academics, it’s certainly hard, and if you’re looking for a less grueling experience then you’d be better off elsewhere. my econ coursework has definitely been challenging, more so in the sense that profs in the department are super tough graders so a 4.0 gpa would be pretty difficult to achieve but if you’re super disciplined, dedicated, and smart it’s not impossible to do really well. that being said, our faculty is killer & there’s so many research opportunities to take advantage of. i wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere else. campus being gorg is a huge bonus. also, i’m international!",comment,19

Despite hearing the stuff from people, this honestly goes for everything you do in life. Not saying you should throw other peoples’ advice in the trash, but take it with a grain of salt. Not everyone’s experiences are the same. I had a prof this year, amazing prof, who would reiterate, it’s okay to not be sure yourself rather to be sure on someone else’s experience. 

Same thing with rate my professors, the only people on there are the people who obviously didn’t do well in the course 90% of the time. A lot of people say a lot a bad things about the neuro course I just was in this semester, instead it is my best class ever in uni currently. Grade wise and my experience wise as well. I loved it. Everyone will experience things differently and that’s life. 

I heard the same shit from people 2 years ago. “The social life sucks, you’ll have no friends, it’s super hard..” Yeah, no. My social life is great, (that might just because I’m a social butterfly nonetheless) I have friends, I am doing just fine in school because I know I have to work hard🤷‍♂️. You truly don’t know what’s good for you unless you’ve experienced it yourself. I went to this school specifically for the program I’m in and the diversity of the courses, do what you want, and do it with your head held high :) Good luck.",comment,13

If they can do it, so can you. It’s more about time management, which I would say is the hardest skill to develop in university, at least in my experience. Also, create a study schedule.

I can’t speak for STEM courses after first year, but that’s just my immediate takeaway.

The workload is still hell for starter courses in social sciences (insane amounts of assigned readings), and ECO101 and ECO102 are unreasonably difficult/will be awful if you’re not already familiar with economics.

But I will say I graduated with high grades in the social sciences, and the reason for that was because I was able to take courses I wanted to in my third and fourth years — and that’s probably UofT’s strength, the range of courses it offers. 

So overall, UofT will be hard in the beginning — as with most universities — and it may even be harder. As a social science alumni, you’re just going to have to tough it out for the first two years. But I don’t regret having attended UofT in my undergrad, and I value the professors and courses I managed to take in my later years.",comment,8

If you come here thinking you’ll blink and suddenly have friends, think again. It’s a large school, with large classes. It’s not like high school where you see the same people every day and participate in class discussions and make friends (unless you take a small class course, which might not occur until minimum second year, depending on your program and electives). If you’re always in classes with 300 people, not saying a word cuz you’re anxious they’ll find you weird, and go straight home after class, yeah you won’t be friends, you’ll be lonely, and blame it on the school for not being social. You’ll have to make some first steps in initiating friendships.  You’ll college will also help with that. As for the classes, it is hard. But it’s rewarding if you’re disciplined. This school has far more opportunities than other schools, far more classes, far more departments. It’s a wonderful school.

I don't spend more than 35-40 concentrated hours on school work a week, have friends, talk to people in classes, and honestly, as a transfer student, I have never been happier.

Even with my long commute it’s been a great experience.     

Difficulty… I’ll say moderate. There are times where it’s quite easy and times where it’s very hard. So I’ll say moderate on average. One important thing is that lots of the hard parts have been because of my bad time management. Whenever I managed my time wisely and stayed on top of things, I never found anything hard. In this way, it can be as easy or hard as you make it.  

Also, you have lots of control over which courses you take. You can make your life easier by taking easy and interesting electives. Your program requirements are also flexible. You’ll often see requirements like “take 1 of these 3 classes” or “take at least 2 stats classes at the 3rd or 4th year level” etc. There are also sometimes “easier” and “harder” versions of required courses. Some people also choose to take summer courses to take less courses during the year, reducing your overall workload. These are other ways you control the difficulty of your degree.   

Social life is an interesting one, because I commute, meaning most of my social life is in my hometown. But I have made friends in each of my classes and there are lots of good people around here. So I’d say the SG social life is pretty good.    

The res situation… honestly, commute if you can. It saves you $$$ like hell and it means you don’t have to abandon your life back home. I have “two lives” now, one in the city and one back home, lol. If not, there are lots of people who still love it on residence, even if it’s not always ideal.  

The best part about going to a huge school in a huge city is that you have a huge slate of options in terms of courses, schedule building, programs, people to meet, ways to spend your free time, places to study, and many other things. So absolutely come to this school and enjoy your time here, you won’t regret it",comment,3

> there are so many people who go to this school that I don't think that you can run out of things to do or not make friends provided you make an effort

True, but you do need more effort than at other schools.

> is it really that hard (in proportion to other schools) for a non-competitive degree

The median grade for first-year econ courses is supposed to be in the high-60s, but individual students' grades are very variable. This is because they teach you formulas and general ideas, but then test you on your intuition on applying those to situations that weren't mentioned in class or in problem sets. People who have good intuition get good grades without much studying, but otherwise a lot of people study a lot and don't get good grades.

Also, why do you want to go to UofT for econ? For me, I can't see any advantage unless you want to take later-year courses that aren't offered at other universities, or want to take more advanced math courses (in Canada, only UWaterloo has a first-year MAT157 equivalent, although UW's course is only open to their math students while any Artsci student can take 157 at UofT). But some other universities also have lots of later-year econ courses.",comment,2

Yes there were a couple profs who weren’t the best, but 95% of my profs were amazing. I’ve been graduated for over a year and doing my masters now at a different uni and my profs still respond to my emails, give me advice, and are helping me with my PhD applications. Do they have high expectations? Yes usually they do but also they help you meet those. Most profs are more than happy to have multiple meetings with you and help you with what you’re struggling with. 

I lived in res first year so I made a lot of friends and found UofT great socially. But I will be honest I am in general an introvert so someone a lot more social than me might find it not social enough? But in first year I was out partying 3-4 nights a week with lots of friends. I think you just need to make an effort and not expect friends to fall in your lap without putting yourself out there. 

And there are a lot of fun things to do outside of partying, I mean you’re in downtown Toronto, if people complain about a lack of activities they’re just either uninformed or uninteresting people. I’m in the UK now and people here LOVE Toronto they think it’s so fun. I lived in Toronto my whole life and now that I’m not there I absolutely miss it! And I miss UofT.",comment,1

At Mac it was easy to get 90s but U of T profs will often say they don’t give 90s unless your assignments are PhD level and flawless… but it depends on the prof. Overall tho you get used to it and grad schools know this is a harder school and its reputation is worth it especially if you wanna go to grad school overseas like I plan to.

I am a person who likes to challenge themselves, so I if possible want to go to UofT as well as that allowing me to live in Toronto for a year (i hate suburbs), but yeah it's obviously not worth the permanent pain it would induce on my educational career. Ideally I get a feel for it in the first year and I decide whether or not it's right for me and transfer out.",comment,2

IMO grad courses are less stressful than undergrad courses. Maybe my experience is not too convincing but I indeed had a better study experience in a grad course than an undergraduate course,comment,2

I was a Waterloo undergrad, I never felt struggle there, over here, my god. But this is a grad math program...

The facilities and amenities here are top-notch, great for personal growth/exploration. You can check all the Hart House courses and clubs (these will cost money though, and I came from a career). The GCAC offers really interesting courses as well that would cost a helluva lot in corporate.

But yeah, my main gripe about this place is the difficulty. It's called University of Tears for a reason, and if you're struggling with academic work, it'll be hard to take advantage of the amenities and resources (outside the academic ones). Waterloo was more depressed, U of T is more anxious. If this will be your only degree then sure.

You also have to look at costs too, if you live in Toronto with parents, this can end up being cheaper. I used to recommend Waterloo because of the better coop program (I graduated debt free only because of coop), but it's hard to do cost-benefit these days since the cost of living has gone bonkers the past decade.

I like it here, I don't fit in well socially due to age (could be my problem), but I am impressed at the amount of resources, and connections here. This is also my terminal degree (Masters). I'm normally an A student (at other universities too), but I am starting to have fails on my transcript lol.",comment,10
