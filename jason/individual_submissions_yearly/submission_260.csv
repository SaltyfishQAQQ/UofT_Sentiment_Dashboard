Initiate and maintain conversations, be available and supportive, listen actively, demonstrate you’ve got skills and knowledge, at a time you feel is best casually suggest having a coffee or something mellow together if you want to chat about school, which can lead into getting to know each other more.

Don't build it up so much before you even talk to her.  Unless you do know a few things about her, and if you do have some things in common, then talk about that.  

Smiling, making eye contact and saying hi is a start though.

Also, maybe this is obvious, but don't stare at her body.  It's creepy.",comment,3

If you don't do this now, you are going to regret it far into the future. 

A low risk way to speak with her is to go up to her and say ""Hey, I haven't met you yet. What's your name?"". Typically, girls who like you will tell you their name and then ask you for your name. If she doesn't ask you for your name, it could mean she doesn't like you or she could just be shy.

After opening the conversation, ask her some questions to get to know her. Ask her where she's from, what she likes to do for fun, what program she's in, etc. If SHE LIKES YOU she will likely give you in-depth answers that lead to other interesting avenues for discussion. She may even ask you personal questions.

If you've asked her 3 questions, and she's given you basically one-word answers for each, it's a good sign she isn't interested in speaking with you and doesn't find you attractive. That's okay, there are plenty of fish in the sea. 

  
If she's receptive and you've been able to have a decent conversation with her for 1-3 minutes, don't beat around the bush. Just say ""Hey, X name, it was great meeting you. I think you're really cool. I'd love to take you out sometime soon to get to know you better. What nights are you free?"". 

You're going to have to risk getting rejected. Rejection is okay and it's better to know that she isn't interested rather than wonder years later what would have happened.

Hope this helps. Remember, no matter what happens, you're great and one person's opinion doesn't mean anything.",comment,3

This means, accept that it's very unlikely you'll succeed the first time, that it would probably be embarrassing - but you'll overcome it. I can't tell you how many times I got embarrassed in this kind of situation. But at the end of the day - so what? Nobody will ever think about your embarrassment to even 0.1% as much as you do. People really don't care, they have their own thoughts and embarrassments that keep them awake at night. You don't spend half an hour a day thinking about some embarrassing shit you saw someone else doing, right? Why would anyone else then be obsessed with your stuff? (and if there's such a person - they are a weirdo).


Now, practicing must be respectful of the humanity and space of the other person. Do you feel they're not interested? Stop and move on. They don't owe you anything, same us you don't owe anything to random people around you. Be respectful, don't overltly discuss sexual topics, and remember that statistically what you find fascinating (computer games? Physics? Cats?) they don't, so don't push topics on them. Just get into a conversation about normal things and see where it leads to.


Good luck.

If a girl is going to be interested in you, she’ll be interested in you regardless of how your relationship starts. The best relationships start as friendships, you want your partner to be your best friend. If you feel you’ve been friend zoned it just means that girl doesn’t see you as more than a friend and that would’ve been the case regardless of how things started with you.

There’s no indication of if you’re joking or not and this line is said so often that I wouldn’t assume it’s a joke. Like obviously it’s always said in a joking way, but the fact that it’s said at all is what’s gross. If you were being ironic or unserious it wasn’t clear to me. For all I know you’re one of them who actually says this and thinks it’s a funny line. That’s what I got on first glance. My apologies if I failed to pick up on your irony. Now where my hug at…🤮",comment,1
