Why was I only reimbursed $51 dollars out of $148 for my eye exam from UHIP?

A week later, I got back my direct billing, but only received $51 out of $148 I paid. The ""Notes"" on the claim was: W16 - Benefits Are Limited To The Reasonable And Customary Amount.

Could someone explain more about this and/or if anyone has had any similar experiences?",submission,20

Usual and Customary (also known as Reasonable and Customary, Usual and Reasonable, URC, UNC, U+C and any of the other combinations) is a measure by which a treatment is fairly priced, according to a lot of parameters such as availability, complexity, average cost, etc.

Worded differently, URC is a quantifiable measure the medical system uses to price a service, and is applicable to EVERY single procedure, treatment, imaging, visit, consult, medication, etc, with the exception of OTC (over the counter) or experimental (like when a new medication is being trialed and therefore there's no history).

Because this is quantifiable, it is also knowable. There's websites that are dedicated to providing the costs (though the overwhelming majority will have yearly cost associated to it, and where these costs can easily get to $2000 per year for access). All medical providers (whether thats a clinic, hospital, telehealth, pharmacy) as well as insurance have access to these sites in some way, and they use it to set pricing. Canada and USA work together with this, but the government needs to also step in like with the site the other person gave.

To give an arbitrary example, let's say that generic amoxicillin (an antibiotic often given for frequent and simple illnesses) is priced at $10 CAD. This can go down to $7 or $8 in Toronto because of the vast number of pharmacies, or $19 in a remote area like Timmins or a smaller town. This is before the cost of dispensing (which adds to it). The pharmacy can then look up the price and price it at $12, but the insurance can then either say ""we only cover $10 CAD or 80% of URC which is $8 CAD"" and the rest is the patient's responsibility. URC is a way to keep fairness in the system.

Now, that then becomes a problem when the pharmacy does not indicate there will be patient responsibility, when the clinic sends the prescription to a pharmacy they are in network with that charges MUCH more, but there's also a major lack of knowledge and interest across the medical industry (worldwide) where unless the patient knows, it is not the pharmacy's responsibility to disclose any of this.

The next problem is that according to the medical industry, the patient must be informed and read terms and conditions as well as local jurisdiction laws as well as etc etc etc, or if a minor or student that responsibility falls on the parents. The medical provider is there to provide services or medication, not to educate, and the insurance company is meant to cover (or not cover) services and reduce costs.

Neither providers nor insurance are legally obligated to educate patients ay all, anywhere in the world (and the moment regulation steps in to change that, the worldwide healthcare industry will be thrown into chaos). So they wont. Those who know and have an ""in"" as we call it get all the perks, those that dont will not. It's the nature of the game.

What the game should be is an entirely different question and one that people have dedicated entire PhD theses to discuss, but because of all that was said above, you then are stuck with a medical provider (eye exam in your case) who charged far beyond what they normally charge (URC for an eye exam in Toronto is around $90) and the insurance (UHIP, not OHIP) which then said they only pay a percentile fraction of the URC.

If this is disputed (and that is your legal right and prerogative) you can submit an appeal to the insurance, but they will counter with ""why didnt you do research"" or ""why did you go to an eye doctor at the busiest and biggest mall in the city"" and that this falls on you as an adult. You can then dispute this with the eye doctor office but they will come up with similar arguments, since all their costs are (and have to be) publicly available.

For context, I did my eye exam at a very high end medical provider in Yorkville and my insurance paid in full (up to $100) but that is after I asked the price upfront and told them what the insurance would cover, then negotiated and arbitrated the price down PRIOR to getting services down from $120 to $100). When I submitted it to the insurance, it included in the receipt that an amount was discounted, and knowing the URC for insurance they covered it in full. 

This context matters because not everyone will have the knowledge to do this (nor want to right there and then) and by all standards of care, $148 is on the steep side across all eye doctors in Toronto, including the higher priced ones.

It's a bit of a read but hope it clarifies a bit and helps!",comment,9

Note that OHIP doesn't generally cover general adult eye exams except for seniors and those with certain health conditions.  I'm going to guess that you're young and healthy so perhaps that's why the insurance used the $51 number for  the coverage.",comment,2

It's their job to cost contain (both in getting providers that give services at a lower cost and also to negotiate discounts or to lower paid amounts).

If I may give 1 more example, imagine you go to the eye doctor again and this time they choose to charge you $500. No insurance company will ever pay that, and they will blacklist the doctor and company so that they get reduced visits (this then eventually removes them from the playing field).

Always look at the costs prior, and dont be afraid to ask for help!",comment,3
