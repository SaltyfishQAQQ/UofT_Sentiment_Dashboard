The average student isn‚Äôt your enemy, or responsible for the genocide. The administration are the people you‚Äôre really trying to reach. Will cancelling the group‚Äôs graduation ceremony help you convey your message effectively? Or will it just give the administration an easy way to get people to hate on and discredit a very legitimate cause?


Also, something to keep in mind is what kind of first impression you‚Äôre conveying of your cause if you want allies. As harsh as it sounds, not everyone is as passionate or educated about this cause as you are. If you start by ruining a once-in-a-lifetime event for people that spent thousands of dollars on a plane ticket for, or invited their dying elderly relatives to, I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll be very willing to hear you out no matter how good your posters or slogans are. 


I do agree that this cause is worth fighting for and wish everyone involved the best of success, but effective activism is just as important as public displays.

So forcing Indigenous kids to speak English only, and passing bills to ban Indigenous tradition, displacement, are all forms of cultural genocide. 

Although the status of the killing kind of genocide (e.g. rounding up and killing everyone based on ethnicity) is disputed internationally right now by our leaders, it‚Äôs an undeniable truth that there has been a mass displacement of Palestinians, destruction of important cultural and historic sites at the moment which *should* be condemned and noted.

As a member of a university, I think it is important to go into debates with an open mind and like you said, good faith. Over 20% of Israel's population is Arabic, many of whom are Palestinian. They enjoy a higher standard of living than many of the Arabs living in adjacent countries. This fact alone disproves the genocide narrative. We can talk about the brutality of war, but genocide is being tossed around to gain sympathy points that are undeserved.",comment,1

Disruption, as I keep saying, is what gets the admin‚Äôs attention. I personally don‚Äôt think disrupting a convocation is ideal, for obvious reasons, but I also wouldn‚Äôt be upset if I were impacted by such a protest, because I‚Äôm not a fucking ghoul.

In 2015, when I was about to graduate for my first degree at UofT, there was a university-wide strike. Many classes and tutorials were cancelled, and UofT went so far as to give students free credit for courses if they missed final exams due to the ‚Äúdisruption‚Äù. I wasn‚Äôt upset then, because I supported the right of teaching staff to have better working conditions. Does this make sense to you?",comment,1

More than 50% of the population is kids, combined with the fact that Palestinians were being encouraged to have kids (IIRC, hugely dubious on this claim because it was rumours) in fear of having their people wiped out.",comment,2

I don‚Äôt want to spread disinformation so I‚Äôll keep it to what I do know, but there‚Äôve been mass displacements of Palestinians. If we call what happened to the Indigenous population of Canada and USA a genocide, I think that many factors are at play in Palestine as well which would qualify it for this. It‚Äôs settler colonialism. 

As for sympathy points, I personally don‚Äôt find myself more or less sympathetic with Palestinians based on whether or not it‚Äôs classified as a genocide: the individual atrocities are all horrific enough and there doesn‚Äôt need to be suffering Olympics.",comment,2

Obviously not being able to convocate would look pretty bad for admin. That‚Äôs literally why so many of the US campus protests are happening right now - university admins want the semester over and ‚Äúacademic continuity‚Äù so they can have the summer to buy time. The campus protests, as a reminder, have a specific goal, which is to get admins to divest from Israeli firms. I imagine a protest at UofT would be no different in its aims. You‚Äôre not considering the actual reasons these protests are happening.

Also idk why you‚Äôre going after me, a random internet dude. Getting mad at me online won‚Äôt change anything on the ground.",comment,2
