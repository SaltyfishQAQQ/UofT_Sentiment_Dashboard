I also booked a few sessions with the academic advising from my college registrar's office; they usually give me a few tips to try out and sometimes they work. I also skipped classes that did not have participation/were easy especially lectures that overlapped with courses. Also, force yourself to have a good sleep schedule (bad sleep == bar student) and try to have at least 1 social outing per week otherwise the burnout will get you. 

It will be hard but you just have to believe in yourself an be consistent.",comment,23

I used to take one less course in the Fall/ Winter and then take 2 in the Summer. It meant being in school year round, but it was significantly less stressful.

Use system thinking and critical thinking.  Go from top priority ( what's worth the most due the soonest) to low priority ( might be worth high or low but can be handed in within a grace period with no penalty to strick deadline but later than high priority) . 
Get an agenda app or make your own schedule. Use your free time productively and remember to give yourself breaks and rewards for your hard work. Do essential readings and only do supplemental ones if you don't grasp the topics with assigned readings. Always communicate with your TA and professor of any issues, tardiness or life events that might affect your performance.",comment,2

Also the time you were planning on using for social stuff, you’ll probably have to cut back on some of it. 

I had six courses in my winter semester for first year, so it’s not the exact same, but it’s not as bad as you would think at first. Also you’re gonna want to try to keep one of those six courses birdy if you can. For me, i took two seminars which reduced the tutorial amount significantly. In second year many courses don’t have tutorials, so that should help you too.",comment,1

I have mental health disabilities that can impact my day to day energy levels so I may potentially miss out on some of my lectures or tutorials if I'm too tired to physically move. I got a reduced course load accommodation but it wasn't clear to me how exactly I would go about getting that accommodation met when I talked with UC registry, so I'm taking the 6 courses this semester and if needed I'll reduce my next semester.


Some tips from my partner though are helping me stay on track. Reviewing your syllabus and jotting down the important days for your assignments, quizzes and exams in your calendar so you're never unpleasantly surprised, doing your readings and or assignments the night they're given to allow you more breathing room between school/life balance, exercising 2 times a week, eating a healthy dose of fresh fruits and veggies with your meats, and a socially fun activity at least once a week to avoid physical/mental burnout. 
Wishing you the best with your studies this Fall semester. You got this!!",comment,1
