This doesn’t include the time I spend working on actual assignments or attending class, just studying content out of my own volition. This is also pure studying, like I will sit down to work for maybe four hours but only study three of them, so it doesn’t include my breaks or anything. My friend was surprised that I only study a little over 3 hours a day and said that’s likely why I’m doing very averagely (projected 3.0 for the end of the sem with the way I’m doing rn, assuming I don’t tank my finals). I’m taking a mix of life sci and social sci classes rn as a first year (wanting to go into psych/global health dual). How much should I realistically be studying to get to that 80%, 3.7ish gpa level at some point? I feel like it’s not an unreasonable goal, it does seem plausible, I just genuinely don’t know. This is all new to me. Any advice helps! ",submission,25

Depends on ur experience, ur courses, ur ability to focus, ur tendency to ask for help, ur self-awareness to know where ur lacking, etc.

The amount of time ur studying is kind of besides the point imo.

Really what you should be asking yourself is ""how can I do better in the same amount of time or less""?

---
Important things to think about at a high level if you wanna study more efficiently but still understand stuff (which leads to good grades):

1. How well am I paying attention to what I'm studying? (if u find it hard to focus I recommend 1) exercising, 2) certain kinds of meditation, 3) not using social media too much, 4) having a good sleep schedule. If things are problematic, seeking professional help is reasonable)
2. Am I practicing course content deliberately? (i.e you should spend more effort on the things you suck at. Also doing practice problems, spaced repetition, & teaching are S-tier study methods)
3. Am I asking for help when I need it? (u can save a lot of time this way if you go to the right ppl - maybe that's TAs, profs, classmates, UofT student help resources/library, Youtube videos, etc..)
4. Do I understand feedback when I get things wrong?
5. How much background do I already have for this course?
6. What kinds of course assessments? (solo vs group projects, labs, assignments, exams, etc. - projects typically take up more time imo)
7. Am I taking breaks when I need them? (Go touch grass when u can, socialize, music, parties, clubs, volunteering, games, whatever helps keep u sane)

There's prolly more, but I think these are the high yield ones. Good luck!

*For reference, I'm in grad school (MScAC) and I typically spend 10-15hrs per course per week (2-3 courses per semester). How that's allocated per day varies wildly. Make of that what you will.",comment,12

Unless there’s a test coming up, I usually do 30-45 minutes total per day. When there’s a test that relies on practice, I do a few hours a day at most for a few days before the test. 

My advice is to use Anki for memorization and use practice problems for everything else. I’ve found that works best for me personally, but YMMV especially depending on which courses you take",comment,6

Like I skip most lectures, out of 6 I've only attended lectures for one class (it has in-class graded exercises). On average I spend maybe 1-2 hours per course, but in reality I don't study at all for weeks until an assessment is due, at which point I'll lock in and spend 24-36 hours of continuous intense study/work without breaks, sleep or any other distractions (I cancel all my plans, either skip meals or prepare them beforehand, finish all kinds of chores/errands beforehand, and am always in a dedicated study spot i.e desk at home or Robarts commons since it's open 24/7).",comment,6

People work at different speeds, people study in different manners. I’m in engineering and there’s so many different studying techniques I see people use; some spend 5+ hours studying, others start early but only spend 1-2hrs a day, others cram day before. It’s a whole spectrum. 

The only correct answer here is to reiterate your studying techniques until they are efficient and effective. In first year, I used to spend 5-6 hours per day “studying”. Fast forward to now, I only spend around 2-3 hours, and maybe hit 5-6 hours on weekends. And on top of that, my grades, well being and sleep has improved as well. 

I would say if you’re ever spending more than 5 hours a day for studying, you did not effectively allocate your time. You should also try to tweak your current studying to see what helps your retention and performance. 

For me, I’m taking 6 courses and have lectures basically 9-6PM everyday. Something that works for me is doing majority of the weeks assignments and study prep on the weekend; usually this involves working around 5-6hours each day. Then during the week, it’s mainly reviewing or doing past papers (in the case of a quiz or assessment which are weekly). This is only around 2 hours per night 7-9, then I sleep at 11. Essentially, it’s just a large burst of work over the weekend to get ahead for the week. Then the remainder is just specific studying on concepts I don’t fully understand or simply more prep. 

Also, your friend isn’t entirely incorrect in a general sense, more hours usually implies better performance. But that isn’t to say you cannot achieve the same mark allocating a fraction of the time. See what works for you!",comment,1

Idk, maybe just work on being more present in class and/or reconsider your degree? If you need to study that much, maybe you're not cut out for it?

Then again, you're only first year; this is when you're most challenged as you learn to manage the workload. Most of my friends in 1st year engineering had terrible grades, because the faculty purposefully punishes them to thin the ranks.",comment,0

You're thinking about this the wrong way. A lot of people would agree that while the content they learn in university doesn't directly apply to their current jobs, the process of learning how to learn is invaluable. Your current method is unsustainable and, frankly, dangerous. 

> Do you think if I were to schedule 2-hour naps during the bursts of study, it would help? 

You cannot ""chunk"" (for lack of a better word) your sleep because your brain undergoes multiple sleep cycles, the mechanisms of which there's still debate about, but all of which are undoubtedly critical to maintaining proper brain function. It takes about 2 hours to complete 1 sleep cycle, but when accounting for the time needed to fall asleep (especially outside of your regular sleeping patterns), it's highly probable you won't get enough REM and/or deep sleep (or, maybe you won't even reach those stages at all, since sleep cycle lengths vary between individuals). 

Think about it like this: your body has already been designed to maximize the time-to-effectiveness ratio of sleep. ""Alternative"" methods are often just shittier for your health and less efficient. 

I suggest aiming for a slightly less extreme study time; instead of 24-36 hours of continuous studying, do 12-14, then continually reduce that time until it's realistic to slot into your daily schedule.",comment,3
