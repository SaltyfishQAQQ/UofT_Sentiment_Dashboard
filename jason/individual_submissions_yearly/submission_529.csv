The answer key was released and I’m pretty sure they just added 2 to my total instead of taking away 2. I had the option to review my scantron to see my real grade, but I decided not to say anything in case nobody noticed lol. I wouldn’t be surprised if they end up catching it when they go to calculate my grade, but I’m taking the win for now.",comment,9

I’ve had this where I scored highly on a test and then the instructor decided to pull a couple of questions after many students emailed saying they were unfair / obscure etc. If you got them right (which I did) then you still got the credit, hence you would have had say 39/40 but now you have 39/38 after the prof pulled two questions.",comment,5

You would have immediately reported it if the mistake was not in your favour.
Best case scenario - it's an intentional adjustment and you will keep it.
Worst case scenario - you will have an excellent grade you've earned and be remembered for integrity.",comment,0

She said my 90-something got curved and it wasn’t an error. It’s worth inquiring about for peace of mind.,comment,3

They gave me 9.5/9 instead of 8.5/9 on one question because of a mistake (I can tell from the feedback). If they applied the adjustment and reversed the mistake, I'd theoretically get the same grade (30.5/30) but they might also cap it at 100% since then they'd notice lol. Do you think I should just be honest and tell them since it's such a small difference?",comment,-1
