I was just wondering what types of costumes would be appropriate. Will it be like a typical “Mean Girls” movie where girls have lingerie on as a costume? I have an old bunny girl senpai costume that I was going to re-wear for a party, but would that be too scandalous? Help a girl out, I don’t want to look like a freak. 😪",submission,18
