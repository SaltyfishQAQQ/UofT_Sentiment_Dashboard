My semester 1 grades are looking ROUGH and next sem it'll be better ik but I'm wondering if I should take families in canada to boost my average. I'm trying to get into social science at oft stg and socsci and humanities at uoft sc. will me taking a night school affect my chances for admission at this school? I think I can get a 95 or maybe higher, last year in APS I had a 92 so I don't think the significant grade discrepancy will be a problem?

Pls help im so scared",submission,29

I took grade 12 advanced functions in night school and it ended up being my top 6 marks and I still got in. As long as you satisfy the course perquisites and have a good top 6 marks thats what matters. Also families in Canada is not really a hard course I took it in school and it was easy especially having the prior knowledge from APS!,comment,2

I have English next semester and I had a 90 in English last year. The other courses i have are all just gr 12 versions of APS ig and I had a 92 in that last year. But I really want an average booster so I don’t have to include my adv. function mark and politics mark bc they are so horrible omds,comment,1
