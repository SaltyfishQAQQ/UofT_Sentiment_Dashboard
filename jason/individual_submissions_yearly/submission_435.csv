For many students, it‚Äôs the first time they‚Äôre having to make adult decisions.  So there‚Äôs a risk of mental health challenges generally during this life stage.  

What might make things a bit tougher at U of T is that there is no way to be successful without putting quite a bit of effort in.  Students who were able to coast on pure ability in high school can often get a rude awakening.

So there are risks in going to university generally, and particular risks with U of T.  BUT if you‚Äôre really interested in what you‚Äôre studying, and you make an effort to meet people and take advantage of campus life, it can be wonderful.  My 4 years of being an undergrad at U of T were some of the happiest years of my life.",comment,43

You can only do so much before you‚Äôre close to literally being counter productive and B.

Your average student here has far more work, needs to struggle much more to do well in their program and will be far more anonymous than other schools in Ontario. There's also the culture of the GTA more broadly, people tend to split into cultural friend groups or stick with their hs friends. it's not a very outgoing culture. 

  
However, there is also a very strong selection of student clubs here. Any hobby you have, there will be clubs that are well-funded, organized and passionate about that thing. While this is true of other schools, I think this is especially true of UofT. If you follow your passions here, you will legitimately make friends. 

  
Where UofT has a few unique disadvantages are here. 1: You and your friends will study much more. 2: You and your friends will live in tiny apartments or commute. Schools like queens, western, guelph, people all have regular houseparties, people chilling at their place playing boardgames, cooking etc because you usually live in a decent sized place close to campus. This makes those schools much better for building community. 3: shit is mad expensive here. Getting food with your boys at a sit down place will usually run you 30+ CAD. 4: honestly the school just attracts a lot of depressive, over-thinkers. These people are not fun to hang out with. 5: this place is huge. You will not see the same people anywhere near as much as other schools. 

  
Overall, my take-away is that you can definitely make friends and have a great time at UofT, but it has some unique disadvantages compared to other places in Ontario, and definitely can be a bit more challenging to socialize at compared to them. If you value socialization, and feel like you need to come out of your shell, I would strongly consider going elsewhere. If you have strong passions and hobbies, and are confident in your ability to make friends, I wouldn't worry too much.",comment,3

If you did no homework in highschool but still scored 80s and 90s, you'll need to start studying in university. It's not as easy as highschool. 

They want you to understand concepts and application. For STEM they try to put on midterms and exams questions that you have never seen before, but if you understand the concepts and know how to apply them, then you should be able to answer them. If you just memorized formulas and past exam questions, you will struggle. 

I took PSY101 for my free course and I do not recommend it. The midterm and exam were all multiple choice but they had more than one correct answer, you need to select the most correct. Midterm average was a fail, and final exam I can't remember but I'm pretty sure it was low like 50% and everyone rode the bell curve up. 

For me psy101 was harder than any of my engineering courses because it was reading and memorizing text versus STEM where it's learn a concept and apply it. My memory sucks to regurgitate information.",comment,2

Personally I lessened my course load by doing only 3-4 courses per semester and took summer courses, which 100% helped me not feel overwhelmed and burned out. In fact I know many people who took an extra year, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see, especially if you don‚Äôt know if you want to continue to academia. Some of my friends who took an extra year are more well rounded cuz of it too because they were able to get internships and jobs during their time. As for classes, my experience has been that it‚Äôs easier to score a B or B+ but much harder to score an A- or A in PSY100-200 level courses. But it‚Äôs much easier to score an A or A+ in 300 and 400 level courses.

There are also so many great resources for psych: like work study positions at research labs, Research Opportunities program (ROPs), first and second year learning communities, PURC, Psychology Students‚Äô association, so many other things too. CAMH jobs are also posted on the Work study site, check out the ROP website too because there are positions offered by OISE not many people know about that may be of interest. There are also loads of summer research opportunities at UofT like the USRA and UTEA program in Psych, SURP offered by the institute of medical science.

You can also apply to a research specialist in Psych if you‚Äôre interested (it lets you do a thesis), but it‚Äôs very competitive. You should apply in your second year cuz you‚Äôd need to take an extra year if you applied in your third year. All in all, psych is a supportive community. 

UofT also offers free counselling sessions with a therapist, once you see a doctor at the UpfT health and wellness centre.",comment,1
