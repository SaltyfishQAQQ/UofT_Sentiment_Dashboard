I'm in my final year as a humanities student (got into humanities mainly because I didn't have high school calc, and most other programs require calc). While I find my program interesting, I hate writing long-winded critical essays, and the amount of reading and writing makes me wanna drop out on a daily basis. I also find it very hard to maintain high grades in the humanities because there are no ""objective"" answers where you either know/memorized something or you don't, and it's very rare to get an A on an essay unless you're exceptionally good at critical writing. I much prefer multiple-choice, knowing the facts, case studies type of learning, and in fact I took a couple of life sci and business courses this past year and that was when I realized I really went into the wrong program. Not only was I more motivated, I literally got a 4.0 in all those courses. Whereas I have a B- average in my humanities courses on top of these courses being much more time-consuming. To make matters worse, it's very hard to break into the job market right now with only a humanities undergrad if you don't have professional connections and don't plan on remaining in academia. Obviously I'll still make the most out of my degree but I just wanted to rant. Thanks for reading",submission,106

I actually started off in life science and realized I didn’t enjoy it that much before switching to political science. Flash forward to a few years later and now I realized that I absolutely despise what I’m studying and that I picked the wrong programs twice lmao. Fortunately, I did take some economics courses and now I’m pivoting towards a career in econ/business. I plan to do an MBA after graduating as well.

What options are you thinking of after graduating? You mentioned that you’ve already taken some life sci and business courses. Is it possible for you to add a minor to your current degree and possibly pursue grad school in those fields? Post-graduate diplomas from college are also another possibility. Look into consulting, that might be a field you’re interested in",comment,46

Students are like: “how do I study this objectively?” And it’s like: “I don’t think this is the objective here.” There is a disconnect of skills and it can be punishing to people who want to do STEM to take arts classes.",comment,12

It’s definitely frustrating and can suck. Everyone’s story is different. But I know that for me, after I graduated I thought I would never go back into my psych degree. But then a few months later I saw that most people around me were not giving great psych advice and it could actually be unhelpful/damaging to people. As a more benign example, my well meaning boss was clearly not psych informed when talking about an employee that was struggling mentally. The boss gave her the advice of going off social media etc as a means of solving her problems. Whereas in my own head I was like ya no, this person was likely neglected as a child based on XX symptoms, likely grew up in an XX type of family based on her behaviours, and here are some known treatments that could actually help her move forward. Eventually I got tired of the misinformation (that people are CONVINCED is healthy), and figured I need to step in at one point. I also am very passionate about the subject. But I think it’s about finding my place in the field. Where I want to be and how I want to engage in the subject (ex. Admin at a psych ward or a full blown counsellor). 

Luckily for me, my degree is very versatile (and yours sounds like it too). So hopefully you can still use it to get into most positions; I was able to with psych.",comment,8

But all is not lost! There’s still places that your critical analysis and writing skills will be valuable. What is it about the business or eco courses that you enjoyed? Was it the topic or method of learning that appealed to you?

Some areas I would encourage you to explore that you might be interested in would be international organizations. Have you considered an internship with the UN or government? Government jobs would give you exposure to careers related to economics? Or research?

If I were you, I would focus research on organizations that align with your interests. Did you ask your classmates what type of careers they were looking into? I remember this is where many of my peers got ideas or found leads. I don’t know if a MBA would be useful without any relevant work experience. Getting real world experience will be more valuable in narrowing down your field of interest rather than more schooling. There are many areas of “business” you can get into without necessarily completing a core Finance degree.",comment,7

The job market is absolutely brutal right now, I don’t even know if I’ll be able to land some kind of entry level business/business-adjacent job after graduating this year 😩 I’ll probably just keep working at my current minimum wage job in the meantime and then apply after 2 or so years.

Wow our situations are actually so similar--I took a mix of life sci and social science courses in first year, and while I did better in the life sci ones I decided to go into social science, then I realized I disliked it and decided to switch into humanities (an even worse choice lol). I took some econ and finance courses and really enjoyed them as well, and I'm also thinking of pivoting into business/finance career-wise! I think doing an MBA would be a great option for us. I'm definitely considering it but don't most MBA programs require some work experience? Do you plan on applying for an MBA directly after graduating?

I've considered a number of options: adding a minor, changing my major completely (implausible now), pursuing an MBA, pursuing certifications or a post-grad diploma in business/finance, or if I'm landing an entry-level job and going from there. Consulting, marketing, and accounting are all areas I'm interested in, and with the right certifications, I think your undergrad won't matter.",comment,7

Even if I communicate my ideas clearly, understand the concepts, write down my thoughts logically etc, it's still hard to get a good grade if the professor feels you haven't nailed the ""point"" of the issue.
