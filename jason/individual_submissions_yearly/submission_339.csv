If you're working on it, and have nothing else of equal importance to do, I would say you should just keep working on it as you await a reply and submit it (unless of course the professor replies back saying you can no longer do so). I think emailing the professor is a good idea so they're also aware that you intend on submitting a final assignment and don't assume you have decided not to. The hard-deadline without petition for late work in ArtSci is January 9th if you recive an extention up until then by your professor, so there's a possibility you may still be able to submit it. Whatever you decide to do, best of luck!",comment,4

At this point you may not get it, because the grades have already been submitted and approved by the department, but you can still try.

Going forward, always email your prof or TA in advance of late assignments. Without communication, they're going to give you a zero on the assignment. There's nothing else they can do. But if you let them know that you're struggling and need more time, they can provide accommodations.

Early and ongoing communication is key.",comment,1
