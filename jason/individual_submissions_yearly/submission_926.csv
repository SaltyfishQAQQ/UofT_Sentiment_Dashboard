I fell below my conditional for one course by 5% do I still have a chance?,Ok-Transition7313,1e6pdfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1e6pdfh/i_fell_below_my_conditional_for_one_course_by_5/,1721345345.0,"I accepted life sci at uoft St. George and one of my requirements was to get an 80% in calculus, but I got a 75%. I already sent my appeal in (parents divorce, moving houses, death in family etc) and let them know I was taking calc in the summer. My overall average is an 86.

Update: THANK U ALL FOR UR REPLIES I JUST GOT AN EMAIL THAT MY GRADES ARE SATISFACTORY!!! ",submission,17
