Like saying something SFW in a NSFW tone, like ""Good student, I know you can take all (course/load/cardinality) courses a term."" ""You are that eager to get more assignments, huh?"" ""Misbehaving student gets punished, for 100% mark deducted as late penalty."" ""Just look at how needy you are, begging me to fill your tight spare time with more projects/reports.""

Or like, you begged, ""Please sir, don't touch my acorn balance, that's sensitive...""

Edit: The midterm is way better than my expectation, though I still feel the same anxiety, but not as panic as I did this post.",submission,66
