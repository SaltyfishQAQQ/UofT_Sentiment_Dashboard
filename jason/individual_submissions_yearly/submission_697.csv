Got two exam question revisions in the middle of my exam ,Prestigious_Peak8407,1gxqr3g,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gxqr3g/got_two_exam_question_revisions_in_the_middle_of/,1732333875.0,"hey guys, I did an exam today and I believe I got the revisions later than everyone else because I was in the accessibility exam room. Two questions had changes one of which was important and since I had got it halfway through my exam I had to redo a question and with only an hour of writing time it felt a bit unfair. Thing is - I have no idea who to talk to about whether I can do a makeup or a rewrite because I ended up needing the 10 or so minutes and couldn‚Äôt finish the last question. The class email has never responded to my other inquiries throughout the sem and if anyone knows who to call/email about something like this please lmk. ",submission,26

I sent an email to the course email and CC'd my academic advisor on it. Make it clear how the process was poorly handled (multiple revisions halfway through the test and instruction on the document was unclear) and how this affected your test taking capacity (i.e., lost time, lost tempo, rushing questions, etc). Just don't make anything up or over exaggerate.

I've gotten 88, 92, 89 in the last 3 tests. I'm expecting somewhere between 65-75 if I'm lucky.",comment,5

I'm going to be talking with my academic advisor in-person. This isn't your fault. It's something academic accommodations and the professor should be sorting out.,comment,3
