I just got an email this evening that i got suspended for a year. I was on probation for last winter semester and i took a summer course this year. But i couldn’t bring myself to gpa higher than 1.70. So they suspended me.
Last day to enroll in the courses is on Monday and they just dropped me out of all my classes today. 
I am on scholarship and i am really worried they will cancel me. I wont be able to continue after that at all because i will not be able to fund myself all these tuition fees. 
I will be talking to my registrar tomorrow but I am worried they will not be lenient :(( 
I feel like the world is collapsing on me. I can’t even sleep. 
I dont know what i will do if they decide to still keep me suspended. And if the scholarship gets cancelled i might just have to go back home and face my parents.",submission,158

I would recommend just accepting this happened. Is it that your cumulative GPA was below 1.7 or the sessional GPA?

Because if it's the cumulative, I would work out the math on what you would have to score in each course, how many courses you would have to take, as well as how you think you can perform based on both the load, the grade(s) required, and your knowledge and confidence in those particular subjects.

I hope it's not insensitive but the whole point of the suspension is to force students that are not performing to their required standards to take a period of time to reflect on what went wrong, what they could've done better, or if the program even is for them. So you should use this period to reflect and map out an action plan.

I'm a UofT alumni who thinks that he's doing pretty decently in my career now but I had a tough journey and I found myself in very similar shoes to you where I had to take a year long break (twice, actually) because I kept failing my final exams. While it was a dark period of my life, it really made me a stronger person and confirmed to me how mentally strong I was to bounce back and turn my life around. I has a lot of great support and I'm sure you do too. Don't let the unsupportive minority overwhelm you.

Good luck. It's not over and you can shape your future still, even when everything feels like it's collapsing in the moment.",comment,79

What program are you in, Alive-Breakfast-9437? Why do you think your grades are so low? Are you having trouble with language or reading comprehension? Do you need a tutor? Do you go to lectures, tutorials, classes? Do you do the readings? Do you complete the assignments? 

What reason would they have to be lenient? Do you have a documented need for accommodation (learning disability, etc.) that is not being met? Are you having medical or personal issues that cause problems or getting medical treatment that causes problems for you? What steps have you taken to get support or academic help e.g. writing centre, peer tutoring, etc?",comment,11

However, they didn't cancel the scholarship on his tuition. I don't know how is it at UofT regarding drop. But if you are absolutely sure about the program, and you had a very good reason for this consequence, you can take this to take a step back and get a big jump. You can try to convince them to not cancel your scholarship, and that you'd bounce back harder.

You should pretty much NEVER ever enrol in summer courses when you’re on probation. I would in fact be more surprised if you don’t get suspended. Reason for that is summer courses run at a much faster pace, and are often a bit more challenging. 

Even in your position however, there’s always a good decision to make. Reflect on why your gpa is the way it is. Was it due to procrastinating? Do your strengths not match the courses you’re taking? Were you missing lectures purposely? I’d say in my opinion, your best move on the board is to sit down and ask yourself these questions. Reflect on your shortcomings. I’d also immediately book an appointment with an academic advisor, they will help you much more than our Reddit page. Good luck my friend!",comment,4

Everyone goes through tough times in their lives. The key is to try to learn from the experience and improve. The fact that you are on scholarship shows that you are capable of high achievement. 

Take the time off and think about the root cause of your recent academic performance. Were you in a program that is not the right fit for you? 

Where do you want your life to be in the future? Think hard about this because it sounds like you are more concerned about ""facing your parents"" than living the life that is best for you. Are you in the current program because of your parents expectations? Or is this the program that you are passionate about?

Your situation now is not a failure. It's an opportunity for you to refocus and come back even stronger.

This happened right before and during Covid, my mental health took a dive. My finances were horrid, didn’t have a job and ruined my relationship the year prior from school stress. I was isolating myself, shutting myself out from family etc….

By the third year (5th year of school technically)
of my degree, I found my stride, developed some good habits, developed some good relationships with profs and had my best year. 4th year was a struggle but I managed to land a permanent job and graduated with my degree finally.

No matter how bad your situation looks, there is always a way out of it. You just need to have an honest look at yourself and figure out what you’re doing wrong, what you’re doing right and come up with a plan.

You also need to realize for school certain behaviours don’t seem super important, but can change your trajectory significantly:

1. Attend every single lecture, don’t skip one out of convenience and only miss it if it’s an absolute necessity. It makes it 10x easier to stay on top of things and just listening to your prof will improve your grades

2.  Start your assignments the day you get them, even its ifs 1 or two problems or just a couple sentences down, getting it started is the biggest hurdle and introducing it into your schedule will help you manage time

3. Keep a running list of due dates and assignments, this will help you ensure that you don’t accidentally miss anything important 

4. Talk to classmates and try to find a group or get into group chats so you have support in your courses

5. Eat clean, get sleep and make sure you get physical exercise. This is so much more important for your mental health than most people realize. It’s just so neglected by almost everyone that it’s never talked about

You got this good luck 😤",comment,1

Maybe the same can happen for you and you can come back strong. I was failing before my suspension, now I haven’t failed a course since and that was the first semester of 2022. Ik it feels awful, especially having to tell you parents (I have immigrant parents so I know how bad it is😂😂). You just gotta be ready to come back and you’ll slowly get yourself out of academic probation when you’re back. You can provide some circumstances as to maybe why your school performance isn’t great. I hope they are lenient with you. Good luck bro",comment,1

Was suspended as well and found out that I had mental health issues that kept me from not succeeding. Eventually got into therapy and changed my perspective of life. 

I know you feel like your whole life is collapsing but believe it or not, the feeling is not permanent. You can always talk to the registrar, but they’re pretty strict with policy. The only thing you can do is to confront your sponsor, and help them see that there are issues with your studies and you’re working on them. Prepare a plan on what you gonna do next and present it so that you won’t lose your scholarship. Appeal to the human aspects of your sponsor!

I guessed you flew from another part of the world to U of T, so it’s hard to acclimate yourself and get used to the surrounding prior to your start of studies. For me, that’s important to academic success, and you can use the time now to go back and make changes in your life. Heck, if you got cut from your sponsor and had to resume studies at your local university, you can always come back to do graduate program. I know a friend who did that. Good luck, and don’t lose hope! And always remember that there many pathways in your life to be successful.",comment,1

If you have had challenges with academics even before uni with highschool especially stuff like handing in assignments late. It might be good to look into seeing if you have any non-visible. A lot of people end up dropping out just because they believe ""college isn't for them"" only to get diagnosed years later and managing with better strategies. It's extremely hard to go through uni when you don't understand your own limits. Sometimes getting accommodations, communicating with profs when you can't attend or finish an assignment in time and taking a lower course load goes a long way.

School is all you know it’s what you have been conditioned to think is the most important thing for the last 18 years so doing poorly sucks, but trust me when you’re looking for a job there are many many other factors that are much much more important. I’m not saying this as some 40
Year old with a family and a happy life, im just a bit older around 25 and struggling as well, but none of my struggles involve my grades during my bachelors",comment,1

Yep. Almost as if I knew what I was talking about... 

So you're asking to be put back on probation instead of being suspended? I hope the registrar was clear with you: the petition/Committee on Standing process is very indepth, it will take a lot of work on your part.",comment,2

Do you recall any conditions on the scholarships such as whether you can take breaks in enrollment or maintain a particular GPA level?

This is definitely a blow, but it's not the end of the world.  Back when the dinosaurs roamed it wasn't that uncommon for students to get an entrance scholarship and lose it after the first year and pick up something after second year once the shock of first year wore off and things got back on track.

I hope things work out for you.",comment,10

Ask if they will be able to give you another chance and put you back in the academic probation. Be sincere and open when explaining getting the low gpa consistently. It really depends on how determined you are to stick with the same program, if not you may be better off switching programs in similar field. Best of luck!!!",comment,1

Could you be undiagnosed as neurodiverse? Are you grieving a loss? Are you overusing substances, partying too much? Are you homesick? Are you sleeping too little or too much? How’s your food situation? Do you have relationship problems? Do you just feel overwhelmed? Do you ever feel like it’s all too much? Any of these things could cause a person who had good grades in one environment to have a bit of a crash and burn in a different environment. Maybe a check in with Student Health Services or your family doctor as soon as you can and have an open discussion about the underlying factors leading to your grades falling. Remember, this is not the end of the world, although I’m sure it feels like it right now. Help is available for you, and this too shall pass and one day it’ll be in your rear view mirror. We’ve all had times we’ve failed at something, you are certainly not alone in that.

When I was first put on suspension, I went to the student Union and they helped me put together an appeal. I got doctor’s notes and all sorts of stuff and submitted the whole appeal. This actually worked for two possible suspensions. Even when they tried to kick me out of the school I was able to sit in front of a panel and win the appeal by showing that the reason I didn’t get the grade I should have received was because of medical reasons (it was an entirely fake story).

Sorry, zoA_, what? The student union helped you with an appeal based on lies? Or, they believed your lies and helped you? Did you lie to the doctors to get medical notes or did they write you fake notes?",comment,11
