I have not even 200$ in my bank account and keep getting ignored when applying for jobs. I'm literally going broke and was at least relying on SOME kind of payment from UTAPS. All my friends and a few people I've talked to said they got at least 800$ (these people are VERY well off financially) so WHY did they deem that I didn't deserve UTAPS grants? I swear everyone I know got something? It's like they're PURPOSELY avoiding paying financially needy people to weed us out or something...??? why is UOFT like this...",submission,29

This lets ppl who are like 23 and above get UTAPS / OSAP regardless of parental income. It could be that factor giving them an advantage 

Additionally, it really is based on parental income. I didn't really need loans since I'm domestic and I saved money from work all through high school (so like 4 years x 16k a year ish; I did lifeguarding), but I applied just to see since my friend wanted help with her apps. In our family, bc we immigrated, my mom was denied working till 2017 bc she had to get re-certified as a doctor so we were struggling 2006 to 2017 😭 but bc of that sudden income spike, I was denied across the board

On the upside it's weird being in a higher income bracket bc the lack of stress is genuinely underrated. Secure income is so good as stress relief 

But yeah that's my perception of it. Additionally, from talking to other rich kids, there's silly things like setting up a shell company and filling income into that with only a meager salary you don't get taxed and only report the small salary + then this CEO parent reports only 45k a year and gets you approved for bursaries 

Then when you need money you take it out of the company funds and call it a business expense 

And other normalized forms of tax fraud lol",comment,11
Why does UTAPS not actually provide for students in REAL need?,NorthernValkyrie19,m0jt1qe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h72bhy/why_does_utaps_not_actually_provide_for_students/m0jt1qe/,1733412220.0,">my parents aren't providing anything but a residence for me 

Is that because they can't or because they won't? According to the website UTAPS is for full-time students who receive *the maximum government financial aid available but whose funding still doesn't cover all their university costs*. So if you aren't getting full OSAP coverage that's because your parents are deemed to have some ability to pay. Whether they're unwilling to is unfortunately not a consideration.

When one of my kids decided they wanted to attend a university away from home, we agreed to cover all their costs for first year, but after that we only paid tuition, fees, and books, and housing and cost of living was on them. They managed with summer jobs, co-op, and part-time work during the school year.",comment,8

My mom was a surgeon in sri lanka and they didn't accept her cert here :/ bc of that she had to go to accelerated med school (2 yrs), specialize (2 yrs), wait for residency (1 yr), get residency (2 yrs) and now she gets paid half a million a year. We came here in 2006 but she started this in 2008 bc she was recovering from pregnancy. Med school was also partially subsidized by the government since she was already a dr and could do ER / EMT shifts (we have a first responder shortage), and we didn't get a ton of debt (except like... the house debt. But buying a house is insane rn), but it was really fucking long 

in the same time my dad got his civil engineering PhD and worked as a professor at various universities to support us but doing all that on one person's income is rough 😭 

I think if you come from America, Europe or Australia you just need to do a certification test and some minor things. They don't make you go through the whole process again.  If you come from a third world place though good luck 💀 i'm lucky that my mom is really damn good at being a doctor and scored very high on all assessments",comment,7
