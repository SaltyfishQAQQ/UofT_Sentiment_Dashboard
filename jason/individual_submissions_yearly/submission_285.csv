"Climbed up from the undergrad ranks, now a PhD student: how did you fair?",Airsofting_TA,1ggwd9z,https://i.redd.it/n1437mb4k7yd1.png,1730431109.0,"Title is pretty self explanatory. I went through undergrad at UofT and had my fair share of ups and down as a student at UofT. Did some stupid things, did some smart things. Got to know a lotta people I should know and some people that I moved on from. Made important friends, two of which I consider my brothers and I will take a bullet for them without hesitation.
Took initiative by canning my ego and talked to a prof. Worked for some profs, got a paper published with a super publisher, and asked if I could do a PhD and got it.
They say there is a lot of luck and faith that goes into one's life.... I agree. But I think it's important particularly for us young folks these days to a) can the ego, b) be the fool who asks questions/for opportunities, and c)know how to and when to tactically deploy your luck. 

Not everything was good though. Missed opportunities for love and life in general, pandemic wiped out my grand parents on both sides-- now I go back to empty childhood homes when I visit China. If I want to visit my grandparents it's at a columbarium.

Body isn't invincible anymore, years of neglect have started to catch up with me. 

But you know what? I've dug my hole and it's a good hole. It took me out the toughest of fights and it's where I cooked my celebratory shin ramen inside the bag with hot water.

Anyways, my abridged player card is the attached image.",submission,95

A degree is what you make of it. If the skills you’re getting are marketable, then you’ll do great, if not, then you’re going to have a tougher time after. A PhD in paleobotany doesn’t have many marketable skills outside of academia; a PhD in something like petroleum geology does. 

If your job path is “academia” then you’re going to have a really rough go of it even in typically marketable fields. It’s best to always have a backup plan and exit strategy.",comment,4

I know people with masters in arts aka literature, maybe some marketable skills but then complain “you’re educated”, fact is are you educated in something there’s jobs available to it and does it pay well.  I know too many people that wanted to experience university etc and took paper mill level stuff then declare themselves genius or unique but in reality it was a paper that just took time to get more than anything else, no one pays for that",comment,2
