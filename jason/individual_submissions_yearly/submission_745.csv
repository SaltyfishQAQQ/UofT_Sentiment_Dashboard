what did you guys do about your extracurriculars? did you quit or continue? and if you stayed, how manageable was it?

I was also a ballerina for 10+ years before I came to uoft for my undergrad.  I ended up discontinuing classes because I came from another country and couldn't find a good studio around.  But I went to a club which mostly do ballet and modern until 3rd year when school work really caught up to me which conflicted with the major exec role i have in the club.

That being said, I know Hart House offers ballet classes over fall and winter semesters.  If I remember correctly, the advance class is on Thursday.  I can never free myself to take the class, but you may have the time to go, depending on the campus you go to and your schedule.

My teacher was quite disappointed seeing me go, and I regret discontinuing dancing at all, seeing that it kept me fit and was a pretty good stress reliever.  I really don't think ""wasting"" a couple of hours per week on an activity you like is going to majorly deteriate your academic abilities, or spending those hours to study will improve your grades a lot (mainly, I'm unlikely to use those hours to study anyways), so I still encourage you to continue dancing, either with your old studio or Hart House or another studio around campus.  If you're ready worried, talk to your teacher about reducing classes and moving you to the more recreational level.  I spent most of my grade 12 attending only 1 class per week to prepare for my standardized exam (and the time ""freed up"" from the other classes was not actually spent on studying).",comment,19

I‚Äôm still doing the sport, but plan to drastically change my priorities in this next semester. My opinion u of t is tough and pretty miserable at times so if u can manage your time don‚Äôt quit something you love doing cause you‚Äôll need it. I‚Äôm in eng for some context and the workload is crazy but if you have enough passion for it you can make it work, but again I took a fight one day before my calc 2 final so that tells you what my priorities where at the time smh üòÖ, just be smart about it.",comment,2

Most of my highschool ECs, yes. But I replaced them with similar ECs in university.

Most of my friends fall into the same boat, instead of quitting they either turn it into something casual or replace it with something they find more manageable. In your situation I believe the first option is best!",comment,1

I'm a history/english/antho student if that helps too. I practice around my schedule and have had to miss a class for a paper before. My whole family is in the ballet/theater world and I know that often ballet has multiple classes a week. But I will say that dancing has saved my mental health in uni. I would not quit if at all possible, because those few hours a week really help me stay active, and not be a uni hermit, by interacting with my hula sisters and everyones families at least once a week. It's not a waste of time in my mind if its going to save you from uni depression/anxiety.",comment,1
