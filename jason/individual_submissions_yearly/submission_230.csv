So I just got off from my meeting with Dr. Patterson regarding my BCH210 draft and how it overlapped with another person's draft. I was presented with both my work and the other unknown person's work and let me say, I was genuinely surprised by the similarity it had with mine, the order of the ideas presented was similar, the wording was only slightly changed. I was shocked. 

But the meeting was more informal than I expected. I explained to Dr. Patterson about the fact that I've worked on this assignment myself, and only myself, because I usually work in my room or in the Robarts commons (I tend to do work myself), and I don't know much about the other people taking this course. Not even during tutorials have I confronted other bch210 students about this. 

She was, nicer than I expected the overall meeting to be, and what she said was mostly about being careful of my work being open in public and not to share the work with anyone else. I am to continue working on the final assignment using the feedback that I received and it shouldn't escalate to a more serious level since this draft is only worth 3% of the final grade. 

So this is nothing serious tbh, I was only genuinely surprised by the similarity the other paper had with mine, but other than that, just continue working on the final. 

If you got any more questions just leave a comment and I'll see if I can answer. 

Gotta get back to preparing for psl300 test today lol ",submission,119

Though I am still sorry that this whole thing started in the first place. You don't even know the other person and yet you still got this is really frustrating.

The shit people say make her out to be some demon but she was genuinely super personal in the summer when I took her class,comment,18

Do you think somehow the other person stole your work (if you left something unattended) or is the thinking that it's possible both of you came up with the ""same"" paper completely independent of each other?

Did you have to provide any proof like edit history of your document ? 

The thought of this happening is very stressful. Glad things worked out this time.",comment,15

Most people fall on the spectrum, and I think this is true for Patterson (I took BCH in 2019).

 Overall I think she's a good teacher, but she tends to immediately blame students when they fail to grasp concepts quickly, which is the fastest way to generate animosity with students. Most older profs can fall into this trap (especially with COVID kids moving through the system) so I'm not surprised this is still happening. I'm also not surprised that she's nicer in the summer; everything is much more laid back and it can incentivize being nicer to students since there are less of them and usually more time to go over material before or after class (source: I TA lifesci, but not bch)

 I'm glad she's being level headed with OP üëçüèæ",comment,3

This will probably not escalate if you don't know the other person who wrote similar stuff as you. The warning is just that make sure you do your own work and don't share your work to anyone else under any circumstances.,comment,9
