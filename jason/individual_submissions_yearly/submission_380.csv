I was with my friends, and we joked about needing another guy in our group so our friend wouldn‚Äôt feel outnumbered by the girls. My friends made a joke and said ‚Äúhow about that guy that just walked in‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt know who they were talking about so I pointed and said ‚Äúhim?‚Äù. At that moment, he looked up, saw me pointing, and pointed back. He ended up sitting with us, and we joked about the interaction. In every other class, we continued to sit as a group and we all became close quickly. After a few months, him and I would try to find times to hang out away from the group, but still just as friends. Then one night, six months into our friendship, our group went out dt and he decided to dd. He drove me home last and when we almost got to my house I said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to go home yet‚Äù. So we ended up driving around and confessed our feelings for one another. Since then, we‚Äôve hung out every day. We motivate each other in school and are both currently applying to work in health care. All because I pointed at a random guy in my class. So yes it is possible. My advice is to not actively seek a relationship; whoever you‚Äôre meant to be with will find their way to you.",comment,100

Let no one tell you that seeking a partner comes secondary to getting educated. Your education is important and so is finding your life partner. Once you leave school, the dating world goes downhill from there, every year that passes. The fact that you are honest that you want a life partner and willing to do what it takes to find that person is a good thing. The one thing I would advise is that you are at a crucial point of your life where getting into a bad relationship can cost you or set you back entirely if you are not careful. So it‚Äôs important to find people who have common foundational values and then filter from that group. You can meet someone anywhere- library, school halls, clubs, etc‚Ä¶ you  have to put yourself out there and talk to people. And when you do find someone you like, you have to make your intentions known.Wish you luck :)",comment,5

Started dating 2nd year after being friends for a year. Both our first relationship! Married now for 2 years and counting. We never thought we would date each other and were really good friends at first (mainly because of cultural and religious differences, I always found her cute). She helped me get into my program as I could not grasp econ concepts for the life of me unless it was explained practically, she just understood me). Then summer of first year we hung out as I was a frosh leader and when 2nd year started I asked her out one night after our econ class. The rest was history. Never hear the end of it about how nervous I was popping the question for the first time in my life and how I was awkward enough to walk her to the bus stop, instead of driving her home after our first date LOL, then not kiss her at all (even though she gave me all the signs). My advice is find stuff you are passionate abut and join clubs where you meet people of similar interests. Also don't hesitate to meet friends of friends and put yourself out there outside of a classroom setting. Sure it's work (extracurriculars) but that is part of the fun of uni! You will definitely miss the craziness and virtually all my friend group that I have 11 years on were built during university. Anyways, I don't want to ramble like an oldie but it's possible man, don't lose hope. In a world of online dating horror stories that I hear from my loved ones, be grateful to be ""forced"" to meet people organically and keep your mind open. You never know! All the best :D!",comment,1
