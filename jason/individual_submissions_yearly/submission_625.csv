Also I presume if you're a few years out of grad, you're probably not lurking this subreddit much.

1. Program Major/spec?
Econ major
2. Do you research, work for a company, pursuing further education, unemployed?
Work for a bank
3. TC if you work?
3 YOE, TC about 210k USD
4. Are you based in Canada or did you move?
New York - moved after graduation
5. How much do you think your degree helped you in the real world with what you currently do now?
To some degree it helped, but I honestly think I was really lucky with sufficient preparation.
6. Would you choose your program at uoft again / was it worth it?
I didn't start with Econ, I probably would've tried to go to Ivy at Western instead if I knew I was going to finance. I started off in Material Science. Was it worth it? I think it was (despite being International), because I got to where I am today. If this didn't work out the way it did, definitely not worth it. It's really expensive to be an international student here. I also made some amazing friendships and experiences during my time in Toronto.",comment,9
