Is UofT's Indigenous land acknowledgement accurate? ,TheHumbleDuck,1d78res,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d78res/is_uofts_indigenous_land_acknowledgement_accurate/,1717432335.0,"I've always been a bit unsure about UofT's land acknowledgement: ""For thousands of years it has been the traditional land of the Huron-Wendat, the Seneca, and the Mississaugas of the Credit"".

No mention of the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, or the Haudenosaunee. And it's the only acknowledgement in Toronto I've seen mentioning the Seneca. Just from my preliminary research, ~~it doesn't seem the Seneca even lived in the GTA~~, their traditional territory is south of the Lake, although they used this area nomadically for hunting. But seems weird to acknowledge Seneca but not the others.

Maybe there's something I'm missing. Anyone have any insight?",submission,32

ETA: and https://mncfn.ca confirms the Mississaugas of the Credit are Anishinaabe. (I don’t know whether the U of T acknowledgement still leaves out peoples that should be included.)",comment,23

It's the ""thousands of years"" that is wrong.  The *treaty* is with the Mississauga, who were not in the Toronto area until like 1700.  Before that, the region was cleared in the Beaver Wars by the Haudenosaunee who then used it as hunting grounds, but more or less weren't residing here.  Before that, as far as we know historically it was Huron-Wendat in the Toronto area, a group that is basically in Quebec and Oklahoma as a result of first wars with the Haudenosaunee then with Europeans.

Look at every other university land acknowledgement in Ontario.  You will see a reference to ""traditional territory"" and a reference to a specific treaty.  U of T is essentially the only one who deosn't do that.  I have no idea why, but I suspect part of the reason is related to the particular groups the leadership in our indigenous services offices belong to.  We have seen similar changes before: Jesse Thistle, who was a PhD student at York and who is Metis himself, got the city of Toronto to drop ""Metis"" from their land acknowlegment because historically there was no Metis community in Toronto.

Accuracy is important. It bugs me every time I hear it that we say factually incorrect things at the start of university events.",comment,19

Classifications for Indigenous peoples can also get tricky because some communities are parts of larger ones and are known under overlapping names.   
  
Source: I'm Chippewa according to documentation, but the Chippewa are also known as Ojibwe, but this group also contains Saulteaux and Oji-Cree peoples, and several others. Indigenous group nomenclature is still getting refined contemporarily!",comment,15

It’s possible UofT created this acknowledgment with an outdated version of the website when it was getting started several years ago. It’s a good point to bring up that it should be updated and I’m wondering what the right channels to discuss that would be.",comment,6

I just don't know why UofT focuses on the Seneca when it seems the entire confederacy shared this land. 

And Anishinaabe I understand covers a huge territory, who have traditionally used this land, while the Mississaugas of the Credit is a specific nation within it that holds the most recent claim to the territory, so both are acknowledged.",comment,4

I looked into it and it's true the Seneca did establish villages and perhaps had the most notable presence in the area of all the nations in the Haudenosaunee, but nothing seems to suggest it was always a strict Seneca presence, the push north was an effort by the entire confederacy, and there was Mohawk presence too, such as in the village of Teiaiagon.

Also the Anishinaabe and Ojibwe are missing from the acknowledgement, which I don't understand, and are generally acknowledged everywhere else *alongside* the Mississaugas. Just seems incomplete",comment,1
