I’m a member of the disciplinary tribunal. This is my advice alone and is not an official stance of the tribunal. 

At this point there is very little you can do. They may still look at the evidence and decide it’s nothing, or they may move to have a meeting with the student. The Prof has concerns and it is their obligation to forward those concerns to the next level (it’s literally their obligation to the department).

If the department wants to meet with you, go to the meeting and be truthful. At this point, think of it like a police interview. You haven’t been charged, they’re just doing some poking around.

Do not panic. If they ask a question and you don’t know, say “I don’t know.” Keep your answers clear and precise. As much as possible, keep the conversation free of extraneous information. At the tribunal, we read summaries of these meetings and the clearer the meeting is, the easier it is for us to figure out what is happening.    

If you genuinely did not cheat, provide information to others, or share your answers, then say so. If you can provide a version history of the document, do so. If you have other evidence to provide, bring it to the meeting. 

Ask for a transcript/summary of the meeting or record it. You are legally allowed in Ontario to make a recording of any conversation that you are a part of, and I can’t find anything disallowing it in the student code of conduct. They don’t need to give their permission. 

Ask them to provide the evidence for their concerns at the meeting. If they provide them, do not comment, ask for copies. If they refuse, then that is something a lawyer will deal with later if needed. 

At this level, they are gathering information. You should be too. They are seeing if they have a case, you should be looking for what they think they have. To a degree, this is a game of trying to suss out information on both sides. This meeting goes one of a few ways:

1) they decide it’s not worth it to move ahead,

2) they try to extract a confession out of you and succeed,

3) if a confession is not forthcoming, and they believe their case to be strong, they will forward it up to the next level of the chain.

Depending on your faculty, that could be to the faculty level or up to the provost’s office. 

At that point, you should take no further meetings without legal counsel. They believe they have a case and you have been “charged” so to speak. Their only goal is to get a conviction, and setting aside the charge becomes much less likely. At this point, no further Reddit posts on the matter and you don’t discuss it with anyone but your lawyer. 

If you were to reach the tribunal level, know that you have people on the “bench” who genuinely have the best interest of the student and the university in balance. We are committed to fair and due process. We are not stooges for the university. We want what is reasonable given the circumstances. The tribunal may challenge the prosecutor on their punishments, if they find them to be outside what is reasonable. We also do push back on evidence when we think it’s sketchy. That said, if everyone is cheating, then the fancy degree we all pay tens of thousands of dollars for becomes meaningless. That means that cheating hurts us all, and it is our responsibility to curb it as much as possible. 

Good luck! Stay calm! It’ll be alright one way or another, I promise.",comment,31

If you did not cheat, then all you need to do is explain yourself and provide your evidence. If you suspect that you did commit some form academic integrity, you may want to be honest right away. Honesty is valued, especially if the assignment is worth less than 10% (it is easier to settle it earlier than to escalate this matter to up the departmental food chain).

Some other things to consider:

In addition to what some students said regarding providing time stamps and multiple drafts, ask yourself if you collaborated with any students,  and if you did how so. Did you share ideas verbally, but go home to write your own draft? Did you show the student any version of your draft? The former is fine, but the latter is problematic.

Did you use ChatGPT? It is possible two students entered the same assignment prompt, and ended up with similar variations of the assignment. You would need to be forthcoming about this. We (instructors) know that students use this, and it is in itself not a problem entirely, depending on the context, if you use it as a guide, and not copy and paste the solution that they generate. This is something to consider in the future for any students that do use this.

Goodluck!",comment,23

As someone who went through similar process on MAT246 in Winter 2024 (some small assignments that were flagged as significantly similar to another student because the other student copied my work), I have got an important question to ask:

**Did you show your draft to anyone else? And if so, did the other person copied a portion of your work?**

Gather evidence such as chat history and edit times if you experienced peer pressure (i.e. another person is pressuring you to share your draft while you never wanted to). That was what I experienced in MAT246 in Winter 2024 and I handled it when the allegation came out using this method.

Note that you are NOT allowed to show your draft to anyone else. 

But if you didn't do anything wrong, then just show the submission and edit times and send it to your prof or the biochem department for supplementing evidence, and lawyer up if necessary. 

And also, at ALL times, BE HONEST.

I received this regarding my BCH210 draft and I'm worried,ImperiousMage,lvyatub,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1glu7rt/i_received_this_regarding_my_bch210_draft_and_im/lvyatub/,1731008961.0,"I sit on the disciplinary tribunal. I can practically guarantee that there have been no false convictions, based on my experience. This is because resources for the tribunal are so tight that only the most egregious examples ever make it to us. The provost’s office has no time for more and neither do we.",comment,5

Even though they are convinced, they still reported me to SAI because there were multiple small assignments (worth around 12% in total) that were flagged.

And when I showed my evidence to the Dean's Designate (I sent an email to SAI containing all the evidence a few days before my Dean's Designate meeting), the Dean's Designate was convinced that I did not do the offence on purpose, I showed my work to another student because of peer pressure, and I never intended to show my work to anyone else. I ended off with only a reprimand with no mark deductions.",comment,1

They won’t be much help in this moment since they have to triage their services. 

OP can try, but it’s pretty unlikely they’ll get a response in time.",comment,19

Except that it *is* different than a typical civil proceeding, since the courts are not the ones suing you--it's the crown or a legal person--and then passing down a ruling. I get that the prosecutorial and judicial or sentencing entities are nominally siloed from one another--but come on, that's a bit of a kangaroo court system.

Yes, it's your opinion, I appreciate that. I guess your insider perspective is ultimately a net good. Again, it's at least jarring that in offering advice you also make it depressingly plain how slipshod the process's structure actually is.

Managed by lawyers who know what they’re doing and who are very good at following the letter and spirit of the regulations. 

The departmental level is an atrocity of passing the buck which results in the provost’s office dealing with situations that should be handled at the departmental level and/or dropped. It’s frustrating to say the least.",comment,4

I'm glad the lawyers are as right-headed as you say. 

I hope that OPs case works out and that no one suffers.",comment,3
