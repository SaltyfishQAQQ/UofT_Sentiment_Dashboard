What Are the Privileges of Being a UTSG Student? :),AnalystMoney3509,1eh7u6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1eh7u6r/what_are_the_privileges_of_being_a_utsg_student/,1722486496.0,"Hey everyone, I'm curious about the privileges and benefits we get as students.

* I know we have Wi-Fi access across campuses, but does that extend to the college residences as well? 
* Are there any specific student discounts available at local businesses or events? (I'm aware of UNiDAYS for Apple discount, etc.)
* Do we have access to gym facilities and sports programs for free or at a discounted rate?
* Any clubs I should look into joining?
* Most importantly, do we get free transit passes? (I have done my research and only found UTM)
* What libraries do we have access to on and off campus? Also, what is the name of the online library resource platform?
* Do we get any software or tech perks, like free access to certain programs or platforms? (I am aware of word document, powerpoint, excel, and one note from outlook)
* Are there any health and wellness services provided for students?
* What kind of support is available for mental health and counseling?
* And are there any other perks I should be aware of?

Thanks in advance for your help!",submission,44

2) Metro had one, TTC has a post secondary pass. There were other posts about this topic, use the search bar on subreddit
3) Gym membership is included with your tuition. You will need your tcard to enter
4) depends on what you like
5) Yes only UTM has free pass, you can get a discounted pass, but if you are going to live on campus, the pass is not worth it imo
6) You should have access to all libraries on campus, some of them require Tcard (like robarts) For online, you have access to many databases. Check the UofT library website.
7) Apart from microsoft things, not really. I donâ€™t know any UofT specific free software but you can get JetBrains IDE and Github Premium for free as an university student. There are probably other free software for all university students.
8) There is health and wellness center. Look them up for details
9) Again, health and wellness center
10) Again, use google or just search bar on reddit, there has been other discussions about student perks and some of them has really comprehensive lists.",comment,18

Iâ€™ve done my research on transportation and found out that UTM students get free public transport (I could be wrong as I havenâ€™t read much) while UTSG students only get a discount. ðŸ™ƒ Each campuses got their own different things.,comment,0
