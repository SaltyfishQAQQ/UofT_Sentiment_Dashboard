How were you able to land an entry level job out of school?

I find that true entry level work is pretty rare. On indeed I see maybe 2 - 3 a day and this is in accounting.

I understand the upper 1/3rd of students will probably land something since they have high gpa and I assume those types of keeners would go to networking events etc. But not everyone does that. What happens to the bottom 2/3.

It doesn't. I have sub 3.5 GPA. Never put it on any CV and no one ever asked for it.

I'm in my 4th year now and literally no one has ever asked me about my GPA. Networking doesn't do you much as well tbh. Just polish yourself as much as possible. If you can network, do it but what really matters is your experience (clubs and projects)",comment,5

But it‚Äôs not enough to get a job (outside of academia, like research). 

In certain programs where courses highly reflect your work, recruiters may opt to see a high GPA as it shows basic competency. But for example, engineering, your courses are not even close to what you do on field (it‚Äôs very broad). So it‚Äôs natural for recruiters to care more about your hands on experience than your GPA, that‚Äôs why most internships only have a threshold for 2.7-3.0 to apply (if they have a threshold at all). Usually if they ask for a transcript during your application process, they have a cut off they are looking for; else, they don‚Äôt care. 

Surprisingly networking events are filled with people with failing marks to those with exceptional grades. Why should your GPA stop you from connecting? In this type of market, all you can do is hope a recruiter takes a liking to you. And in career fairs, maybe 10% of them actually even consider the GPA of the student.

The way I see it is, a high GPA usually means you‚Äôll win the tie breaker between other candidates. Something along the lines of you being a ‚Äúsafe bet‚Äù. But with no relevant experience, you can guarantee that a 3.0 GPA with any relevant experience will get the job. 

Also, post graduation in most fields your GPA is pointless. No one will ask for it, they will ask you for your experience, where you‚Äôve worked before, what you have to offer. Unless you apply to those post grad program, those usually have some level of GPA requirement. 

Bottom line, average people usually get internships the same way ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù people do. You just need to hustle in career fairs and events. Build your personal, technical, interview skills and hunt for any relevant experience. 

See it this way, if a recruiter never checks candidates‚Äô GPA, how will they know who‚Äôs average? Focus on building those things.",comment,1
