"I applied to literally only one, very competitive work study and got an offer, here‚Äôs my advice ",ricardomortimer,1f22clt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f22clt/i_applied_to_literally_only_one_very_competitive/,1724714395.0,"
I was told after my 4 rounds of interviews that they got 2000+ applicants for this role. That‚Äôs insane. 

Here is my advice by the way: 

TAILOR. YOUR. RESUME.

- Highlight relevant skills and experiences that match the job description. 
- Don‚Äôt apply to positions that have nothing to do with your experience or your skills. Your application will get tossed.
- Use keywords from the job posting in your resume. This helps your resume get noticed and shows that you‚Äôre a good fit for the position.
- Showcase academic achievements, especially if they relate to the position. Including your GPA can helps! 
- Include volunteer work and extracurricular activities if you don‚Äôt have much work experience.

NETWORKINGGG!!!!

- DONT BE SHY TO EMAIL!!! I emailed a total of 5 people from the team to talk about how my experience and skills align perfectly with the role. I also emailed the manager. You will be surprised how you can find anyone‚Äôs UofT email through contacts, teams and websites! 
- Make sure your cover letter is GENUINE. It‚Äôs very easy to spot ChatGPT. People are not stupid.
- Connect with professors and academic advisors who might have connections within the university. They can recommend you for work-study positions.
- Use LinkedIn by connecting with university staff or departments you‚Äôre interested in. 
Networking is a crucial part of landing a work-study position. Building relationships and tailoring your resume effectively will significantly increase your chances of success!! 


Good luck and hope you all can also find success in work study applications. ",submission,92

Tailoring your resume and networking are game changers. As an international student, I found that using Halp was really beneficial too.

the second interview was behavioural and then the third was technical, in between I also had a technical assessment to submit, these were 30 min 

the assessment took me a whole day tbh 

my last one was with the head of the team, 30 mins  again, this was more about deciding whether I‚Äôm the right fit and all",comment,2

Never copy and paste without editing, its so unbelievably obvious. Especially in job applications, gpt overly uses ‚Äúeager‚Äù and ‚Äúexcited‚Äù from my personal experience. And also tends to repeat similar sentences in the intro and conclusion‚Ä¶I usually take 2-3 sentences from gpt to use in my body paragraph.
