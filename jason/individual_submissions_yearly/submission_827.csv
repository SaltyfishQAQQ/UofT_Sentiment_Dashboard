I have one course in the summer which is pol 101 and I am confident I can get atleast a B in that but I have been advised to drop that course and start fresh in the fall. I’m freaking out and basically want to run away and die . Any people who have been in a similar position , I would love any advice you have to share. I need all the help I can get ",submission,19

Counseling also might be a good idea, if that's not already something you're doing. You could also consider taking a reduced course load next semester?

There is nothing wrong with that. Also, don’t think for one second you can’t bounce back and have a successful academic or professional career. There are so many students that have performed poorly in at least one and even 2 years of undergrad and have gone on to competitive graduate and professional programs. Many admissions committees account for this and love seeing an upward trend.",comment,6

A summer course is 4X the speed and stress of a regular course and it sounds like you need time to rest and get yourself together. Summer courses are really only for when you need them, and if you’re being advised to drop it and come back fresh in the fall, do it. School will wait, your health will not.",comment,7

So, first year? you're just starting out, it's OK to make some mistakes. I'd say don't be too hard on yourself, and try again.",comment,6

This is not the end, I know it's a shit feeling but you will pull through. 

I failed every single class due to really bad mental health. For me, good mental health is probably the most important factor in succeeding at UofT (and of course it just helps with life in general), so try to work on that, whatever it takes. After I did that and also matured a bit more, I was gradually able to improve my grades - year 3 and 4 I had a 4.0 GPA. My CGPA is still pretty low due to first year, but for grad school, they only generally care about the last two years (unless you want to do med or law). Anyway, the path was a bit harder than for most, and it took some extra time to graduate, but I did and was still able to find a good job.",comment,5

Especially with the first year students. Its normal. U know if you got like high 90 or 80 in high school but ended up with lower mark in university first year, it’s happens. When I was first year in different university, first semester, I almost failed all of them only passed one of them and I find the transition from hs to uni is a biggest jump on. Ended up with academic probation. So I was told to take reduced course and with this I was able to improve my grades and boost my confidence. So for your situation, i think it’s gonna be extremely hard to catch it up. I think instead of taking 5, try to take at least 3-4 courses, this may reduce stress. Other things, it would better to talk with wellness counsellor, explain this situation and they will tell you for the next steps. They are very understanding in your situation.",comment,3

The summer months usually are a good chance to get a break, and perspective. If you're interested in the course, then that's good. But if you're taking it just to catch up, and not really into it, maybe not. And, grades aren't everything.",comment,2

She had been dealing with a lot too but came back stronger than before. She probably ended up getting A- or B+ in the course which was a great grade for that course.
Hang in there and use the summer to reset. You are dealing with a lot and from my personal experiences, loved ones’ health issues and general unhappiness take a heavy toll on you. If you can, please consider therapy too.
If you were a runner and had your legs injured, you would have taken rest and recover. You can’t run fast with an injured leg. Same with your studies.
All the best!",comment,2

Do what's best for you OP, and don't worry about external judgement. Many people switch majors, take longer than 4 years, get placed on academic probation, get suspended, but still find a way to graduate from this school.

Unlike what others have suggested, i recommend taking pol101 over the summer. Try and get a good grade, with it will come a sense of accomplishment.
