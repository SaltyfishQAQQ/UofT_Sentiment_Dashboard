"Uoft is easy, all courses are easy, controlling myself is harder than everything, until, 9 weeks passed reading week passed, the moment I'm totally cooked",Secretlntroverted,1ghoosf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ghoosf/uoft_is_easy_all_courses_are_easy_controlling/,1730521730.0,"Before the first week of the fall term. I have two goals. 

1. I want to get 95+ on my final marks of every courses.
2. I want to socialize and make friends.

I've planned to study everything before lecture, and to review everything after class.

In reality, I didn't prepare my first week. I'm left behind. Second week: I didn't study before lec. I spending too much time on the internet. Time goes by. I put little effort on every assignment. I got quite good mark for math and stats class.
However, I'm totally lost for cs courses.

I didn't make any friends. I didn't approach anyone and no one also didn't approach me to become friends. I stopped my goal of having friends because I have to study.

I always plan to study for the entire day but I always ended spent too much time on my phone. I regretted, but because of it I didn't study because I already fail not to wasting time. I planned to study hard tomorrow but after the day came I loss my self again and I ended up didn't study.

I'm lost, I lost my motivated to study. I postponed my time. So that I didn't even study math and stats. I didn't study any course. (I did study but it was only 8% of my expectation so i considered it as not studying)



Before the term started.

My target was studying at least 8 hours eveyday. 
In reality. I only studied for less than 4 hours a week. (Out side of lectures/tutorials/labs).

Time goes so fast so that 9 weeks that went by unconsciously. 

I think I'm bad at CS. But, I didn't put efforts so I shouldn't say I'm bad unless I've tried my best. I didn't tried my best, this is probably my worst effort.

I felt so bad and I only have 5 weeks before final exam.


I won't kill myself. I will keep trying until the end. I won't give up.


Just a reminder for me and for everyone.

1. We have a responsibility.

We not only do things that make us happy. We don't have to do things that we like. We do things as our responsibility. Always be responsible for every act we did. Always think what will we do if everyone can see what we're doing. We won't procrastinate if there's someone else who can see we procrastinate.

2. Discipline is the thing that make us success.

Motivation is not enough. Motivation can goes away. Motivation can change. I feel motivated for tomorrow to study. But after I slept and I wake up. I don't have the motivation again.

Just do the thing we already planned to do. Make our rule for ourselves. If we planned to study for 4 hours for example. Do it no matter what. Even if we sad, overthinking, curious on other people lives on social media, just study and complete all of our tasks before doing anything that isn't according to our plan.

""I'll do it later => I'll never do it""

The more we postpone our plan, the more depressed we are, because we're piling up our task with less time to do it.

""Time is not waiting for you"".

Life goes on, no matter how bad you are in the past. You'll never able to go back to your past life to fix your life. 

You can only do what you can in the present to fix your future life.


I stayed in this cycle because I always blaming my old self (from week 1 -> week 2->...->week9->now). This wasted too much of my time by overthinking it and being not productive.

I'll stop blaming my old self and just think of what I can do in the present for my future.

When you set a really high goal and then don't meet it, it's demoralizing and doesn't exactly make you feel good about yourself or ready to try again the next day. When the goal isn't exactly clear (like I will understand X concept as an example), it can be hard to put in place a plan to get there. 

I personally find it more useful not to set a goal number of hours to study, but a tangible ""place to stop"" in my studying. For example, if I have an exam in a week and 7 lectures to study, I say ""okay, everyday leading up to the exam I'm going to review a lecture's worth of the content"". If I have an assignment due in 2 weeks, I'll set different goals everyday- like today, I'm going to choose my topic. Tomorrow, I'll write an introduction. By Friday I'll have a full draft. By Wednesday, I want to be wrapping up editing it. Doing this, I actually have tangible goals to work towards, it's motivating/rewarding to finish things up, I make sure that I stay on track because I'm keeping track of what needs to get done, etc. You can also get to a point everyday where you've done enough that you feel you can reward yourself (ex., by spending that time on your phone, gaming, whatever makes you happy).",comment,2

**Preface**

1. I only do this because I work on school + I am studying my LSAT.
   1. If I was not studying my LSAT, 4 hours a day studying consistently is sufficient

**Addressing your statements**

**Statement 1**

>I didn't make any friends. I didn't approach anyone and no one also didn't approach me to become friends. I stopped my goal of having friends because I have to study.

You're being incredibly hard on yourself. I am currently in fourth year, and my friend group literally only consists of 2 people I met throughout these last 4 years. To make a lifetime friend in university is as difficult as finding a lifetime romantic partner. This is because your values and personalities usually have to align to actually create a long lasting friendship.

**Statement 2**

>Just do the thing we already planned to do. Make our rule for ourselves. If we planned to study for 4 hours for example. Do it no matter what. Even if we sad, overthinking, curious on other people lives on social media, just study and complete all of our tasks before doing anything that isn't according to our plan.

This is pretty unrealistic, I mean this in the sense that we all wish we could do this, but we usually fail to do so for a multitude of reasons.

Second year, I planned out everything and I told myself that no matter what, I will do my school work at this time.

However, that never happened. Why: Because why would I study when I can click another button on my PC and play a video game.

**Statement 3**

>I always plan to study for the entire day but I always ended spent too much time on my phone. I regretted, but because of it I didn't study because I already fail not to wasting time. I planned to study hard tomorrow but after the day came I loss my self again and I ended up didn't study.

This is a pretty unrealistic goal. You first must build the habit of studying before even attempting to study for long periods of time. I.e you cannot go from 0 hours a day to 8 hours a day studying, you have not built the discipline nor the habits to do this.

**Statement 4**

>My target was studying at least 8 hours everyday. In reality. I only studied for less than 4 hours a week. (Out side of lectures/tutorials/labs).

>Time goes so fast so that 9 weeks that went by unconsciously.

>I think I'm bad at CS. But, I didn't put efforts so I shouldn't say I'm bad unless I've tried my best. I didn't tried my best, this is probably my worst effort.

>I felt so bad and I only have 5 weeks before final exam.

Okay, studying 8 hours everyday is incredibly difficult but not impossible. 5 weeks until the final exam is sufficient time (in my opinion) to secure a good grade in whatever final you are doing.",comment,2

To study for 8 hours a day on average (sometimes more, sometimes less), you first must understand how discipline works.

You can be the most disciplined person in the world, however, if there are things around you that distract you, you will end up not studying.

**Example 1:** I have a gaming computer in my room, if I study in my room, I will end up gaming after a few hours. This breaks your focus, makes you feel terrible, and most likely will prevent you from studying at all that day.

**Example 2:** Lets say your favorite food is a hamburger and you are trying to abstain from eating hamburgers for a whole year. It would be impossible to stick to this diet if there was always a hamburger by your side 24/7. As we are not robots, there is always a slim chance that you will eat that hamburger, thus ending your diet (not really but you know what I mean). This is what it is like studying with distractions, whether it be your phone, or video games.

To solve this, we must create an environment which removes as many temptations as possible.

**Here is a step by step guide on how to study**

**Environment:** Personal room VS Public studying area.

Can you study in your dorm room? Or are you like me (get distracted by gaming computer)

1. If you cannot study at your dorm room, proceed to next step.
2. If you can study at your dorm room, and there are no distractions skip next step.

**Environment:** Figure out if noisy vs quiet environment is better.

1. One of my friends studies in cafe's all the time, he says how the background noise keeps him focused.
   1. I hate the cafe, i get distracted when i hear people talking, so i always go to Robarts and situate myself on one of the quiet floors.
2. So, to test this. Start at a quiet floor on Robarts, set a timer, see how long you can keep focused for.
   1. Then time your focus at a cafe.
   2. Be honest with yourself, this is only for your benefit. If you lose focus, stop the timer immediately.
   3. Did you stay focused longer at Robarts or the cafe?
   4. Repeat until there is a obvious preferable environment, proceed to next step.
   5. If both environments work, proceed to next step.

**Studying:** Setup sitting area.

1. Put phone on do not disturb
2. Set timer
3. Begin work",comment,2

1. Many of you have heard of the Pomodoro technique, I don't actually use it.
   1. I find that I can concentrate for 1-2 hours sometimes, I don't find I need a break after.
   2. I also find that during the Pomodoro break, I usually watch videos, which go over the break time and negatively impact my study session.
   3. So, to make myself feel good, I just track the time I studied, gamifying the process.
2. However, some people find that the Pomodoro technique increasing their efficiency.
   1. So I would recommend trying it, if the 25 minute 5 minute break split works, use it.
   2. When I use it, I usually do 1 hour work period 5 minute break.

**Studying:** Realistic standards and more advice.

1. As previously noted, you cannot immediately start studying for 5 hours every day.
   1. Set a realistic standard, start at 3 hours each day and slowly build it.
   2. It is like going to the gym one day and expecting to be jacked, that's impossible.
      1. You have to build your muscle over time, day after day slowly increasing the weight you use.
   3. Maybe one day you feel tired and you only study 2 hours, that's fine, don't beat yourself up over it.
      1. Sometimes I study 12 hours (2pm to 2am)
      2. Sometimes I study 3 (2pm-5pm)
      3. Sometimes, I don't study at all
2. Go on walks, go to the gym, physical activity.
   1. One thing I heard that I really liked was the idea that physical activity was a way to rest the mind, while studying was a way to rest the body.
3. You have to enjoy it.
   1. I find that if you enjoy the process, the results will show that.
      1. I've been really enjoying school this year, and so far, I have a 4.0gpa.
      2. This is because i have been excited to write an essay, excited to learn a new concept.
      3. It sounds weird but try to find ways to be excited for what you are doing.
      4. This mainly is because of a note taking application I use called Obsidian.

**Conclusion**

You are correct when you say that motivation only brings you so far and that discipline is key. Nevertheless, discipline is something incredibly hard to have and something which must be built overtime. If you need any more help, shoot me a dm!",comment,2
