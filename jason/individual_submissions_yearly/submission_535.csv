Unpopular opinion on study space recommendations ,AmbitiousHonesty,1ez5v3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ez5v3t/unpopular_opinion_on_study_space_recommendations/,1724394709.0,"The best way to study on campus in my opinion is to walk into a random large* lecture hall, sit down, and study there for the rest of the day. This won't work if you're someone who studies in a quiet space, but otherwise I find quite a few benefits in it:

1. Harder to procrastinate because you'll feel the time going by. Every hour, a crowd of people move out and another crowd of people get in. Psychologically, you'll be checking your progress every hour.

2. It feels like the professor is watching you, so even during study breaks, you probably won't feel like scrolling your phone. This effectively prevents a 5-minute break becoming a 30-minute scrolling. 

3. During study breaks, you can listen to the lecture and you'll probably learn something interesting, even if not thoroughly. And even if you don't finish your work because you, by any chance, find the course fun and decided to listen, it's not a bad thing, as long as you're learning something. 

4. Every week and every day, you can walk into different lecture halls. You'll get to experience many lecture halls that you normally wouldn't know (e.g. engineering students normally wouldn't take courses outside of engineering buildings).

5. Random lecture halls, random courses, random professors, random students sitting beside. Randomness is exciting. 

*Better choose large lecture halls so that the professors won't care or notice whether you're listening. 

I feel that I'm the only one doing this, but everyone should try. (Hopefully, without causing trouble to the school.)",submission,42
