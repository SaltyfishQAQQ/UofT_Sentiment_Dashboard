I graduated a few years ago, decided what I wanted to do in my third year, and then landed in a field that‚Äôs related but not directly what I aimed for in year 3. it‚Äôs fulfilling as hell (community work) and pays the bills. 

give yourself patience, keep trying new things, keep your mind open, and along the way looking for internship and volunteer experiences, you‚Äôll notice you‚Äôve cultivated your network. (my personal rec) get involved in student government!",comment,1

Almost everything has a business component because money LOL. If you want to do work that isn‚Äôt driven by profits, and instead community impact or societal impact work for a non profit , or start your own non profit. Non profits can be anything. It‚Äôs usually a lower paying job but if you develop expertise in something like grant writing or are someone specialized it‚Äôs just as lucrative and you‚Äôll be competing in a smaller pond. 

Business grad myself, and people come out of these programs with all sorts of jobs, or no jobs even with coops. The biggest regret from everyone was always not trying more types of roles and more industries. The best time is when you‚Äôre cheap subsidized labour.

It‚Äôs okay to be in school a bit longer to do more internships. Find an area you‚Äôre good at and you are okay with.

A lot of people aren‚Äôt the brightest is what you will (hopefully) learn when you enter the working world. That doesn‚Äôt matter though because for most people their career is for stability and money, not fulfillment. Figure out what you want out of life and then what job, work, or career complements it most. 

It‚Äôs not that serious. Don‚Äôt overthink it. Just ‚Äúdo‚Äù and invest your time in undergrad to figure out what you want to try for your first career. Most people switch careers and/or will go back to school anyways.

Also work on your logic and critical thinking. Overthinking is a waste of time. Maybe try some therapy like CBT while you‚Äôre young to help frame your thoughts and emotions.


What I did when I was your age was take tests like MBTI and learning + working style quizzes. I also did an official IQ test for disability concerns. The IQ test told me my strengths and relatively where I was slightly weaker. I didn‚Äôt listen and worked on improving my weaknesses. Now that I think more clear, the work I do and excel at (which pays decently) matches all the tests I‚Äôve done and my mbti. It took me a long time to get there because I was rejecting it. Some of it is fun pseudo science but if you really want an answer now for an area to invest it, take an mbti test and try one of the business relevant roles that it recommends. You‚Äôll build soft skills in it that are useful in future roles. You just need to pick one and start, learn, and then pivot.",comment,1
