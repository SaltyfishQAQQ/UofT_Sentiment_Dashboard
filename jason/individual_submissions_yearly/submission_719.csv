Not sick enough to go to hospital but sick enough to have impact on exam,Klutzy-Temporary1255,1h8r9uw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h8r9uw/not_sick_enough_to_go_to_hospital_but_sick_enough/,1733573822.0,I have an exam later today but I guess something was spoiled in my dinner last night because I’ve been going to bathroom every 5 minutes. If it was just a normal day I would probably just keep using the bathroom until I feel better but I have an exam later and am wondering if I should go to the hospital so I can defer my exam I have today. I really don’t want to sit in a hospital for hours for something I know time will solve but at the same time I know if I write the exam and I need to use the bathroom during the exam I’m gonna be screwed. What do yall advise in this situation? ,submission,25

You are physically not going to be able to attend the exam.

Now what you will do is you will seek help from a walk-in clinic for a diagnosis - and a form of VOI from your physician. They will probably charge you 20-30 bucks and they do transaction in cash or etransfer only, so be ready for that. 

You would then return home, mail your registrar and seek their advice on filing your first exam deferral petition. This is presumably your first petition so it would most likely be easy - read through the website, write your personal statement and attach that as a pdf document (do not use their provided space - its too limiting) and keep in touch with your college’s registrar. 

Good luck.",comment,29
