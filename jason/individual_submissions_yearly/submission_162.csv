I walked around inside after the fire department had left. On the third floor, they have a hallway closed off. I checked out the southern stairwell, and it looks and smells horrible in there. Soot everywhere, terrible smell, pools of water, etc. I didn't get to see where the fire started or spread, since they have most of it taped off.",comment,43

Everything was contained to that floor and a stairwell, and business is back to usual except for that area.

There are research and teaching labs in the building, hence the people in lab coats (white lab coats = undergrads, blue lab coats = TAs) but they just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. (Ironically, the people who work in the building were the people standing outside without lab coats because we would have left our lab coats inside lol.) Fire is unrelated to the labs and people in lab coats. 

Fire prevention was doing a training session in the building. They were not the ones to pull the alarm.",comment,21
