For example, in the article titled '85 percent of UTM math class fail exam, sparking discussion on department shortcomings', I felt the title was a bit unfair, as it implied the issue was primarily with the department. After the exam in question was shared online, many people in the discussion threads([1](https://old.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1c5zivv/heres_a_copy_of_the_infamous_29_average_mat224/), [2](https://old.reddit.com/r/UTM/comments/1c5zf8x/heres_a_copy_of_the_infamous_29_average_mat224)) agreed that the exam was fair.

I also think it would have been valuable to consult more math professors to provide a broader perspective on the situation. From my experience with Professor Mike Pawliuk during undergrad calculus, he was well-regarded for his fair exams and teaching approach by many students. A more balanced viewpoint might have painted a clearer picture.",comment,14

I’m in a bit of a conundrum. Basically, i found a ghost in the goldring student centre - but as far as I know, UofT has no ghost busting nor ghost hunting mechanisms or groups. What should I do? The folks at the Northrup Frye McDonald’s were extremely unhelpful when I spoke to them about this. 

Thanks for any help.

During my reporting, students told me that they faced difficulties like not having enough practice with in-person testing before the final exam, and not being informed of information they needed to memorize.

Professor Pawliuk also told me that students were likely struggling due to years of online schooling and having difficulty working together and supporting each other ever since.

I hear your concern, but I believe the piece addresses the relevant perspectives and information. Feel free to reach out to [maeveellis@thevarsity.ca](mailto:maeveellis@thevarsity.ca) with any other thoughts.

My time at the paper has helped me approach what I learn with an understanding that nothing is linear and everything is interdisciplinary. Everything and everyone at U of T are all interdependent and the paper helps me adapt that knowledge to my academics too.

Our team was thrust into the student encampment reporting cycle on our second day on the job in May. (Our team and I were on the field at 4 AM on May 2!)

What went right is how our News team was immediately on the ball and covering the [rapidly developing](https://thevarsity.ca/2024/05/23/breaking-the-encampment-must-end-u-of-t-gives-students-24-hours-to-accept-offer/) nature of the protest while maintaining important and [nuanced details of their demands](https://thevarsity.ca/2024/05/06/breaking-u-of-t-in-talks-with-protesters-as-students-feel-unheard-on-day-five-of-encampment/) against the university. Our Arts & Culture section and Business & Labour section also respectively covered the [different forms of cultural expression at the encampment  ](https://thevarsity.ca/2024/06/14/threads-of-resistance-weaving-culture-and-activism-at-u-of-ts-peoples-circle-of-palestine/)and the [breakdown of UofT’s investments](https://thevarsity.ca/2024/06/19/understanding-utams-investments-in-light-of-o4ps-divestment-report/) that protesters were addressing. 

We started with daily reporting and later wrote more periodically, and that’s something we have learned over time and what I believe we couldn’t have known earlier. 

Per your concern — it is true that we were not granted access to President Gertler’s press conference on May 23. We have been in talks with the university’s spokespeople about this in the summer. We are going to be publishing our interview with President Gertler in Issue 4, so look out for that piece!
