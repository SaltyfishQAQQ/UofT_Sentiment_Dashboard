Student randomly attacked near Rotman building last Thursday,soupertrooper5123,1ekho92,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ekho92/student_randomly_attacked_near_rotman_building/,1722842358.0,"I was walking along St. George St last Thursday afternoon/evening when I saw someone get attacked on the delivery road beside the Rotman Exchange building. A woman ran up from behind and struck the person repeatedly, they fought for a bit until the woman who attacked her left. There was yelling but couldn't make out what they were saying.

I saw this from across the street by Robarts library but I couldn't intervene because I was too far. I crossed to check the scene out and someone else was there with the victim, she was alright but clearly shaken up. I could overhear that the victim didn't know who the woman was, that it was completely random. Campus police came shortly after.

The attacker looked like 25-30 y/o, maybe older, wearing a white long sleeve with red text on it and black pants. She was black, with curly hair tied up in a bun with a medium build. 

Just spreading this as a warning to watch out for this woman who may be randomly attacking students on campus. It looked completely unprovoked and honestly really unsettling that this happened in broad daylight. 

Stay safe out there guys.",submission,96

The person who you're talking about sounds like a regular near Robarts and often shouts threats at people. Never thought she'd randomly attack someone though,comment,35

Most think these are mentally ill such as schizophrenia. Many keep giving them cash when they're begging. Mistaken kindness since they later get high. And it's extremely rare a schizophrenic is violent. It started with mental illness but this is, without a shadow of a doubt, about addiction. My guess is meth since it can cause psychosis in some which mimics schizophrenic hallucinations but with violent tendencies.

Meth is endemic here since it can be made at home with supplies from hardware stores and pharmacies (non-drowsy antihistamines which are kept behind the counter in the US). There are also cheap designer drugs on Toronto's streets which get imported from foreign labs, some similar to PCP (an anesthetic, delusional in high doses). There’s a new one becoming popular called Tranq, an animal tranquilizer often mixed with fentanyl.

The best approach is to walk at least 6 feet around them, do not stare and do not engage. I cross to the other side of a street or take a different path when someone is doing the meth or tranq zombie dance. A zombie running up from behind can’t be avoided of course.

How do they afford to get high and not work? They get paid at the end of every month, $733 for Ontario Works (OW), $1368 for Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP). About $400-$500 goes towards shelter but some homeless lie about having a place to live. The last cheque was the day before this assault, Wed, July31st. I heard one dose of meth is $10 in Toronto, addicts take drugs generally a few times a day.

I noticed there's a pattern – high daily the first week or two of the month before the money runs out. More sirens from ambulances and fire trucks beginning on the first of the month. More zombies and screamers. Then petty crime like stealing or stripping bikes mid to the end of the month to trade for cash and buy more drugs. Sometimes aggressively begging. More police interaction. Daylight trouble is more common since they need to check in to shelters early evening.

Campus police would contact TPS, Toronto Police Services where she would be well known. The unfortunate thing is it's catch and release, a day or two in jail or more likely, she's taken to a psych ward to detox and maintain bone fide meds, usually a week stay, rarely a month or two. Then these chronic street addicts are back on the streets to do it all again. We don't have any laws to force help for street addicts until they commit a crime or are not lucid enough to talk.

I saw one in the summer of 2022 who hung around the 7-Eleven at Bay and St. Joseph, calmly begging mornings then high afternoons yelling at people and banging things. The street addicts like hanging around the 24/7 convenience stores for begging, same as McD's. I heard he assaulted the 7-Eleven cashiers twice that summer. I saw him taken away at least 6 times by ambulance and police then he disappeared. Hopefully in time this woman will be committed for longer or accept the help she needs. Many refuse help, some even housing offers.

It’s not about housing alone since this has been a failure in US cities for street addicts. Toronto doesn’t have enough invested in psych ward beds. We would need to change some laws too like other cities who arrest the chronic troubled ones without a crime being committed. There are only about 3 or 4 dozen on the streets downtown but like this one woman, causing great grief to local residents.

This is not about targeting all homeless, the temporary, this is about targeting chronic homeless or housed addicts who cause trouble. There’s an old man who stays in bus shelters along Bay east of campus, he’s been in and out of housing and psych wards for 3 decades. I last saw him at Wellesley and Bay two months ago, he’ll cry that the city isn’t helping just to get more cash. He yells at some to go back to China. He was offered real housing in 2022 which he turned down.",comment,14

From behind and yelled F me when I look and I overtook me on the road. A lot of people seem aggressive for no reason.

Thanks for the info/tips. Scary times. I remember a decade ago most of the city, felt super safe in that area. No issues roaming around at 2-3 am. I wouldn't do so now. I'm spending another year in Toronto to finish up a Master's, but hopefully I'll have no incidents, whether on TTC or on campus.",comment,1
