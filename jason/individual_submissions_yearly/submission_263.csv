They seem to have no shame either! I‚Äôll admit I did go to school with sniffles when I was a child a few times but even then I was horribly insecure about every sound that emanated from me. I also did not understand basic things that should be obvious to an adult population such as the germ theory of disease. But apparently here at this glorious institution, as long as you don‚Äôt intend to infect people with your bad humours, they won‚Äôt get sick! You can just run your infinite viral particle generator of a respiratory system on ultra high mode while being off-putting to everyone else and go on about your day!

It‚Äôs especially silly considering how in many cases the lectures are recorded and in the rest some notes are usually posted. Besides, if a few days of lecture attendance is likely to make the difference between you passing and failing a course you may benefit from an honest conversation with yourself about your abilities and whether you‚Äôve bitten off more than you can chew. This just isn‚Äôt the same thing as the legitimate challenges that might come from having to take time off work if you don‚Äôt have the sick days for it or something like that.

And if your life somehow depends on sitting in a tightly-packed hall within spitting distance of dozens of people while you hack up a lung, please consider picking up some masks and ideally good ones like N95s or KN95s etc. They even come in black now if you‚Äôre insecure about the medical look (though you shouldn‚Äôt be!). Things have come a long way since 2020!

Also, last I checked you can still get free covid-19 rapid tests from shoppers drug marts, I personally have used the SDM in the Path outside of Union station to get them. Everything I say above applies to all illnesses but it‚Äôs fair to grade your level of caution based on what you know you have, so it‚Äôs still good to know if you have Covid and then isolate properly etc.

To end on a positive note, big thank you to everyone who does stay home when sick in spite of the personal costs of doing so - however minor - to themselves. You‚Äôve likely averted many lost days of productivity and well-being from other people by holding up your end of the social contract. Bravo!",submission,106

Nobody can predict the future. Probably there'll be better vaccines and treatments within 5-10 years.

We also impede the speed of progress when we spread it and give the virus more chances to mutate. Fewer people getting sick is never a bad thing.¬†

That said, the problem with COVID is that we don't always know when we're infectious. Studies show that as much as 40% of cases are asymptomatic but are still shedding the virus and capable of infecting others without people even knowing it.¬†


It's part of what makes COVID so much harder to avoid than most viruses.¬†The usual ""I'm not feeling well so I'll stay home"" isn't always there, so the virus can go out in public and propagate so much more effectively. Viruses that kill or severely sicken their hosts tend to be easier to control.


If I had a Plus Life device (high sensitivity at-home test machine that's near PCR accuracy) and was testing myself and my friends/family every few hours, that would be a different story cause then we'd know it's extremely unlikely any of us is contagious.¬†",comment,1
