i dont know if i can go back and ask the financial aid office for any more help since i already received 6k, any recommendations?",submission,21

reach out to your college registrar/financial aid person asap. emergency funding from the uni is one thing, college grants should be another? i personally qualified for a grant with my college (innis) after giving them a breakdown of my expenses. you should definitely go that route first! might be faster too! they'll also be able to see whether any other avenues are available. 

simultaneously, you could reach out to financial aid again to verify whether you got the full amount of emergency grants or if there's any leeway on that side, with your extenuating circumstances. 
could you also look for a job that's not work study? 500/month is very very low. i don't know if work study is a contract of some kind you can't get out of! 

i hope things work out for you— financial stress is so foul. let's hope there's better times on the horizon <3",comment,17
