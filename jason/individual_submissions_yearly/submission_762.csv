Has anyone received a physical acceptance letter?,KoolJobDescription,1cg7jmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cg7jmo/has_anyone_received_a_physical_acceptance_letter/,1714417867.0,"Last year I saw a blue envelope from UofT on my friend's refrigerator. It was an acceptance letter, and I remember thinking that I wanted to give one to my parents so they could put it on our fridge as well. That idea gave me a lot of motivation during a very difficult year. I was accepted two months ago and have been patiently waiting for a little blue envelope to appear in my letterbox. Unfortunately, the only mail I received from the university was a promotional magazine. Has anyone received a physical acceptance letter? Perhaps they are only being sent out to certain people in specific programs? I really want one...

EDIT: I just received the letter this morning! The envelope is a beautiful shade of blue with a little congratulatory note inside, and it's been placed proudly on my fridge! I recently accepted my offer, so maybe they send it to those who accept? Anyways, I'm just very happy rn. Tysm for all the insight and support!",submission,23

You can access your letter online. ig they don't want to print so many physical letters out, but idk. Maybe try emailing them to see if they're doing it this year.",comment,12
