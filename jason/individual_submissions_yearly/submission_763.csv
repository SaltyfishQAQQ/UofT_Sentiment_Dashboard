This is done at other universities I don’t see why uoft is an exception. There’s no reason other students should get more control over their gpa while some are just more unfortunate. We already have a limited number of credits we can CR NCR out 20 credits. Not sure how far it would work with program requirements but it can’t be impossible to implement somehow.,comment,13

These non-optional fees steal over $200 from each student over the course of their degree for services that don’t provide most people anything. I don’t see why student reps need to be paid salaries and why funding should be provided for election campaigns. 

This is a pretty big burden from a group that claims to prioritize student affordability. That is easily a month of groceries for many students. 

Over the last few years, the UTSU has always run a 1 million+ surplus according to their financial statements. Yet, they keep increasing fees from year to year.",comment,10
