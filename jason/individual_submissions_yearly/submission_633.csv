UofT login is getting worse day by day it won't stop,s-n-a-c-c,1gve9s2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gve9s2/uoft_login_is_getting_worse_day_by_day_it_wont/,1732067299.0,"I swear I have logged in 3 times today alone just to access quercus, including the ""is this your device?"" prompt. 

This is on the same device I have been using for the past five goddamn years at this university, their stupid system still has an issue detecting if this is my device THREE TIMES IN A DAY?? 

As if it's even worth it to log in, every assignment I submit some TA having a bad day decides that I should have just as bad of a day forcing me to penny pinch my grades for a pass.

Can't wait to get out of this dumpster fire.",submission,31
