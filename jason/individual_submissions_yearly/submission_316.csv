The province controls all four. 

1. Govt per student subsidy - Ontario has froze this for years and years pre mass inflation
2. Domestic Tuition - Ontario has froze since 10% cut in 2019. Tuition is now pretty cheap in real dollars. 
3. International tuition - not frozen, but fed cut number of spots. 
4. Donations and charitable giving - not frozen, but also not super easy to do. UofT does decently well but you can‚Äôt run a uni on it! Also very rarely donating to a general revenues bucket. Usually special specific things. 

1 and 2 have been so reduced that you can‚Äôt really operate a university on those anymore. Ford govt encouraged schools to aggressively pursue 3. When the public got mad, fed govt cut spots and Ford govt blamed schools for pursuing 3. 

Now, what‚Äôs left? 4! Which isn‚Äôt even that lucrative. UofT does well. but other Ontario schools? Danger zone. People just don‚Äôt give here at the scale that they do in the U.S.",comment,6

Remember we‚Äôre not talking about private for profit colleges here. We‚Äôre talking about the actual universities. And one of the best schools on the planet at that. 

The growth was warranted tbh. Enrolment numbers grew within a provcinically-mandated corridor (domestic) and through institutionally mandated % caps on total intl enrolment. 

If anything, a school like UofT is still not meeting demand. It could easily swallow up other Ontario schools if it lowered admission standards and let everyone who applied in. (See the link at the bottom of this post!) 

On managing balance sheets: they did, until the province fucked it up. Many unis had actually built up pretty solid reserves to 2019 (entirely off the backs of international student tuition, btw). But those were drawn down with the ongoing domestic tuition freeze beginning in 2019, inflationary pressure/ since 2022, interest rate challenges making debt harder to manage, and wage adjustments post Bill 124. 

All those macro economic factors making your life shittier? They‚Äôre hitting the universities too. And that‚Äôs bad news. Bc these entities make a lot of money for our economy, generate decent jobs across the province, and train the highly skilled workers who we very badly need to stay competitive. 

So, check out the Ford Government‚Äôs own report on exactly this topic. They make some recommendations that sort of align with what you‚Äôre saying (if we pretend you‚Äôre not just like‚Ä¶ranting out your ass) and some that will probably upset you. But reading is healthy and good! 

Unfortunately the govt didn‚Äôt like what their own personally appointed experts recommended, so they shelved it.

does that not subject them to running their institution in a way that creates a balance between quality of service and financial responsibility? so that the public can actually utilize a quality service

""If anything, a school like UofT is still not meeting demand. It could easily swallow up other Ontario schools if it lowered admission standards and let everyone who applied in. (See the link at the bottom of this post!)""

A university in one of the biggest cities in a first world country with significant employment opportunities has unsubstantiated enrolment demand, on regional privilege alone. That does not give them free reign to destroy local economies and support their business operations on tuition demand alone. Lets talk about the presidents recent bonuses.

""On managing balance sheets: they did, until the province fucked it up. Many unis had actually built up pretty solid reserves to 2019 (entirely off the backs of international student tuition, btw). But those were drawn down with the ongoing domestic tuition freeze beginning in 2019, inflationary pressure/ since 2022, interest rate challenges making debt harder to manage, and wage adjustments post Bill 124.""

So if we take a look at revenue by category . in 2018 government grants accounted for 28% of the universities revenue whereas in 2023 they accounted for 48% of their total revenue (despite the universities revenue rising by about 1.2 billion dollars and their FTE numbers increasing as well). And no, this was not off the backs of international students whose enrolment numbers at uoft have remained very steady YoY from 2014 to the current year, contrary to what you stated (as a percentage of total enrolment)

The only point i agree with of yours is that the school is facing growth pressure from macro conditions like inflation. Since their net income has remained flat at around 500 million from 2014 to 2023 (YoY) that money brings in deteriorating growth prospects.",comment,0
