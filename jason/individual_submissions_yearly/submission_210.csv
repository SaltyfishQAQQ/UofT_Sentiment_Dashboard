Robarts is a LIBRARY pls shut up and be QUIET: library rant,turkeyybaconn,1h5jcmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h5jcmm/robarts_is_a_library_pls_shut_up_and_be_quiet/,1733216690.0,"Iâ€™m SO INCREDIBLY FRUSTRATED AT HOW LOUD PEOPLE ARE AT ROBARTS 

like for what reason are people fully chatting and laughing loudly and hanging out in large groups at the tables in the main library. Especially the upper floors which are QUIET FLOORS. Itâ€™s actually ridiculous how many people are so insensitive and ignorant to their surroundings, if you want to talk to ur friends and hang out- GO SOMEWHERE ELSE. Itâ€™s so unacceptable that people are walking around taking phone calls or watching videos at full blast volume and just fooling around causing a ruckus. For the love of god have some respect, people like me go to Robarts for the quiet working environment of a library, did yall parents not teach you ANYTHINGGGGGG 
I swear Iâ€™ve seen toddlers better behaved in a library compared to these people. 

Itâ€™s insane that these groups (who are always coincidentally very youngâ€¦ like first and second year studentsâ€¦) have no EQ or any understanding of social cues in a library to keep quiet. Everyone else is silent and working.. why do these groups feel that itâ€™s ok to speak at full volumes as if theyâ€™re the only ones there????? Are yall not embarrassed??????? Itâ€™s actually baffling how people have full conversation with each other while completely ignoring the fact that theyâ€™re being extremely rude and distracting. (This specific genre of people infuriate and disgust me so much Iâ€™ve started calling them the Robarts Rats lol)

Robarts is a LIBRARY not a social club. I repeat, Robarts is a LIBRARY!!!!!!!! if youâ€™re going to be there please respect the other people there and keep quiet. There are literally signs all around the building saying to be quiet. If you rlly wna chitchat that badly then donâ€™t go to the library and bother people who are there fighting for their academic lives. Either do us all a favour and learn to shut tf up, or do yourself a favour and go back to elementary school to relearn how to properly behave in public. 

Anyways. I digress. Good luck on finals to everyone except for the Robarts rats.

Just approach those kids with a neutral tone and be respectful about it and chances are they will apologize and tone it down or even leave. I have done it before a few times and Iâ€™m generally not the most confrontational person unless when necessary. 

Iâ€™m sorry but itâ€™s getting annoying. You need to talk to them or else they will continue to do it, this isnâ€™t the only social cue people seem to miss because they didnâ€™t miss it actually just like flushing the toilet or not creating a mess on washrooms, they simply donâ€™t care enough until someone catches them red handed and rebukes them for it.",comment,41

I had my headphones on and I could still hear them. Should have went up to them but I was nearly done my assignment anyway and didn't want the hassle of starting a fight potentially.,comment,9

Also, I have confronted these people (and still do when I need to). If confrontation solved this problem I wouldnâ€™t have had to rant about it here lol. In fact thatâ€™s another reason why this is so frustrating- even after I ask them to tone it down âœ¨they continue to be loudâœ¨
