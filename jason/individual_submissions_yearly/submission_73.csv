I think your statement that students should stay out of class when sick because it‚Äôs a threat to you, or others, is incredibly hypocritical. Your aversion to answering my question goes to the heart of what I think is hypocritical: you‚Äôre asking students to stay home for your benefit because you acknowledge the harm that illness causes, yet you ostensibly deny students any clemency for that illness and expect them to figure out any missed instructional/study time on their own.

And that‚Äôs why students are going to always come into your class sick. If they‚Äôre not given any clemency for being ill then why would they also willingly lose money for a class they paid and lose instructional time they can never make up? The opportunity cost makes no sense.",comment,0

Students should stay at home when sick, that‚Äôs a fact. Disagree with all you want, it is a long established fact. I don‚Äôt directly answer your question because as you know, the discretion on attendance is up to the instructor. University policy requires students to provide a sick letter.

Every course is different so yes, I can‚Äôt directly answer your question about make-up time as I don‚Äôt know what the coursework is. 

You are grasping at straws here when saying I don‚Äôt believe students deserve clemency. As I have said before, it is up to the student and course instructor to decide what appropriate amount of works look like for students who are ill. That could take in the form of extensions or reducing deliverables. You are clearly speaking in hypotheticals, which you have little knowledge of.

I speak in hypotheticals that are grounded in the reality that students face when they miss class - whether that be due to illness or some other life circumstance. When students miss class, the burden is on them to make up for the missed content/instructional time. 

An international student is likely paying in excess of $200 per class in your course. And they‚Äôre supposed to just rely on being treated kindly for choosing to stay home because you, the prof, tell them to stay home? Yet you, when asked anonymously, you can‚Äôt explain what sort of *actual* clemency you provide students in these situations? No. You speak in uncertainties and defer to generic policy. 

Maintain your position all you want, but when this conversation is abstracted against the backdrop of your entire tone in this thread, it should come as no surprise to understand why students come to class sick.

Generalities exist until you define a scope. You can‚Äôt vaguely argue for the benefit of students when you yourself don‚Äôt define what type of student you are referring to. You vaguely mention international students and the price they pay per class, which, I might add is foolhardy as program cost vary greatly across degree types. If a student has to stay home due to illness, it is up to the student and instructor together to find a solution. I fail to understand how that is not fair. Each course has a clear set of deliverables that are required to be completed by the student for successful completion of the course. If a student is unable to meet the deliverables, it is a discussion with the instructor on what the next steps would be.

As I have mentioned before, which you so graciously ignored, clemency for absentee students due to sickness can be a whole host of items. It can be a reduction in deliverables to additional time provided to the student. 

Might I add, rarely do seasonal flu become debilitating enough for a student to become at risk of failing. A class or week loss of content is by far no issue when generally courses are 12-14 weeks long (depending again on program).

If you claim to be a defender of students, be helpful and be specific. There are many resources the University provides for students for accessibility including sickness.",comment,1
