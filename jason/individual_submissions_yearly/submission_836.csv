I really wanted to apply there in the near future, but apparently they are only accepting domestic applicants. Is this specific to this year or is it a common thing to happen?",submission,16

Itâ€™s because the supervisor and/or department have to pay the international studentâ€™s tuition fees to the university, which is extremely expensive, and the return on investment (the research the student will produce) is too low for a masters student. Most programs only accept international PhDs.",comment,83

This cost gets passed down to the Faculty level and then down to the departmental level.   In FAS, departments have a quota of how many international students they can have at any given time.  If they're at quota they can't take a new one in until a current one graduates.  (Assuming that they're hoping to get some funding from the dean's office to help support that grad student.)  This has to do with non-professional programs that provide funding to students.

If you need to be in the GTA, have a look at York, TMU, Waterloo, Guelph, McMaster?  And, obviously, there are great Canadian universities outside of Ontario...  FWiW, everyone at the UofT is frustrated about the situation. :|",comment,12

It was actually already a surprise to me that masters programs in Canada are cheap and sometimes funded (as opposed to US or UK masters), so it makes sense that not all departments can guarantee funding.
