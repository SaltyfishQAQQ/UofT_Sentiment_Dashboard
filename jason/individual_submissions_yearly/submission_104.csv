was looking for clubs to join and came across ""Falun Dafa Practice and Study Group at U of T"" [https://sop.utoronto.ca/group/falun-dafa-practice-and-study-group-at-u-of-t/](https://sop.utoronto.ca/group/falun-dafa-practice-and-study-group-at-u-of-t/) 

From my understanding this is some sort of chinese cult with anti chinese communist party origins. digging further there is a few reputable western news agencies reporting on their misdeeds like:

epoch times, a news agency setup by falun gong to spread conspiracy: [https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epoch-times-falun-gong-growth-rcna111373](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/epoch-times-falun-gong-growth-rcna111373)

abuse of performers in ShenYun a cultural performance arm of Falungong:  
[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/nyregion/shen-yun-nyt-investigation.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/16/nyregion/shen-yun-nyt-investigation.html)

testimony of cult traits:  
[https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/inside-falun-gong-master-li-hongzhi-the-mountain-dragon-springs/12442518](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-07-21/inside-falun-gong-master-li-hongzhi-the-mountain-dragon-springs/12442518)

  
do not use [https://www.removepaywall.com/](https://www.removepaywall.com/) to remove paywall it is illegal and bad.

Note I am not condemning anti Chinese communist movements, but rather i am expressing my view that an organisation which advocates against proper healthcare, abuse of members and running conspiracy news  should not be approved as an official school club.

I am considering writing to the school about revoking their club status and would like to see if my sentiments are legit or im just being delulu? ",submission,209

I have been approached several times by some people practicing that cult at College/Queen's Park and University. Even if I ignore their BS, they still won't leave me alone with their ""stuff"" and would still follow me to the other side.

""A San Francisco man named Samuel Luo has claimed that his mother and stepfather refused essential medical treatment because of Falun Gong’s teachings that sickness is based in karma; he has also claimed that they came to believe that it was the gods’ plan to eliminate the gay population.""

Crazy stuff. They also run Shen Yun, which is advertised as a dance performance, but in reality serves as propaganda for their beliefs.

If you take medicine, it means you lack faith in Falun Gong, you fail the spiritual test, and you don't eliminate your karma. The practice requires that followers eliminate attachments and interference, which leads them to prioritize Falun Gong over other crucial aspects of their life. In addition, believers usually spend 2-3 hours on the exercises, 1 hour on spiritual study (""Fa-study""), 1 hour on ""sending forth righteous thoughts"", and unlimited time for ""clarifying the truth"" every day. In order to support projects that ""clarify the truth"", a lot of money and time is dedicated to them.

Falun Gong is not truly a practice where people are ""free to come and go"", because mental pressure prevents believers from having critical thinking. According to Falun Gong, its believers have signed an oath to Falun Dafa to save the world's beings. The founder of Falun Gong said, ""When you first stepped into Dafa, you had already used your life to sign a contract. No matter how old or young you were, or how much time has passed, making a vow is serious."" He told believers that they would enter hell if they quit: ""\[As\] soon as he loses the Fa, do you know what he faces? It’s really horrific, because when he fails to fulfill the major responsibilities and the huge missions that were bestowed upon him ... and he will truly have to enter the gate of no-life."" (The gate of no-life is a place where beings who have committed huge sins suffer forever.) According to the Falun Gong founder, the universe will soon enter a period called the Fa-rectification (the old universe is destroyed, and a new one is created). Evil beings will be eliminated, leaving only those who support Falun Gong. Since leaving Falun Gong is a sin, the former believers will not survive the destruction of the universe. ""Let me tell you, when this Fa-rectification matter is over, humankind will enter the next stage, and those people and beings who in their minds think that the cosmos’s Dafa isn’t good will be the first weeded out. It’s because no matter how bad some beings in the cosmos are, these ones are even worse, for what they are against is the Way of the cosmos.""

The result is that most people don't take medicine.

In ""Falun Gong"", it is written: ""Taking medication during cultivation implies that you do not believe in the disease-curing effects of cultivation. If you believed in it, why would you take medication?""

And in ""Fa Teaching Given in New York City,"" it is written: ""'Of course a person needs to take medicine when he gets sick.' 'Of course a person needs to go to the hospital for treatment when he gets sick.' This is how people deal with this, and it isn’t wrong. But as a cultivator you can’t confuse yourself with an everyday person. To put it a bit seriously, you’re no longer human.""",comment,1

I know what's wrong with the Falun Gong, and you're too blind to see it. It ain't perfect. In fact it's far from perfect.

You think you know everything. You think everything that Falun Gong cult group believes is correct. Well let me break it to you straight: you thought it wrong. BIG TIME. Again, you can think you and Falun Gong are ""perfect and correct"" all you want, but the fact is: you guys are NOT correct and perfect, and FAR FROM THEM.

The FG has become what they set out to stop, a organisation that oppresses and brainwashes its members.

Have you read about the much more serious allegations against China?

What’s the worst in the articles shared about FG? Alleging they spread conspiracies and have “cult traits”? That’s it??? One story ain’t some performer abuse? That’s the only incident you can find?

Well there’s 100s of worse articles about China itself. Happy to show you them if you need help but just google it.

So the question is, why are you trying to cancel and silence a group that you could only find those articles for (so not much wrong)? Just because they are critical to China?

Also what you’re saying is not well sourced in reputable publications!

For those who have benefited know what you have quoted from the books is not really that important. What matter is how you have practiced it. And, it's also ok to seek medical treatments. Nobody including Teacher Li forces anything. If you fall, you get up. And we don't go extreme ways.",comment,0

They fail; some people don't go back, and some do. That's why they are called ""practitioners."" We don't need to seek medical treatments if our health is excellent after they fail once, twice, or many times.

If your health recovers, you can return to practice. There is nothing wrong with that. You guys make too big a deal out of it.

If Falun Gong FORCES one not to take medicine or seek medical treatments, I would say it's a cult. But Falun Gong does not force anyone. If your mindset is not that of a true practitioner, you MUST take medicine. You do not understand how this works. There will be a few people who do not follow the guidelines of Falun Gong. You cannot blame Falun Gong for that. The majority of Falun Gong practitioners enjoy their well-being and health.
