Second year astrophysics student at utsc. I have  friends group but certain people in the group don't want me there. So the social aspect is not great. My grades suck, but passing, had to drop a couple of courses tho. A lot of pressure from parents to get a high GPA. Lost motivation to do well from not getting having rewarded for what good I have done in school. Been sleeping a lot to escape. 

What resources are there to help me get motivated? Also how do I get my friend group to accept me?",submission,36

I had (and still do) have the same sorta pessimism when it comes to life circumstances.

Whenever I really needed help- the Health and Wellness centre helped a lot. They’re dogshit a lotta the time- but their counsellors are super nice. I was even given a student therapist to see weekly which helped with my anxiety tremendously. Since it’s all through the school, it’s completely free of charge (provided you did no opt out of the schools insurance. Slowly but surely they’ve helped me access resources that I’m super grateful for now looking back. The Accessibility team was also super helpful in getting me accommodations for my depression + other issues. 

As for GPA- there’s this program called “ArriveUTSC” that goes on every semester I believe. It way more popular than you’d think! Basically they use a lecture hall and focus on developing study skills and habits most beneficial to the university environment. I’ve heard it’s very useful and really helps bring up grades. 

best of luck! know it does get easier <3",comment,1

(Obv biased because im Christian myself) I have met people from the club UTSC ACF (asian christian fellowship) and they are great people, and you also dont have to be asian or christian to go check it out! Some of my best UofT friends are from christian fellowships, so that would be my personal advice, but the other comments are also good ideas! Good luck with everything and I will pray for you",comment,1

We don't implement and force friendships  .If they don't want you in the friend groups leave it. You will find the people who value your presence and deserve your time and friendship,comment,1

that literally could be part of the problem. Go for walks, take care of yourself more. It's mind blowing how much of the physical is related to the mental and vice versa.",comment,11

Friendships should be a safe haven, not a source of stress.My advice would be, Don’t waste time mending ties that no longer bind; instead, weave new bonds with those who uplift you.
Anyways, best of luck with your studies. I hope the things get better for you soon  <3",comment,3
