Even if the answer is wrong on the test make sure you write the correct steps to answer the questions and you will get most points even if the actual answer is wrong. 
So if you are doing the homework correctly but getting the incorrect answers that is fine cause you just go back through the steps. 

The tests are pretty forgiving if you show all your work and make it make sense. Good luck I remember this frustration but you can do it.",comment,5

He follows the same syllabus or material that is covered in MAT135. He shows each and every step and teaches as if the viewer is new to the concepts. He follows Stewart calculus textbook closely and does the red marked questions in the book as examples and some other questions as well that are easier to understand. Also fun fact he looks like clark kent ðŸ˜‚. When I took the course at uoft there werenâ€™t many examples done in the class so I wasnâ€™t clear on the application of the concepts so I started watching him and preferred him over my prof. Also if you just watch his videos and understand the concepts and how he solves the examples trust me you will easily be able to get A in the course. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF797E961509B4EB5&si=nJOEYl-BbIQmexkX,comment,3

Because the concepts of derivatives are new to people in calc 1, it is therefore difficult. It doesnâ€™t matter if people are adjusting to university or not, new content is inherently harder. Thus, by virtue of calc 3 building upon lots of familiar material, it is in that way less foreign and by extension a more manageable experience.

As well, I donâ€™t need to have an unbiased nationwide poll in order to think my opinion has some validity; you also have a clear opinion on this matter and I highly doubt you are led by some large-scale unbiased poll. Grow up.

I didnâ€™t take mat135/136 or mat235, I took the math spec equivalents. And from my experience taking those equivalents, I did find the computations in mat257 much more easy to get ahold of than the computations in mat157, mainly because I had that prior experience to build off of.",comment,1
