sta257 term test distribution contrast to sta237 ,ObliviousX2,1d5923v,https://i.redd.it/95qcs1mihu3d1.jpeg,1717197402.0,"Given the recent sta237 grade distribution post, I'd thought it be interesting to share the midterm for sta257, worth 24%. The contrast is kinda crazy ngl. Hopefully we don't get smited on the final",submission,30

HOW DARE STUDENTS KEEP UP WITH MATERIAL FROM LECTURE AND PERFORM WELL. Letâ€™s add more curveballs and difficult questions on the next timed exam.",comment,7

Secondly courses in the math and stats department regularly have C or C- averages and it seems deliberate since typically if the class does well on a midterm the next test tends to be more difficult, this is by definition manipulation. I donâ€™t understand how it would be reasonable for a class to be getting >B averages on assignments and exams to suddenly a ~D average on a final, which is common. 

Lastly, increasing the proportion of niche/esoteric concepts or making problems more difficult than those covered in class creates dispersion that is often a result of students ability to problem solve under pressure and not necessarily how well they  absorbed the core content covered and focussed on in lecture.",comment,4

If one had the same level of understanding of the course content as them, one would score equally well; the grading remains fair. 

If not a single student is able to do well, then indeed there is a problem. And that's maybe just because the prof wants students to try their best and get a curve going in the end.",comment,-2

In an ideal world, professors should honestly be blind to the outcome of the exams and just try to keep their exam content as consistent as possible across time, if one year the class has a B average then so be it.

I guess this could be difficult as students have access to past exams and itâ€™s a lot to ask to come up with new exams that are of the same difficulty.",comment,3
