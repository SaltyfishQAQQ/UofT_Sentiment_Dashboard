how can I get help for my eating disorder from uoft,kmrbuky,lo5wlgh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fls0jy/how_can_i_get_help_for_my_eating_disorder_from/lo5wlgh/,1726893775.0,"Hello. I'm an alumni who also struggles with disordered eating and was diagnosed in university. I would normally DM someone about this but I am writing this comment publicly in hopes it'll help others, and for archival purposes.

I am not sure if your international student status will change anything coverage-wise (I am a Canadian citizen), but:

-UofT has mental health services equipped with psychiatrists. I am not sure if they had counsellors/therapists (a psychiatrist is a registered doctor who can prescribe medication, a counsellor cannot). The process to onboard is quite long and accessibility is not the best, but it may be your best/only option. FWIW, I had a really lovely psychiatrist at UofT, but people seem split on who provides better emotional support (...it's usually the counsellor).

-EDs are a polarizing topic on every level, which is to say that **not every general counsellor accepts ED patients,** if only because they do not feel that they can readily assist with the intricacies of EDs (although many parts do intersect with general counselling). If possible, I suggest you look for treatment options with specialized counsellors in this field.

-Although I have not used them myself, [NEDIC (National Eating Disorder Information Centre)](https://nedic.ca/) will be your best choice, and they will have the best resources/options for someone living in Toronto. I have also heard of [Sheena's Place](https://sheenasplace.org/), though again, I have not used their resources myself.

* If you are in Vancouver like me, you can receive help from the Foundry (if you are under 25 years old) or the Looking Glass Foundation.

Lastly, I just wanted to say that I empathize and I hope that NEDIC will be able to find some support for you. Food encompasses every part of our lives—we engage with it constantly. Having food run your life is tough and I always joke that even if I get into medical school, nothing will have been harder than going through an ED. But if you find good support and good counselling, it will be a tough but enlightening process, and I hope you will find some peace and self-acceptance with the right assistance.

As someone who respects medicine and works in the medical field, I unfortunately have not found that our physicians today are well-equipped to discuss and treat disordered eating, so my personal recommendation is to find a registered counsellor who specializes it instead. UofT also has (had?) dieticians when I attended from 2016-2021, but I thought they were completely counterintuitive to the type of support I needed and I would stay away unless something has changed.",comment,20

You can schedule an appointment by calling them or use their drop in mental health counselling. I haven’t gone for an ed, but I found the mental health counseling really helpful. I think there are other services (psychiatrists and other types of doctors) that you can explore as well. This student healthcare is covered by the incidental fees of your tuition.",comment,3

If you don’t know where to start, and you haven’t been to a doctor here, they can give you guidance step by step and will send you info of UofT’s resources. However, the replies here are accurate - make an appointment with health and wellness or with a family doctor at UofT. They will assess your situation and assign you someone who can help. They usually also connect you with a dietitian. Someone mentioned Sheena’s Place - they are (or were!) usually full, but they do give you this reference as well. They also offer group sessions, but access to these is a bit limited and will depend on availability as well as other conditions. Contact them soon! And don’t be afraid of asking for help to your department or your counselor.",comment,1
