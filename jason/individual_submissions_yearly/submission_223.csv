But back when I was in 5th grade, I had learned that Albert Einstein's favourite philosopher was Immanuel Kant. Ever since then, I have been a little bit obsessed with Kant, hoping to one day read his Critique of Pure Reason. Imma do it eventually. This is just like my realization a while back that, as a fully grown adult, I don't need anyone's permission to buy myself a giant chainsaw.",submission,122

For free.

If you‚Äôre going into it thinking it‚Äôs an easily digestible read, you‚Äôre going to be in for a frustrating time. The book is not very accessible to beginners to Kant/Modern philosophy, and was purposely written that way. You need a very good understanding of the philosophical terminology of the day and also a good understanding of rationalism and empiricism theory.",comment,24
