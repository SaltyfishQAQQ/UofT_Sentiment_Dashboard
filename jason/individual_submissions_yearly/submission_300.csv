I actually studied CS at uWaterloo (class of 2022) but I figured you guys might find this useful over here.

Last year I got fed up with the feeling of despair I would get whenever I used LinkedIn to find jobs, so I decided to build something better.

[https://techjobs.xyz](https://techjobs.xyz)  
  
Every day I scrape the career pages of 20k+ top tech companies (for example, google.com/careers), and then send all the data through GPT to be categorized by salary, location, etc.

The result is this nice and simple job board which is way more comprehensive than the other sites I've seen.

The reason for this post: I recently added filtering for internships, and with the upcoming summer 2025 recruitment season around the corner, I thought you guys might find it useful. 

To filter for internships, click on ""Advanced Filters"" and then select ""intern"" in the seniorities menu.

The site is free, but I charge for a few minor features (like seeing H1-B sponsorships) in order to cover my crazy GPT bills. But as students. I don't think you will need that, so please don't pay anything. The internship filtering stuff is completely free :) 

Please give it a go at [https://techjobs.xyz](https://techjobs.xyz), and let me know if you have any feedback -- I'd love to improve the site. Thanks!

That looks good. I would say mine is a bit better in terms of UX: on levels.fyi you can only select software engineer, and the country. On mine you can set some super fine grained filters (tech stack, seniority, exact location, etc). But theirs is definitely useful as well",comment,1
