I worked in community pharmacy before and after Covid and the wages in the GTA relative to the responsibilities are not worth it, a lot of international pharmacy graduates and competition in the GTA driving down wages. I work in hospital in Alberta now, great pay, great hours and work life balance, less stress, and greater job satisfaction. It’s also nice having the greatest scope of practice in Canada!

I wouldn’t recommend pharmacy in the GTA, but my experience outside of that has been pretty great.",comment,20

Retail work is stressful and most of the time you only have one support person. Sure pay is decent but the work environment is trash. Patients give you hard time for everything and head office breathes down on your neck to make sure you meet their scummy quotas for half-assed clinical services. Imagine doing clinical work at the pace of Mcdonalds, thats how it is in retail. Phones ringing ever so often. Some doctors are nice while others act as assholes when you question a prescription they wrote for some clarity or out of concern for the patient. Expect to be overworked and underappreciated once you enter the field. Make sure you really want to do pharmacy, otherwise you will have a decent amount of debt, unless your family helps you out. To compact 4 years of content into 3 doesn't exactly mean its good. You might have to do your rotations every weekend while studying and have more content to cover per year.",comment,8

At least here in BC and Alberta. There is a big shortage and you can easily get a job pretty much anywhere. The wage has been going up a lot because of this. I know a lot of people who complain about pharmacy is mainly about community pharmacy. Sometimes you have to deal with ungrateful and rude patients such is the nature of a customer service job. If you work in hospital or an online pharmacy you can save the drama of dealing with customers face to face.,comment,4

I have another friend who works in Florida and he has just built a huge farm house from scratch for himself -  it’s his second house.
