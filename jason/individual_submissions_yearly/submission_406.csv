UofT's admissions + advertising was hard at work recruiting them, and while some of the positive aspects they advertise are true, obviously UofT doesn't want to advertise the tough/negative aspects of the school to them. For example I think it goes without saying that UofT does a pretty poor job of listening to students' concerns about mental health. ",submission,59

You need an extension? Ask in advance or speak to your registrar. You fight (advocate) when they say no.

Suspect you have a disability? Pursue registering for Accessibility Services.

Need to improve your job chances? Access career services at your college and network.

Simply ask for help. I have spoken to folks left and right who needed a push to use every single academic accommodation that they could access but weren’t confident.",comment,70

I hate these Fkn midterms that never end on top of annoying homeworks. The workload and grades attached etc. made me lose my passion for something I once really enjoyed doing.

Studying hard is not the only way to get high gpa.

also, i'm only 3 months in, yet my goals/aspirations have (slightly) changed, so i wouldn't go into the mindset of planning your life 5 years ahead. use this time to explore things outside of your comfort zone.",comment,5

edit: a lot of people i know started with a full course load and then ended up taking an extra year because they struggled with 5+ courses per semester; it's totally okay to take less than 5.0 FCE per regular academic year, it's just a matter of whether it's financially viable for you. i took summer courses in 2021 and this year to help me finish my degree while taking a reduced course load, and i benefited a lot from having more time to get things done, not only physically and mentally but also academically",comment,2

Learn what options are available and USE THEM. If you’re unsure that something is possible, ask and advocate for it.

I always always tell my students - if you need help or you have a problem or are struggling, TELL ME and 99% of the time we can work out a solution, like an extension, or an alternate assignment, or a redo. I’ve had students who have not submitted any assignments due to mental health reasons and we were able to come up with an alternate plan and they passed the course with a decent mark. But you have to be willing to speak up - most of the time students are too embarrassed or they convince themself something isn’t possible and just take the L. Don’t do that!!
