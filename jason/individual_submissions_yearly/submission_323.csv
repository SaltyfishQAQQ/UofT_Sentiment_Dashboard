Subject: Message about freedom of expression and protest 

Text:
‚ÄúDear students,

At this time of heightened tensions, when protests are taking place on many university campuses, I am writing to remind you of the University of Toronto‚Äôs commitment to free expression and lawful and peaceful protest, as well as the necessary limits that accompany those freedoms.

Freedom of expression is central to the University of Toronto‚Äôs mission of learning and discovery. The University‚Äôs Statement on Freedom of Speech notes that ‚Äúall members of the University must have as a prerequisite freedom of speech and expression, which means the right to examine, question, investigate, speculate, and comment on any issue without reference to prescribed doctrine, as well as the right to criticize the University and society at large.‚Äù The statement also makes clear that all members of our community have the freedom ‚Äúto engage in peaceful assemblies and demonstrations.‚Äù

The University respects our members‚Äô rights to assemble and protest within the limits of U of T policies and the law. The University also has a duty of care to our students. Actions that create a health and safety risk, that interfere with the ability of students, faculty, librarians and staff to learn, teach, research and work on our campuses, or that disrupt or impede other University activities are not permitted. 

U of T‚Äôs lands and buildings are private property, though the University allows wide public access to them for authorized activities. Unauthorized activities such as encampments or the occupation of University buildings are considered trespassing. Specifically, our Code of Student Conduct prohibits intentional damage to University property, unauthorized entry and use of University property contrary to instructions, disruptions of University activities, and other offenses to property and persons.

Any student involved in unauthorized activities or conduct that contravenes University policies or the law may be subject to consequences. We ask that you engage productively with one another to fulfill our mutual obligation to provide a welcoming and safe community in which all members can express themselves.

Best Regards,

Professor Sandy Welsh

Edit: I'll repost my email reply here.

Hello,

Most of the students who are paying attention to what is happening were expecting this email. This is a thinly-veiled threat against your pupils and a weaponisation of the mass land ownership the University of Toronto holds in the downtown core of the city, which directly contradicts the many land acknowledgments the university has platformed in the name of Indigenous recognisation. 

I come from an Egyptian family that was forced to flee Lebanon in 1975 due to Israeli military aggression. You house Hillel - an organisation known for their IDF recruitment, promotion of birthright trips that directly contribute to settler colonisation, and that generally pushes a conservative Zionist agenda - in the Wolfond Centre for Jewish Campus Life building on the corner of Harbord and Huron. A literal Zionist organisation known for actively espousing Islamophobic and apartheid rhetoric while spreading their own anti-Semitism against anti-Zionist Jews has THEIR OWN BUILDING ON CAMPUS. An organisation perpetuating Israeli occupation and oppression is OK, but you‚Äôre warning students against camping on grounds they help finance?

Not only that, but when, at the beginning of this month, pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied President Gertler‚Äôs office and an agreement was made to engage in discussions; the meeting was revealed to be unproductive and ill-intentioned on behalf of the university. President Gertler showed his ignorance and incompetence in dealing with the situation, repeatedly conflating Arabs and Muslims, misunderstanding the history of the conflict, and lying about the lack of support for Palestine on campus. Perhaps he doesn‚Äôt walk the grounds often, but I have consistently seen keffiyehs worn by many different kinds of people. It was also revealed during this meeting that the university initiated their own meeting with Israeli students to support them, meanwhile it took six months of attempted communication with the President‚Äôs office (all of which were ignored) and an encampment to be heard. The double standard outlined here and the hypocrisy of promoting free speech and the right to assembly, yet extending a warning in the same breath, perfectly encapsulates the power imbalance and how deeply entrenched colonialism of all kinds, not just Zionism, is in these institutions.

You cannot teach postcolonialism and promote courses with content from the likes of James Baldwin, Edward Said, and Frantz Fanon, and expect your students to refrain from enacting their learnings in the face of extreme injustice. I believe your responses to Simcoe Hall and now the mass protests across North America have only exponentiated the fuel required for encampments to begin.

I will be heavily considering my decision to continue studies at the university unless divestments from war-fuelling funds are expedited.

Sincerely,",comment,103

We're not talking about the Jewish right to return. We're talking about the settler colonial project that is Zionism. Zionists absolutely have no right to expel other indigenous peoples to set up their ethnoreligious apartheid regime.

As well, religion has no place in dictating what land belongs to who. Allah isn‚Äôt real. Yahweh isn‚Äôt real. God isn‚Äôt real. Your belief system does not dictate reality. Jews should be able to return to their homeland if they wish to, and Muslims, Jews and Christians should all be able to live in a harmonious single-state. Israelis have no right to an ethnoreligious state that dictates they are the sovereign rulers of the land ‚Äúpromised to them‚Äù, which is what modern Israel is.

Let us remember that indigenous is a word used here in North America that is all-encompassing of native tribes and that they were not a contiguous group of peoples. That applies to other indigenous groups as well. For example, I am a Coptic Egyptian, but recognise that Siwan Berbers are also indigenous to Egypt. Hope this helps!

The situation escalated into a full-blown war in 1948, with the end of the British Mandate and the departure of British forces, the declaration of independence of the State of Israel and the entry of neighbouring Arab armies. The newly established Israeli forces launched a major offensive. The result of the war was the permanent displacement of more than half of the Palestinian population.

Palestine as a name predates the Roman Republic, let alone the Empire. There are traces of the Palestine name as far back as 2000BCE. Your arguments are based in plain ignorance and racism dude.

Oh, so you're just intentionally instigatory and racist. Hopefully you're not a math or CS major, using algorithms and numbers all taken from the Islamic world! Start here for your first lesson: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_Golden_Age

I attended an event hosted in Robarts a couple of months ago and U of T asked me to sign a consent form to be filmed and photographed. I've also previously consented to be photographed in a classroom.

Is it okay to film students studying on the 12th floor of Robarts without their consent? Do they have a greater expectation of privacy compared to students sitting in the Vic Quad?
