1. didn't attend the hearing
2. didn't show character
3. didn't present evidence for extenuating circumstances
4. , and repeated the offence once prior and twice in the same period

The tribunal judges based on ""a. The character of the person charged;

b. The likelihood of a repetition of the offence;

c. The nature of the offence committed;

d. Any extenuating circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence;

e. The detriment to the University occasioned by the offence; and

f.The need to deter others from committing a similar offence.""

Based on this, the student was charged the maximum penalty of expulsion noting the fact that the student admitted guilt on numerous occasions. It reached a point where she called in an immigration advisor to speak for her.

assumptions: She very likely just left Canada and is probably studying somewhere else now. considering how the courses she got caught for were likely in first/second year (STA256H5 ECO202Y5) the re-start very likely had little impact in the grand scheme of things and the restart would essentially expunge her record outside of Canada.",comment,7
