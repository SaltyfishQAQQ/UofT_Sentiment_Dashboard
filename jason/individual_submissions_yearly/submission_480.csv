You have something called UofT Time which is basically classes start 10 mins later than the time provided on the schedule (in my example this means you need to reach your second class by 3:10PM).

  
Also you can leave, enter, eat, drink etc,. whenever you want in class. Obviously, mind your manners if you skipped lunch and have to eat during lecture, sit in the back and try not to disturb the class. What I'm trying to say is that you do as you wish -- if you need to go to the washroom -- just go, no need to ask anyone (the prof will probably be upset you disrupted the class for a silly question lol). This also means you can leave a couple minutes earlier to ensure you reach the other class on time (I'd suggest making a friend who can share any notes you may miss in the final minutes of lecture).",comment,20

The worksheet requires you to sign your name at the top. 

They are submitted for grading — that is equivalent to having attendance. If you don’t show up, you will get a 0 for the worksheet. Again, not enforced, you can skip if you wish to do so but you’ll lose the marks. 

Attendance is never a roll call, that wastes too much time. In a 50min class you don’t want to waste another 10mins making sure everyone is present. If they don’t come, they lose marks - simple.

If you are referring to whether lectures are recorded, it varies depending on the professor. They will usually let you know at the start (in syllabus or asked on first day) usually this is a database of online lectures done through covid. But in most CS classes they have live recordings (ie recordings of each session present time, not old ones). But this should always be a final resort, the content may remain same but the focus on exams may change. 

And finally, yes you have to register for a tutorial. Its separate. If all availabilities conflict then you have an issue and should have not enrolled in the course/planned the schedule. If its too late now, try emailing registrar and see if they can help..",comment,1
