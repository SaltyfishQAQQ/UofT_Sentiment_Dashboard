The duality of Bahen washrooms | my Yin and Yang ,Bernardos_Pupil,1ft1mqv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ft1mqv/the_duality_of_bahen_washrooms_my_yin_and_yang/,1727718147.0,"The only washroom I used for the past 3 weeks has been the one at Myhal so this experience has been a huge accomplishment for my character. I started using the washroom located on the 2nd floor at Bahen but it never has soap in the dispensers. So I have to walk up to the third floor where the soap dispensers are working. But the thing is, the paper towel dispenser is empty on the third floor - so I have to walk down to the 2nd floor washroom again and dry my hands. ",submission,28

I’ve been looking for a new joint to “bless” for my midday constitutional. 

I don’t wash my hands anyways… or even flush the toilet afterwards if we’re being honest, so it’s all good. 

Enjoy.",comment,6
