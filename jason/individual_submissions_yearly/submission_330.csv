My advice to you is to make friends in your classes, or better, in your tutorials. I also recommend joining clubs you‚Äôre interested in. Personally, I made the mistake of not making friends (I‚Äôm very introverted and the people I did interact with were really not people I would get along with well) and that‚Äôs on me for being super picky. Definitely a lot of people you have the potential to become friends with, but from what I‚Äôve heard from the ‚Äògeneral uoft experience‚Äô is that it‚Äôs hard to make friends and not just ‚Äústudy buddies‚Äù (the ones that just ask for your notes).

Honestly, don't even worry about it. Show up to the orientation and you will meet a lot of very nice and friendly people. Also you will make friends in your classes once the school starts. You should also join lots of clubs because not only do you get a chance to be involved in something you enjoy doing, but you also get to meet lots of people with similar interests. 

Best of luck finding friends at uoft!!!",comment,7

I later moved to off-campus housing, but I still know quite a few people who commute more than one hour daily, including upper years who have been doing that consistently for multiple years.

I did the same, quite frankly after the first week no one really cares where you stay. Most interactions you see in orientation lead nowhere, people have different schedules, find other friends or get too busy. I have only one friend that I met from orientation, but we only talk if we run into each other. 

My frosh was fun because I met someone to hang out with and go to all the events, do the same! Go say hi, you quite literally have nothing to lose lol. If you aren‚Äôt going to put yourself out there, you aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Theres *tons* of chances to meet someone, take one chance :).

Also imo totally not worth the 25k, that‚Äôs almost 2 years worth of engineering tuition (for me). If anything, renting is much cheaper, at almost 50% the cost ($1300/mo) and you get it for 4 more months (12mo lease).",comment,1

Nah  fr I am sorry that you felt that way but trust me it all depends on you and how social you are. I know it sucks to go home early and you did the right thing to commute. My commute is an hour too . sometimes I stayed in campus till 2 am to study and work on problem sets meanwhile my mom kept calling me to go home which I found annoying but I did enjoyed my times with friends. And honestly most these kids will not be in res in their 2nd and 3rd years. They all live in a small room and their family are away from them , they have to cook for themselves and they won't have their moms cook for them or spending time with siblings you know? I went to my friends rooms for a sometimes and I rathered my own room so yeah just make the best out of your time and hey you'll be fine. Also If you commute is around my place or at least in the north york area then we can commute together sometimes depending on our schedules. You will be able to find friends like this too just don't worry and enjoy your time \~",comment,1
