It can restrict your movement and can be easily contaminated as it is over your gloves. However, first lab of first year is typically fine. You‚Äôd be provided with a lab coat if the one you have doesn‚Äôt meet their standards (I believe this is mainly bc something like it taking longer for your personal protective equipment (ppe) to ship isn‚Äôt your fault). However the following labs are more brutal. Missing ppe or an unfinished pre-lab notebook are grounds for denied entry. It‚Äôs strict but it‚Äôs a safety thing. I‚Äôd say talk to your TA just to make sure.",comment,1
