I'm using a burner account, as I work for the university (I won't specify further, but I see some of the behind-the-scenes of university administration) and don't want to share any identifiers.

I believe that students should be aware of what's been happening at the University of Toronto regarding students' rights to protest. The university rolled out a new policy without announcement (under the guise of a ""user guide), which essentially disallows all forms of protest which have been practiced for decades on university campuses. You can see the new policies here: [https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/student-policies-guidelines/user-guide-on-u-of-t-policies-on-protests/](https://www.viceprovoststudents.utoronto.ca/student-policies-guidelines/user-guide-on-u-of-t-policies-on-protests/)  
With these policies in place, the university is technically free to call the police on students who protest without permission/booking space anywhere on University of Toronto property. You can assume the university will not be allowing protests which are unfavourable to them ""permission"" to protest. This policy also makes having basic tools for protest criminal.  Megaphones, microphones, etc. constitute ""excessive noise,"" which can get the police called on students. I cannot stress enough how insane this is, and how unprecedented. Also, many of these policies are open to wild speculation. What constitutes ""blocking a space,"" etc? The university has framed its complaint as in favour of ""peaceful protest,"" but most of the things targeted here are elements of peaceful protest. To be direct, the university is taking this tactic precisely because they have been unable to show (in court) that recent student protests have been anything but peaceful. The new policy is a strategy to squash protest the university doesn't like, which is presumably most forms of protest.

I don't necessarily agree with, or like, every protest held on our campus, but I think it's an absolute necessity that students be allowed to protest. Student protests have historically been extremely powerful political tools. Universities have been the site of civil rights protest, protest of South African apartheid, protest of the Vietnam war, etc. Every year, students of many political persuasions protest around issues that matter to them. This new policy is incredibly repressive of student speech.

These policies were rolled out quietly. I have not seen coverage of them, and I do not think the student body is aware (apart from the group which the policies are immediately responding to: students who have been protesting for Palestinian rights).

Most upsetting to me is that the university is clearly okay with attacking students who are fighting for what they believe is right. They are ready to send the police on protesters. Let me be clear, the university does not care about students' wellbeing, or ensuring protests are ""peaceful,"" or have any ethical concerns at play. This is the university as a corporation trying to protect itself from its students precisely because students have recently been successful at exposing the university to moral criticism (which the university has financially suffered from as a result: alumni pulling their donations, etc.). Student protests are working (and admin know how many people support these students and their causes) and so they are trying to shut them down.

I am posting to hopefully stir up some awareness and some outrage.",submission,266

The rules around protests are set out in a bunch of different university [policies](https://freespeech.utoronto.ca/policies-and-statements/). This is a new “guide” to navigating how those policies (and related judicial decisions) interact with one another to govern protests and related activities on campus.

It doesn't restrict the use of microphones or megaphones, but rather ""excessive noise"" which I admit is a pretty flexible definition, but I can foresee the policy allowing the use without punishment.

Additionally, the policy restricts blocking space and is probably targeted at the multiple instances of ""taking over sid smith"" which happened last year. This part of the policy would most likely be used for when a protest attempts to disrupt classes or to prevent students from moving through buildings.

As in: protesting inside sid smith = kicked out, protesting in front of and blocking the doors of sid smith = kicked out, protesting outside of sid smith but students could reasonably walk past the protest = fine.

The policy also says that you can't exclude individuals from protest areas. This would mean that a pro-Israel protest that takes over a field would have to allow for a pro-palestinian to enter the field and vice versa.

Reading between the lines, these policies are meant to prevent the multi-week encampment at kings college circle.

The palestine protest regardless of one's support or not for it, disrupted one's ability to focus and impacted the quality of education that was paid for (eg. Engineering). No one agreed to pay to have classes disrupted or feel scared on campus.

I think people historically think students are weak impressionable pushovers useful to further some cause and doesn't care about the fact that most of us who arent rich are here for one reason, a degree to further our careers.

I can also foresee them using its vagueness to quell protests they don’t like. When you make a judgement on what “excessive noise” is, you can apply it whichever way you want.


> This would mean that a pro-Israel protest that takes over a field would have to allow for a pro-palestinian to enter the field and vice versa.


That’s pretty silly. There’s a reason why police doesn’t allow for protestors and counter-protestors to mix. UofT wouldn’t allow it either: they simply don’t want another encampment.


Regardless, this new policy gives UofT carte blanche to shut down any protest it doesn’t like. You are on King’s Circle and chanting? Excessive noise. You are in front of Sidney Smith and silent? Blocking walking space.",comment,13

And yes, it's absolutely a response to the encampment. But it's an entirely unprecedented response. The judge in that case allowed only that the protesters could not stay over night.

I don't think you understand how index funds work. The university knows what the management companies it invests in are invested in, but refuses to disclose this information (wonder why). We also know that disclosed companies it is invested in are invested in weapons manufacturing. The students are asking that going forward the university have a clear policy that prevents it in investing future funds in management companies which invest in weapons manufacturing (This is doable). This seems to be a reasonable ask, and a well-researched one, done in consultation with lawyers.

“The disruption was condemned by the university president for violating Babb’s ‘right to free speech,’ as well as by the Globe and Mail’s editorial board, who wrote: ‘The point is belabored in the making – that Ambassador Babb has every right to be here, indeed a responsibility to debate, to dispute, to engage. Often such meetings are not allowed in South Africa. This is not South Africa.’…

The reaction to these events was overwhelming, with a flurry of op-eds and letters published in major national newspapers and magazines. Once again the Globe and Mail, the country’s most influential newspaper, came to Babb’s defense, with an editorial titled ‘Don’t ban Mr. Babb;’ it argued that ‘if there is one place where abhorrent ideas and heated issues should find a forum for debate, it is the university campus.’ The Globe and Mail also published a 1000-word piece which claimed that freedom of speech was under attack, and that “the very foundation of our democratic society… is being assaulted...

When Babb finally spoke at the U of T at the end of January, he wore a bullet-proof vest. Outside, the 300 students protesting his presence were met with mounted police.”

There were teach-ins addressing anti-semitism. Many of the organizers have previously organized against anti-semitism and are the kind of people who are actively aware of the dangers of anti-semitic discourse. I'm not saying there's never been an incident of antisemitism in relation to protests for Palestine (there have, as there is antisemitism everywhere and antisemites take whatever opportunity they can to be disgusting), but I don't think actual antisemitism is dealt with by pretending the protests themselves were hateful, rather than about stopping immense suffering, and fighting for Palestinian freedom. I personally know some of the folks in the Jewish Faculty Network. I really do think they're a good resource to talk about these things with if you're willing to be non-judgmental (they are also quite gracious). 

Also, Hillel is not a good faith organization. It's an Israeli lobbying group. Many of the instances of ""anti-semitism"" have been outright fabrications, or in fact examples of anti-Palestinian racism. For instance, considering ""from the river to the sea"" to be a hateful refrain. These were rejected in court. 

I was at the Shabbat in which Naomi Klein spoke about the importance of emphasizing that these are political demands: no apartheid, no genocide, anywhere.

You should Google that instead of embarrassing yourself by saying that asking for transparency is a bad thing.


As to your “why don’t you drop out?,” that’s just outright dumb. A university is a community, not a business. As with every community, change is possible from within if you fight for it. You just need to be part of the community for this to happen.",comment,0

I was exploring your understanding of my premises - to see if we agreed on them as a jumping off point for discussion, or if we didn't agree on them and would need to start discussion somewhere else.

I wasn't asking ""gotcha"" questions because, in my view, curious, respectful, critical discussion is an essential part of a university community, as well as of life in society well beyond universities.",comment,1

You are trying to discredit a valid form of protest from members of our community by suggesting that ""vote with your wallet"" is a valid (and more consistent) form of protest. Despite being told _why_ it is nonsense, you double down by ignoring that a) UofT is not a business, b) protest from within the community has been effective before (e.g. divestment from Apartheid South Africa), and c) leaving a community ""in protest"" is sheepish and absurd (particularly with your example of ""skipping town"").",comment,1
