Non Linear Success Stories: Looking for Students to Interview,time_goat18,1gjif7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gjif7u/non_linear_success_stories_looking_for_students/,1730737750.0,"EDIT: THANK YOU FOR ALL THE RESPONSES. HOWEVER, I AM NO LONGER ACCEPTING MORE AS MANY OF YOU HAVE REACHED OUT TO ME. 

Hey everyone! It's Jessica here, and I'm a features journalist for The Varsity.

I am writing a features article about non-linear success stories that UofT students (or alumni) have experienced. You may have overcome mental health battles, financial challenges, or academic struggles during your journey to attaining your career and/or education goals. But the most vital thing is that you were able to come out victorious.

I see this article as an inspiration for university students struggling through something similar, and I want to showcase your story to celebrate your achievements as well as help others who may be in a situation you were in. 

It will be a safe and comfortable environment as I have overcome struggles myself.

If interested, feel free to dm me here on Reddit or email me at [jessicah@thevarsity.ca](mailto:jessicah@thevarsity.ca)",submission,19
