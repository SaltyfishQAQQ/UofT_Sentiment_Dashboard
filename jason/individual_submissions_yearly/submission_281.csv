Sounds sad I know, don't think this is the case for others, I am low-key jealous lol. Should I just go alone or just screw it......

  
Edit: Thanks to everyone's suggestion especially those who offers to come with me, the ceremony is too long I don't want to waste your time. I decide to go for the experience, going alone is also kinda cool since not much people get to do that LOL. I will just make some connections there and take some photos, if situation is really that bad I can always leave early. ;)",submission,99

You‚Äôve earned your degree and your day of ceremony. One huge bonus about going to your convocation alone is that you are completely unfettered when it comes to making new contacts and networking.,comment,135

Graduation's a milestone, a personal feat.
You got a late date, friends already gone,
They off on vacations, celebratin' movin' on.

Parents might not make it, got you feelin' alone,
Wonderin' if it's worth it, goin' solo to the zone.
But check it, my friend, this moment's for you,
A celebration of the journey, everything you been through.

You put in the work, late nights, early days,
This ceremony‚Äôs yours, man, embrace that praise.
Don't matter if you're rollin' in without a crew,
This is your time to shine, let that spotlight find you.

Jealousy‚Äôs natural, seein' others in their groove,
But don‚Äôt let it shake you, don‚Äôt let it remove
The pride in your stride, the joy in your heart,
Whether solo or with folks, you played your part.

So dress up, show up, make it a day to remember,
Your hard work, your grind, that's what you gonna render.
Capture the moment, take those photos, feel the pride,
You earned this, it‚Äôs your journey, let it be your guide.

So should you go alone? Hell yeah, stand tall,
This is your achievement, no matter who‚Äôs in the hall.
Celebrate yourself, you made it, you thrived,
Graduation‚Äôs your moment, enjoy that ride.",comment,13

I had a student who was finishing an MA with me and transitioning into a PhD.  Because he knew he‚Äôd have another convocation in a few years, he asked if I‚Äôd be disappointed if he didn‚Äôt go.  I said ‚Äúyes, you‚Äôve got to celebrate when you can.‚Äù  He decided to roll with it, invited his mom to come from out of town, came out to lunch with myself and the family of a friend who was graduating with his PhD.  It was a great day!  

Then COVID hit, and he never got to have the ‚Äúbig‚Äù celebration for his PhD.  And I think we are both so grateful he took the opportunity to celebrate when he had it.

Make the best of the day.  You will never regret going, but may well regret not going.",comment,3
