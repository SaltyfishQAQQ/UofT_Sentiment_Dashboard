I‚Äôve been using my UofT email address as my only personal email for my entire adult life, since I started at UofT over a decade ago. Every important correspondence, documents etc. are in that account. I search my email regularly looking for information. I‚Äôve tried to backup or transfer my data and I‚Äôve had nothingggg but issues. Ive tried to follow the instructions they‚Äôve provided and every time I come to a roadblock where I literally can‚Äôt do the thing they‚Äôre telling me to do. Ive been all over internet help forums, made posts on reddit about it and cannot figure out a way to do it. I‚Äôve literally spent days on this already. Not to mention that every account/profile that I‚Äôve created over the last decade+, every drs office, bill ETC. links to this email address. So I have to think of every platform I can and go an change my email address there. That alone is taking forever and I have to get it done before Oct 1 because in many cases they require you to have access to your current email address on file in order to update it‚Ä¶ 

Holy shit. It‚Äôs insane how much of an impact taking away my email address is having on my life.

I‚Äôve been reaching out to support due to all the issues I‚Äôm having and just today they got back to me saying ‚ÄúThe decommissioning process for your account has been temporarily put on hold. As your account decommissioning is currently paused, we kindly request that you refrain from opening any new support tickets related to this process.‚Äù

I wonder if lots of people are opening tickets and they‚Äôre realized how fucked this is. 

The only computer I have access to is a Mac. On my Mac I can only access my UofT email address via outlook on a browser, it doesn‚Äôt allow me to open my email through the outlook app for Mac - it says ‚ÄúThe license provided by your work or school does not enable access to Outlook for Mac.‚Äù Also, the option to export mail isn‚Äôt there on the browser version. It should be, but it‚Äôs not via this account, meaning they‚Äôve likely restricted that as well. Soooo‚Ä¶I have no way of directly exporting my email data‚Ä¶ I already created a new outlook account so it should be simple enough to transfer over your email data, but due to these restrictions, it‚Äôs not. I wrote them about this and that‚Äôs when they replied with the above. For those of you using a windows computer, are you not having this same issue? Are you able to export? 

I‚Äôve also tried to do it through Apple mail and thunderbird, which isn‚Äôt ideal cuz it‚Äôs the wrong file format for outlook, but I‚Äôve even had issues with both of those platforms. 

I‚Äôm also having issues with my contacts, because none of them are actually saved as contacts (which you‚Äôd have to have done manually), they just show up in the ‚Äúdirectory‚Äù when I search a name in the ‚Äúto‚Äù box when sending an email. And there‚Äôs no way to access that list of contacts. It‚Äôs just all insanity that I don‚Äôt have time for, but HAVE to figure out cuz I can‚Äôt lose all my data. I do now have all my mailboxes saved as .mbox files, but they‚Äôre not easily accessible, which i need them to be, because like I said I search through my email regularly to find info that I need. 

Sorry this was very very long but, if anyone else has had the same issues and figured out a solution or is also on a Mac and knows how to go about this, I‚Äôd be very grateful.",comment,8
