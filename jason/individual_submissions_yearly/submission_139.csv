Migrating ~10 years of emails from my U of T account that we were told would be a “permanent” email address and preferred to using services like gmail. I’ve been spending a ton of time going through old emails to make sure none of them are linked to the account that’ll be inaccessible soon.  

Why not at least make email forwarding permanent or charge us for the accounts of the concern is the cost? ",submission,177

I’ve been using my UofT email address as my only personal email for my entire adult life, since I started at UofT over a decade ago. Every important correspondence, documents etc. are in that account. I search my email regularly looking for information. I’ve tried to backup or transfer my data and I’ve had nothingggg but issues. Ive tried to follow the instructions they’ve provided and every time I come to a roadblock where I literally can’t do the thing they’re telling me to do. Ive been all over internet help forums, made posts on reddit about it and cannot figure out a way to do it. I’ve literally spent days on this already. Not to mention that every account/profile that I’ve created over the last decade+, every drs office, bill ETC. links to this email address. So I have to think of every platform I can and go an change my email address there. That alone is taking forever and I have to get it done before Oct 1 because in many cases they require you to have access to your current email address on file in order to update it… 

Holy shit. It’s insane how much of an impact taking away my email address is having on my life.

I’ve been reaching out to support due to all the issues I’m having and just today they got back to me saying “The decommissioning process for your account has been temporarily put on hold. As your account decommissioning is currently paused, we kindly request that you refrain from opening any new support tickets related to this process.”

I wonder if lots of people are opening tickets and they’re realized how fucked this is. 

The only computer I have access to is a Mac. On my Mac I can only access my UofT email address via outlook on a browser, it doesn’t allow me to open my email through the outlook app for Mac - it says “The license provided by your work or school does not enable access to Outlook for Mac.” Also, the option to export mail isn’t there on the browser version. It should be, but it’s not via this account, meaning they’ve likely restricted that as well. Soooo…I have no way of directly exporting my email data… I already created a new outlook account so it should be simple enough to transfer over your email data, but due to these restrictions, it’s not. I wrote them about this and that’s when they replied with the above. For those of you using a windows computer, are you not having this same issue? Are you able to export? 

I’ve also tried to do it through Apple mail and thunderbird, which isn’t ideal cuz it’s the wrong file format for outlook, but I’ve even had issues with both of those platforms. 

I’m also having issues with my contacts, because none of them are actually saved as contacts (which you’d have to have done manually), they just show up in the “directory” when I search a name in the “to” box when sending an email. And there’s no way to access that list of contacts. It’s just all insanity that I don’t have time for, but HAVE to figure out cuz I can’t lose all my data. I do now have all my mailboxes saved as .mbox files, but they’re not easily accessible, which i need them to be, because like I said I search through my email regularly to find info that I need. 

Sorry this was very very long but, if anyone else has had the same issues and figured out a solution or is also on a Mac and knows how to go about this, I’d be very grateful.",comment,8

After this shit why would I want to use another email account managed by them. Not risking something like this happening again. I just opened a basic outlook account. You’re so right though. Expecting people who have no clue how to do this kind of stuff to back up and transfer all their email data on their own is insane, not to mention they’ve restricted many of the basic outlook functions including import/export through the browser version (at least for me on my Mac) and being able to open your account through the outlook app for Mac… so there’s literally no way for me to directly export my email data from my utoronto account.",comment,4
