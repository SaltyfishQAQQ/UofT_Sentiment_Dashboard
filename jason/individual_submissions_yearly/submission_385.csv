Why does the U of T Bookstore suck sooooooo badly?,claire_eh1,1czqtad,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1czqtad/why_does_the_u_of_t_bookstore_suck_sooooooo_badly/,1716573097.0,"I recently got a gift card to the U of T bookstore and figured I should get some U of T merch before I graduate. I wanted a plain U of T water bottle and a crew neck sweater- easy right? Apparently not. Why are there no clear plastic U of T branded water bottles? Why are all the crew neck sweaters not flattering at all, made of plastic, and super expensive? You'd think that with the school being voted the 2024 most sustainable university in the world, they would at least have plastic-less, sweatshop-less options. I don't mind paying a little more for good stuff, but at the U of T bookstore you pay a little more just because. 

Thank you for coming to my ted talk- if there is anyone in the audience who makes U of T bookstore decisions please do better. ",submission,65

It is owned by a massive company that owns all university bookstores at different schools. The merchandise they stock is prioritized by customizability not quality or price. 
To make the best of a bad thing, it usually has really decent liquidation prices a few weeks into September and early October the extra stock they didn’t sell at the start of semester. Lots of sweatshirts, cups and uoft labeled stuff for 50% off. But never the stock that can be swapped amongst locations.",comment,71

I get your point though. Their clothing don't seem flattering and the price seems a bit high for the quality of some of their products.

Some of the older pieces from the Peace Collective collab looked kinda decent, but I ain't paying $100 for a crewneck.",comment,30

Afterwards we were in Con Hall and I gave her my Iclicker while I used the washroom. She jokingly said ""that's not allowed!"", to which I replied ""neither is stealing textbooks"" lol. 

I wonder what ever happened to Chelsey...",comment,-3
