Exactly what the title says. Just the other day it was 8:30pm at Robarts. Yâ€™all know the Pita Express food truck? I was just ordering a spicy chicken shawarma and I almost broke down in tears just thinking about how this kind lady who works in that truck day and night was boutta give me sustenance. And their truck is always the last to close bc they care about the small amount of students that need to eat at the end of the night. 

Like itâ€™s not just that day. I was getting shawarma from Villa Medina at eatons center and itâ€™s always the same man that makes my shawarmas. I literally felt a father-daughter connection right there even though Iâ€™ve never had a conversation with him. Idk. Maybe itâ€™s just cuz I love shawarmas so much or Iâ€™m just fat asf. Lmk, have yall ever experienced getting emotional over food?",submission,273

Not really similar but still something normal that made me oddly emotional. 

Itâ€™s adorable though and I think it means you view things with a lot of love!",comment,2
