Former Medical School Dean at the University of Toronto returns his Honorary Degree (article from the NaPo copy/pasted here),deleted,1fnt3gt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fnt3gt/former_medical_school_dean_at_the_university_of/,1727119731.0,"A former medical school dean at the University of Toronto has returned his honorary degree in protest at its handling of the anti-Israel protest encampment.



“It’s symbolic. To me it’s a mark of great distinction. I was very proud to get the honorary degree. The fact I’m willing to give it back to signify my discomfort with the university indicates how much my discomfort is,” said Arnold Aberman, a professor emeritus and former dean of the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, in an interview Monday.



He said he was “profoundly disappointed” that there was no clear statement from the administration that “what’s going on is unacceptable.”



In particular, he pointed to the enforced exclusion of “Zionists” from the encampment on the school’s central lawn, a term Aberman said seemed to simply mean “Jews.”



“You saw the signs, anti-Zionist signs, denying entry,” he said. “There’s no right to stop people.”



When the school obtained a legal injunction against the protest after several weeks, and the encampment broke up in advance of a court ordered deadline, Aberman said it was “too late.”



“It’s never too late to do the right thing,” he said. “I think they should have done it earlier.”



Aberman received his honorary Doctor of Laws in the summer of 2015, in recognition of outstanding service to the university.



Born in Montreal, he trained there and in California before becoming an intensivist and later physician-in-chief at Toronto’s Mount Sinai Hospital. He served as dean of the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, and in the administration promoting relations with health-care institutions. He was also a key creator of the Northern Ontario School of Medicine University in Sudbury.",submission,48

But we can see what's acceptable and what's not based on the administration's actions.

The university removed Imam Omar Patel as a chaplain at UTSC for allegedly comparing the Israeli government to Nazi Germany in an Instagram post. However, the university appears to have taken no action against Professor Ramy Elitzur, who compared Jewish students taking part in the [O4P] encampment to Jewish people who collaborated with Nazis during a Governing Council meeting. https://thevarsity.ca/2024/09/23/u-of-t-president-meric-gertler-sits-down-with-the-varsity-for-the-last-time/",comment,29

what makes democracy great is;
sky gods aren’t invited to the table, if they were women wouldn’t be for one example.They wouldn’t invite each other either I bet.  Collaboration and Diversity is why humans are so successful. bananas can tell you why monoculture is bad.    There’s a lot of things in the world to be upset about like, the Government of China killing their own people for basically doing yoga, meditation practitioners being murdered because the rise of this culture would threaten the longevity of the communist party. Is that going to make people stop doing business with China? No. capitalism and communism cannot exist without each other. They arise mutually. 

we also have our first declared muslim state afghanistan who is moving forward a bill that will lower the age of consent to 9 because the dude in their book married a 9 year old therefore it’s law. image that monoculture.

You don’t get to go into a space that is for protest to stir shit up. The same way Anti-Palestinian Genocide protestors don’t go inside Hillel to protest — which used to be a space for Jews to gather on campus, and is now a mouthpiece for CIJA and the Israeli lobby.

I have no desire to stir things up I just think banning Zionists from a certain location disproportionately impacts Jews and makes most Jews uncomfortable to be there, thus antisemetic in effect, even if not in intent. Hillel is no less of a place for Jews to gather on campus than ever, and its position on Israel broadly reflects the Jewish student body on this campus, tho views are varied. I never engaged them in a genuine matter but to be fair that's because they had a position of ""non confrontation"" where they refused to engage in dialogue with those who disagreed with them, and refused to defend their position against legitimate criticism.",comment,2
