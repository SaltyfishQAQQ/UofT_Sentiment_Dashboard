Edit: There was an announcement that acknowledged that some marks were wrong but they don’t know what happened and they’ll figure it out after the break, so if you are in the class don’t worry about your grade right now

Edit 2: The grades got mostly fixed, it went up to a 92%, so I am pretty sure they still counted badges a bit wrong or the instructions for getting them were terrible but who cares at this point",submission,153

It's an objective perspective though so it's incredibly important.

Mat135 is a first year university course. It's easy to reduce all the complaints about it's coordination as ""high school students getting a reality check about university"". 

Students expect the same standard they have in their other classes. Being able to calculate your own grade as the semester progresses shouldn't be this complicated. 


TAs probably got inundated by questions about the syllabus all semester.",comment,7

As with everything, there's probably a mix of the reality check and the course being poorly organized. Although I'd agree with the students on this one for sure. First year is pretty challenging enough even with well-organized/instructed courses.",comment,5
