Is anyone aware on what to do? ",submission,20

I would email and ask them.

I also really hate how they've done this but I do partially understand, just because there seems to be SO much more spam today than when I attended (up to '21.) But also just a good reminder to not use your school email for such things and use your personal email instead.

I ended up using Thunderbird to transfer **all** of my emails because I know I have documents that I can't lose but I don't have time to comb through all of them, either. (Again, really annoying how they didn't have a way to automate this. I do a good job of keeping my important files on me but you never know...)",comment,13

I got my original account deleted too, then transferred everything to my alumni account.

Try sending an email to your mail.utoronto.ca account to test if it gets forwarded to your alumni account. It took a few days before the mail from my original account started automatically forwarding to my alumni account.",comment,2
