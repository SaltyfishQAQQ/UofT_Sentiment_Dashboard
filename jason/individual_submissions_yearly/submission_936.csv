It is my first time entering university and I am unprepared for the completely different teaching methods and life. I swear I was a very good student in high school, so I feel helpless and scared about my current grades.   
I want to enter Physiology in my second year. If I do very well in the second semester, do I still have a chance?",submission,15

Just email the physio department if your concerned as they get a lot of questions like this",comment,2

Departments under medical science are usually somewhat flexible when it comes to admission, e.g. if you did badly in a subject thatâ€™s required for POSt in the fall, you can outweigh it by doing well in other POSt subjects in the winter. Or you can also apply again in the second year. Uni is def quiet a bit to adjust to, but the winter courses will be around the same difficulty and are ran about the same way as fall courses, so reevaluate your study methods, use your given resources, reach out for assistance if needed, put your worries aside and put your best foot forward.",comment,1

We need to know what youâ€™re looking to get out of this degree, med school, physio therapist, or some other profession?

Certain programs have more focus on high lab work/research while others are lighter gpa-wise. Not sure which one suits you, but some programs you wonâ€™t make like LMP can be crossed off.",comment,3

Iâ€™m in the human bio program, was able to take psl300 and 301 and absolutely love the hmb courses uoft offers.
