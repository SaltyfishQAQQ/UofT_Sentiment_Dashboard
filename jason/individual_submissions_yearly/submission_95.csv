I personally always make sure I make the dumbest mistakes ever when I am there - no matter how prepared I am, I will always make some ridiculous mistakes and once I leave I know exactly what I should have written instead. 
The only exception was my BIO130 final when I think I did good but I have never actually seen it.",comment,45

It's so impersonal that there's nothing to distract me from locking in and writing away. It's also so different from any other setting I could normally find myself in that I can essentially mentally isolate myself from everything else while I'm there.

But maybe I'm just romanticizing the past, I haven't been there to write an exam in years now.",comment,10
