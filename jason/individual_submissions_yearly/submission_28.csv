Back when I was in UofT I actually did IT for a small department in the medical side; it was mostly full-time people in most roles, and many of those people were not the brightest spring chickens. 

One of the biggest issues is that ironically the pay at the university is kinda shit, but the benefits are out of this world. As a result young, well educated graduates want nothing to do with it because they want to build a nest egg, but it does attract older crowd seeking more stability who want to take advantage of all the benefits. 

Net result is that most people working IT in the university are in their 50s and 60s, and wouldn't know how to design a scaleable cloud based system even with a gun to their head. Meanwhile, the profs that know how to do that do not have any sort of access too the management plane, and can't actually do anything beyond experiments in their own lab.",comment,7
