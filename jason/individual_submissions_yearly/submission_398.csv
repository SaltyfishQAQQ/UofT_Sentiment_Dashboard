Anyone interested in a free trip from TO to MTL and back soon?,meddictions,1hhd3vj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hhd3vj/anyone_interested_in_a_free_trip_from_to_to_mtl/,1734559439.0,"I'm traveling from Toronto to Montreal and back from the 22nd to the 31st on ViaRail. I have two cats, but it's one per passenger, even if I buy two tickets...

It's a long shot, but I'm hoping someone would be interested in going there and back on or around those dates. You wouldn't have to pay for anything as I would cover your ticket. I'd just need you to put one of my carriers next to you, but that's it. I'm pretty desperate, so I'd even pay extra.

Please let me know, thank you.",submission,61
