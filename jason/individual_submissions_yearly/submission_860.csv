My Awful experience in MAT246 with Soheil + advice,accounts9837,1cs8bje,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cs8bje/my_awful_experience_in_mat246_with_soheil_advice/,1715734597.0,"MAT246 (Concepts in Abstract Mathematics) is a proof-based course in number and set theory.¬†

TLDR: The course is irrationally structured and poorly taught. Make extensive use of the textbook and chatGPT as they are better at explaining the material than the prof.

This is a very long review but I think it will prove useful to future students of this course.

*Structure:*

When I took the course, both sections followed the same syllabus, which was set out by Soheil. The structure of the course was terrible and bizarre. The course is out of 108% meaning it has 8% bonus marks, but according to the syllabus itself, more can be arbitrarily added without notice, at the prof‚Äôs whim. For example, after the low scores of the first test, a quiz was administered during the last twenty minutes of a tutorial (this quiz was never mentioned in the syllabus) and the quiz was counted as a bonus, with a 10% weight to the final test mark. Such a boon was not given after the second test. There is also an 800 word essay due at the end of the course worth 4%. It is does not have a rubric and can receive bonus marks for ‚Äúthoughtful responses‚Äù. As the course progressed, weekly assignments had increasingly more bonus marks. In the problem sets, some questions were not worth any marks while others were bonus, and it was not known what questions counted for what prior to receiving the set back. In addition to bonuses, this course is known for curbing grades. These two features are mentioned in some reviews as positives: they in fact should be viewed as a tacit admission of the prof‚Äôs inability to create an objective, upfront grading scheme, where marks are not adjusted or added according to class performance, caprice or whatever else.

Some material was taught without ensuring the necessary background was covered or the material was outright irrelevant. Hilbert's hotel problem was brought up before discussing sets, the prof, after having this pointed out to him, replied that anyone lacking in knowledge of set notation or concepts of set infinite (which he would later teach any way and which had no relation to the concurrent material, zero had not yet be defined) should take their complains to their previous calculus prof. And in another strange turn, while he said Hilbert's hotel will be in tests or problem sets, it never was. Thus, it was mentioned, said that it would be tested on, but never covered nor tested. Soheil introduced puzzles, unrelated to the material, to train logical thinking. Can doing problems related to the course not do the same and improve your mark at the same time? His planning was utterly unintegrated.

He also tends to be evasive to questions. A student asked if RSA protocol would be on the test four or so days before the test. He responded the night before, casually mentioning he forgot to include it in the study package. At one point, many students complained on piazza (first time I have witnessed such a thing) on the difficultly of the course and lack of aid. The prof's response was nil.

*Lectures:*

In two words: confusing and useless. Soheil constantly made analogies with math concepts to real world things which were unnecessary and convoluted (he once compared the expansion of the rationales with field extensions to the fact that, after 9/11 it was discovered that the area underneath was once on water, thus the land was ‚Äúexpanded‚Äù). Mostly, the lectures consisted of him reading from the textbook, adding some contorted explanation or analogy. He was often ungrammatical and it was difficult to understand what exactly he meant by what he said. Also, he was sometimes passive aggressive in his Piazza responses.

After each lecture there is a quiz. For me, this was terribly inopportune as I had to do it at 8pm while rushing to catch the train. Similarly, other students had to commute, possibly without wifi. I found the timing of these quizzes to be very inconsiderate toward the students.

Soheil stated that the content in the earlier chapters will not follow that of the textbook and that the style of proofs demanded in this course are to be formal whereas the ones in the book are informal. Given this, I at first, avoided using the book which was a grave mistake as it is like the Rosetta stone compared to the lectures which are like Sumerian cuneiform. ¬†

And I feel that Soheil gave misleading advice on how to study and learn. He rarely took up problems or proofs in the lectures (and few were done in tutorials), which, as I came to learn, is a major failure give that this course is introductory and a major part of math is repeated problem solving. He emphasized rote memorization of many theorems and lemmas, saying that tests mostly require ""passive knowledge"" when in fact only two or three theorems were relevant and needed citing.

Advice:

With exception to the first part of the course which does not at all follow the textbook, use the latter for the rest of the course. Invest in chat GPT-4 (or whatever is the current version). It explains the concepts incomparably better than the prof and can help in understanding proofs (by giving it a screenshot/picture of the textbook). I suggest looking over the workbook slides and doing the problems. They do not explain the material well and are often ungrammatical but they will contain any material in the course which is not in the textbook. Use the time during lectures and tutorials to read the textbook and work on problems. It is a much better use of time than carefully listening to the prof. Perhaps check in time to time to make sure you are on the right drift. In learning a chapter, I suggest this approach: first taking note of all relevant definitions (this is bedrock of any future knowledge), then read through the lemmas and minor theorems (this helps in learning what a good proof consist of and they may reveal some techniques or tricks), commit to memorize and take note of a major theorem (it is much easier to establish the context of the theorem when you know how its derived than just committing it to memory) and finally, do many problems. It is impossible to over emphasis this. Your motto in mathematics *must* be: *repetitio est mater studiorum.* That is, repetition of problem solving. Rote repetition or memorization, is worth little outside of knowing the definitions and major theorems.

¬†

I wish you luck in this course. Writing proofs is an excellent way to develop logical thinking skills. This course could really be excellent if only the prof was not this awful (the worst I‚Äôve ever had in fact).

On top of all of the things you mentioned above, I encountered an ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE TA in this course. He is the WORST teaching assistant I have EVER had. He gives hard quizzes and marked extremely harsh, can't explain ANYTHING, rude and dismissive, and to put the cherry on top, he FALSELY ACCUSED ME OF ACADEMIC MISCONDUCT (edit: during the tutorial quiz, it was actually someone else copying off me without my knowledge)!!!!

I had him for MAT224 and MAT246. It's true that his lectures are all over the place and that his rubrics are unorganized, but the style that he approaches this course kind of matches it perfectly in my opinion. This is a course about abstract math and his use of weird analogies and open style lectures mean that the students who pay attention actually absorb the bigger picture ideas instead of memorizing definitions. The lectures are usually pretty entertaining and he is actually really approachable if you talk to him. I've never had a prof that was more helpful in office hours. He would take the time to go through problems with you and would really nudge you in the right direction. Not to mention that he gives massive curves in his class. Its a bit weird to get used to his style but in general reading the textbook attentively and then going to class and just trying to see the bigger picture he is painting is a great introduction to higher level math courses.",comment,1

I meant that discussing Hilbert's Hotel after covering sets and infinite (a concept which at least in this course was only brought up during set theory) would have established some useful backround for the problem.

Mathematics is a hierarchy of knowledge, with each stage more abstract than the next. In trying to concertize an highly abstract concept, one has to work to keep in mind the concrete and the several layers of abstraction connecting it to the concept. This is further complicated by the fact that, often the concrete is not a perfect analogy of the concept, so it is comparable only in a limited respect. In order to not overload the mind, high level concepts should be built from and related to slightly lower level concepts. Once you integrated everything, then fine, you can run up and down the cognitive hierarchy but to try to do to in the process of building it, is begging for confusion and hardship.",comment,1

- 10 points weekly quizzes (12, lowest 2 dropped)

overall i found it fair, the problem sets were tough but fairly marked and easy to get an A on, and I ended up getting an A on the course even with some difficulty on the final.
