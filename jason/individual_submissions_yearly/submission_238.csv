Guilty or not, you should consult a licensed lawyer. Anything your lawyer says shall replace anything I say (or anyone else). U of T students can consult a lawyer from DLS for free. Don‚Äôt lie to your lawyer. Tell them everything. Tell them your goals and concerns. They are bound by confidentiality, so you are safe. They are on your side. Do what they say.

If you are being genuine, then you do not need to worry. Just make sure you know exactly what the charges are and whether they apply to you.

They say there are four levels of escalation. However, the first three levels (professor, head, dean) are not a court. They are like the prosecutor/plaintiff. However, this means that they can drop the charges early if they want for whatever reason.

If they think it is a waste of time, they will just drop the charges and you are free.

If they request details, you should only provide what you are comfortable with. If you are not comfortable, then tell them through email. Always make a reply. Don‚Äôt provide personal medical details or anything embarrassing. They are not on your side, but you should still show respect by being reasonable. Remember that what you say to them can be used against you.

Do not admit guilt if you are innocent of the charges. 

Do not accept any deal if you are innocent.

If they escalate to the court, (The Tribunal, not Dean or Provost), then you NEED a lawyer. Be honest with your lawyer, and give them everything they need. Not ‚Äúa little bit‚Äù. Everything. Including medical records. Remember, the lawyer is on your side, and is bound through confidentiality. Listen to your lawyer for instructions. Just make sure they are actually your lawyer. Not registrar, or provost, or professor.

The whole system is deeply flawed until you get to the tribunal/provost‚Äôs office level. The Dean‚Äôs designates are so poorly trained regarding when to drop a case that it‚Äôs practically a joke. The number of cases before the provost‚Äôs office is so deep that they can barely sort through them all and it can take more than a year before charges are even brought.

The rules of evidence remain the same, just that the threshold for conviction is lower. As I said in my other post, it‚Äôs essentially running on the same rules as a civil court but without a judge. 

The reason there is only a 1% non-conviction rate is because we don‚Äôt have enough time or people to look at every case that is forwarded to the provost‚Äôs office. This means that the lawyers who work for the provost‚Äôs office are making judgments about which cases they choose to proceed with (much like a real prosecutor). Because they are also overwhelmed, they only proceed with slam-dunk cases where the evidence is pretty damning. 

As such, conviction is overwhelmingly the most common result but the punishments are pretty varied. The tribunal relatively frequently presses the prosecution for explanations on punishment and will consider lower punishments when warranted.",comment,0
