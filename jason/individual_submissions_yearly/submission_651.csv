I am currently in a graduate program going back to the job market and wondering how you guys doing. 

To be honest, looking at my peers who graduated with me, none of them are struggling. I know I struggled but I had a low gpa and no experience.

We managed to find jobs in a year. You will too! Itâ€™s going to be ok. There are things that will definitely help get your foot in the door, build your resume, and develop your skill set. 

- Highlight your skills on your CV, not your experience

- Donâ€™t volunteer your GPA on your CV, employers never ask for it anyway

- Volunteer with an organization you care about. You will build skills, and gain experience. My volunteer job actually led to a paid staff position on a campaign, which ultimately led me to the US House of Representatives! 

- Network! See if you can get coffee meetings with people who work in the same industry you want to pursue, or a company where youâ€™d like to work. 

- Get feedback from recruiters 

Your peers probably arenâ€™t being super honest about the caliber of the work they are doing. Itâ€™s so easy to get caught up in all that. Everything always looks better from the outside.",comment,5

When it comes to things like that, its merely a metric by which they can separate otherwise equal candidates.
