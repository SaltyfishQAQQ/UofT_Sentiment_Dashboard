There is a pumping truck in the Quad every few mornings ,Sleepinggiant416,1ew0ii0,https://i.redd.it/p62tpj227mjd1.jpeg,1724070599.0,Good morning I have seen this truck pumping out something from the Quad over the last few weeks and the hose just sits in the bottom of the field all the time. The area here also smells sort of damp. Anyone know what is going on? This is a brand new build? ,submission,47

Hopefully this truck fix is temporary.,comment,37

My guess is that the field has a substrate layer that is supposed to drain water off into the sewer. But notoriously the City of Toronto's storm and wastewater system has been struggling to deal with the recent rain and its often backed up lately. So the field is failing to drain off water, flooding and probably getting dank from sewage backflow too.

There's a huge infrastructure project that's due to complete this year, the city has been boring massive underground tunnels to expand sewer capacity - [A look at the massive project to prevent Toronto flooding (youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7r-3IFFgQ0)",comment,2

The grass can be pretty wet even after a day it rains,comment,1
