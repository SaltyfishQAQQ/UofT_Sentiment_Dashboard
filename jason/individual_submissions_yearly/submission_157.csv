From that, I learned school isn't sh\*t... Too much nonsense going on, the method of teaching has huge problems of promoting interest, and the profs & TAs probably know their stuff, but just don't give a sh\*t at teaching..., and that's just not how the industry works. U of T failed at teaching courses & material, as they absolutely suck at doing that, however, what they did well was they teach resilience - that's the only thing that's actually useful in the job field, any other textbook material, you throw that away as soon as you exit the campus. So don't panic, you suck at school (or you don't... whatever you wanna call it...) doesn't mean that you won't be successful in the field. I've seen too many exam writing machines around me that got consistent 3.7-4.0 GPAs but cannot handle a simple design problem. As I'd like to say as a MECH, get your hands dirty - get exposed to the ""actual"" industry, don't worry too much about grades - as long as you pass all of them (unless you wanna do masters? But I am not that kind of material, I like actual money-earning jobs better...).",comment,2
