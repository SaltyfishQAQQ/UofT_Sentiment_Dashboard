CR/nCR going into cGPA calculations for post undergrad admissions,Historical_Doctor830,1hlp3h9,https://i.redd.it/ontj61gbsv8e1.jpeg,1735082913.0,"Hi there!
I was looking through the UofT pharmd admissions page and noticed this CR NCR section‚Ä¶ does this mean they will take my actual grade on file for the cr/ncr course and use it in the cgpa calculation??
Thanks.",submission,25

Some schools use CR as a 50% and use it to compute your cGPA, but some also only consider your last 2 years, so if you used CR/NCR in first or second year you could still be ok.",comment,6

A CR/NCR in the first year or two isn‚Äôt a red flag at all. If upper year courses in a recent show signs that you don‚Äôt have faith in your ability to pass courses, then there might be some concern. This goes beyond just the grade itself, since they will arbitrate your application based on how they perceive your ability to succeed in their program.",comment,1

I wasn‚Äôt aware of this and CRed an elective course for my second year that i was gonna get a ~80% in‚Ä¶ Is it also undesirable to have CRs in elective courses as well?,comment,1

Any CR/NCR can be a red flag for committees, but it‚Äôs honestly hard to tell what kind of decisions will need to get made (like comparing two people who are very similar to decide who gets accepted right at the cut-off might be the only scenario where it would matter directly). Typically, committees want to see an upward trajectory and increased stability but that is only for judging people who are in the ‚Äúmaybe‚Äù pile. In the maybe situation, I think any CR/NCR indicates to the committee that you had something to hide, so the assumption is that you thought you would fail the class (we really warned grad students to not do this at the start of covid but it became a norm).",comment,1

Do you know if there‚Äôs a way for me to see what I got in them so i can calculate my cgpa? I just need to find how i would calculate it overall‚Ä¶,comment,2

Honestly, the application process for these kinds of programs tends to be more holistic anyways: nothing is a deal breaker, such a cgpa. The things that will set you apart really are extra circulars, experience, and the strength of any letters you submit. Edit., I checked and I guess they require no letters. Super odd. However my experience is that coming from U of T will be in your favour either way.",comment,1
