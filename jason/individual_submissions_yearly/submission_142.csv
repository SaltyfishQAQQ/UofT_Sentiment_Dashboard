There's nothing she can do to mollify the hundreds of students that are up-in-arms. Especially before the new year. 

She's specifically addressing the students whose marks were supposedly inputted wrong. 

Yeah it's kinda wild that so many students feel like they got done dirty....but it's totally possible that the marking scheme isn't as ""equitable"" as SMT thinks it is.

The “teh” is giving I wrote this on my phone. The shocking lack of empathy for a first year course (legitimately new to the university and very worried about marks) honestly breaks my heart. 

If worded differently it could have been better “I know these marks are very important to you and we will get to the bottom of this once break is over” would have gone over much better.",comment,34

The two biggest issues with Professor Mayes Tang are the confusing syllabus (which I assume she is responsible for this year as the course coordinator) and the fact that she doesn’t teach at all. Instead, she only asks questions in class.

Regarding the spelling mistake, I wouldn’t be surprised if she drafted her email on her phone. My recent communication with another professor confirmed that they do this more often than I thought. They misspelled my name three times, and their responses showed no sincerity or empathy, despite my considerable extenuating circumstances and supporting documents. So I’m not particularly mad about Mayes tang response since I have dealt with worse communications and my expectations are now pretty low.

I had a nice conversation with Mayes tang about a book I was reading and she seems to be a great person, she’s just a little bit  stubborn with her teaching style and there seems to be a big communication gap between her  and students and she’s unable to close that gap.",comment,10
