"The best 300+ course I took this semester, ENT391",The_Great_Corrine,1hi5gz3,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hi5gz3,1734648717.0,"I ended up getting an 89. And all of my classmates were satisfied with their final grades. The class average is very likely to be A- or higher.

ENT391 is one of the best courses I took this semester.

It has a work placement, which is unpaid and only for course credit. You will be working with a startup for the whole semester. It does not have a midterm or final, only participation marks and presentations.

The instructor Aziz Memon is a super nice person. He cares about all of his students and gives us good grades lol.

The only special thing in this course is that you have to apply for it. Check centre for entrepreneurship for more information or email them. There are various roles that you can apply to.",submission,40

How did the placement work, meaning do you balance that with a regular course load or is it the only thing you are doing like a work term?",comment,5
