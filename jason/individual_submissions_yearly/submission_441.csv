It‚Äôs natural that when you see others doing better at classes, especially math classes where intelligence differences are at play, to feel imposter syndrome or inadequate. But release your ego. You don‚Äôt need to be the smartest or most talanted person, even being moderately below average is fine if you‚Äôre willing to put in the work.

Remember dude, you don‚Äôt need to be anything, let alone smart or talented. Just do what you enjoy and continue working hard. When we start projecting images onto ourselves of ‚Äúoh I‚Äôm this smart university person, I have to live up to x standard‚Äù, that is when we suffer.",comment,17

They annoyed me quite a bit, because when I was asked for help (even just a hint), they would always say they didn't want to share at all. I felt like crap for my entire first year.

I found out a year later that most of the group dropped out due to failing grades. 

Everyone has difficulty at U of T. If someone was smart enough to waltz into university and destroy all courses without any struggle something isn't adding up. You are learning new concepts, and thinking styles that you have not experienced your entire life. 

My suggestion is to make a literal calendar with your plan on how to study and complete these assignments. Find people who are open about their struggles with the course and learn together. Studying with people who are not deluding themselves into thinking everything is easy is the best way to get ahead.",comment,3

Stressing out over a problem set or an assignment will hinder your other materials worth more. My number one tip would be to find a study group. These problem sets can be really really time consuming to solve alone and most people actually do them in groups(people usually dont admit this). I had a study group with 2 of my friends and we used to divide our problem sets into 3 and once we were done, we would just explain our solving processes to each other.",comment,1

Am in a classics elective for funsies and there are people here scoring 97% on their Latin midterms. Makes me feel a little behind! But progress is never linear, only uphill if you want it to be. I'm also academically-driven in the sense that I have high expectations of myself and my success. Sometimes, these shift during your transition from high school to university, which is totally understandable. 

Take a break if you can this reading week and enjoy some things that will help you ease your mind, like involving yourself in an extracurricular. What is ultimately most important is your psychological health and your mindset. It's easy to despair over struggle, and easier to lose yourself over it. It's a vicious cycle, and you don't deserve that. You can't magically change your academic ability overnight, but you can work towards a better one, like figuring out an academic method that works best for you (for me, short work periods and breaks by socializing with friends often helps. I do physical flash cards and try to buddy up when I study to keep myself accountable, if that helps) or seeking help through classmates, office hours, and advisors. 

Best of luck to you!",comment,1

Part of your schooling will be understanding deep amounts of stress and how you function. You will occasionally meet people and network; through time, you might be close to them and consider some friends. There are some things you can do to help- besides the obvious with some peer-to-peer support from friends or counsellors of some kind- you could consider managing abnormal amounts of stress with breathing exercises (check out Wim Hof or Andrew Huberman), ashwagandha supplementation (a few weeks on and then take a week off), healthy diet that works for you, and making sure your sleep is on track (the book circadian code changed my life). Once you have your first semester and first year down, you'll gain some perspective on how you work and how the school feels, and that'll help give you some momentum and get rid of some imposter syndrome symptoms. It may sound cheesy, but diamonds are forged through pressure, and I think that part of the transformation that comes from university comes from the various pressures we feel. These tips are things that worked for me, but hopefully, they can be helpful for you. Hang in there and keep your head up; you've got this! :)",comment,1
