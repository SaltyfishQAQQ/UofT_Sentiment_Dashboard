Question regarding how life is in the encampment ,Four_Magics,1d7aob0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d7aob0/question_regarding_how_life_is_in_the_encampment/,1717437049.0,"Without any political motivation, I'm just curious regarding how life is in the encampment at King's college circle.. 

Does everyone have a camp to themselves.. is it like a little village or something

Is their toilet access within the encampment or do people walk out of the circle for this purpose.

Whatever the general vibe inside the encampment.. are people working their 9-5s from inside or they just chilling

Are most members of the encampment at any given time frame full time or do they just hang around inside the encampment for a couple of hours?",submission,58
Question regarding how life is in the encampment ,DeliriusBlack,l6yega2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d7aob0/question_regarding_how_life_is_in_the_encampment/l6yega2/,1717442457.0,"Hey! I am not a camper but have visited the liberated zone, so I can't answer all of these questions (hopefully someone who is camping there will hop on this thread later), but I can tell you what I noticed while I was there. 

First when you go to the entrance they will ask you if it's your first time. They have an onboarding process where they explain the rules for being in the circle. They also have an information tent where you can ask questions. 

Walking around, you will notice lots of smaller (I'd guess 1-3 person) tents, which are closed, and a good number of bigger tents. There is a large food tent with people cooking, where they seem to have a very efficient system including sorting waste, collecting grey water, providing plates and utensils, etc. — I don't know what the food is like because I didn't want to eat there since I'm not a camper, but I saw some snacks and tea and coffee being provided (I wasn't there during a meal time). 

There is a tent which has a sacred fire burning, and Indigenous people taking care of the fire, and it's a space where you can go in and sit and talk or just enjoy the atmosphere. It's a very welcoming space and they have a sign at the entrance telling you how to approach the fire respectfully and give an offering of sacred medicines (which are provided). 

There is another tent that acts as a library, with small bookshelves hosting well organized collections of books on politics, religion, history, and more, along with recommended reading lists, pamphlets, and a binder where people can write down book suggestions. 

There is also a care tent that has first aid supplies and a place to rest, and a charging station tent with a full solar panel setup so people can charge their phones, laptops, and other electronics, and even a tent labeled ""legal support"" (which I didn't go into because I figured they have enough on their plates). 

I was just wandering around, talking to people, getting a feel for the vibe, and everyone was very friendly and willing to chat, happy to answer questions, and generally very welcoming. Overall it's a really beautiful space. Everyone involved should be extremely proud of what they've built together. When I left I started crying because I was feeling so emotional about it — I am so beyond blessed to belong to a community that cares so deeply and powerfully. I am trying to do my part with donations, showing up to protests, etc whenever I can but these people are really out here doing the best community work I've ever seen. I can't overstate what a beautiful and powerful thing they have done — these people are so strong and determined, and I am in awe of what they've accomplished in such a short time. 

Not sure where they go to the bathroom though, sorry.

Edit: Forgot to say that people there stay overnight or don't depending on their circumstances. It seems like those who are able to do their work from inside the circle stay, and others just visit during the day. The vibe seemed like a ""do what's right for you, whatever you can do is great"" sort of attitude.",comment,105
