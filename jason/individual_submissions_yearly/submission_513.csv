If you struggle with writing by hand for a disability related reason (e.g. tremors, arthritis, dyslexia, etc), rather than merely hating it, you can pursue academic accommodations like the other user suggests. 

It is a bit late to do so now outside of emergencies, as the general accommodations deadline for ATS was Nov 15, but is something to consider for future semesters. More info linked from here: [https://lsm.utoronto.ca/ats/](https://lsm.utoronto.ca/ats/)",comment,74
