I've met tonnes of students who had objectively high GPA's but still lower than what I thought was rightful for them. 

For instance, I have this one friend. I thought his GPA would be in the 3.9s, but it's at mid-3.7 (which is of course very respectable, but not reflective of his intelligence). Another classmade also has a mid-3.8 when I thought he would be well above 3.9. Even for a friend of mine in the 3.9 range I thought his GPA would be at high-3.9 but is in fact at mid-3.9. 

Another friend of mine whose intelligence I sincerely admire didn't even have high distinction upon graduation (which was very surprising, NGL). 

Don't let GPA define your intelligence. You're all smarter than your GPA says about you. ",submission,168

Obviously intelligence is a huge determinant towards GPA, but something that affects it significantly as well is your life circumstances.

I struggled with anxiety throughout university, and in first year engineering I commuted \~15 hours a week which came with a lot of fatigue/poor sleep. My first semester I had a 2.7 average as a result.

I also never dropped a course even if I did bad on a midterm, growing up in a poor family made me conscious of doing things like that as taking summer courses wasn't something I wanted to spend extra money on. 

Then I moved out in my final year not having to deal with commuting, and got a 3.9 in my last semester. There's other circumstances at play, but removing the commuting aspect helped me a lot (and living away from home made my mental health better).

So yes, I think UofT students are smarter than their GPA especially if they dealt with adverse circumstances that limit their potential.",comment,4

Like there's mandatory stuff in my program which I think is wrong, but it's presented as factually correct in an mcq style on an exam. So you have to roleplay as left leaning to a non-zero amount, and progressively moreso the more you differ from left leaning beliefs. If you don't notice it, it's because you agree with tying fact with politics and are blind to how it should be separate from education and the truth. And if you're in a political program where these things are the topics themselves, I think it's obvious there's less credence given to right leaning beliefs, and the reasoning behind them, than there should be. 

It's an echochamber factory disconnecting people from reality, and from the thinking behind differing beliefs, which is exactly what you'd want to make people more divided. It's a monopoly on education with tiny little political pushes over decades to make sure you don't notice anything as you help build the tower of babel.

Perhaps some companies automatically reject you for low GPA, however many more don't. I don't even think Google has an automatic cutoff for GPA (for jobs at least, idk about intern). Experience is much more important than GPA, and there are many ways to get that. Contributing to GitHub projects/repos, personal projects, etc. Also, in my experience, as long as your employer likes you, it is very easy to keep an internship/co-op. 


Also one thing that people gloss over the most is networking and connections. Anyone can code well given practice. Employers don't expect new hires to hit the ground running (still need to be walking though) and most people who apply are smart enough to learn fast and do a good job. Unless one is a genius, what separates people are how easy and pleasant they are to work with. Having people that knows and likes you in a company you want to work at is 1000 times more helpful and useful than having a great GPA.

It isn’t of course true everywhere. 

For example KPMG, Deloitte, etc consider GPA but then again you’re underpaid and overworked.

The only other place in finance where I’ve seen GPA be considered  is for select front office capital market roles like IB.

One researcher talked about how there's a high degree of certainty, based on their own study, that black women have a glycemic response much lower than white people. Basically that when sugar enters a black woman's bloodstream, it will more readily be turned into body fat as opposed to being consumed as glucose before then. 

Another researcher replied that this perpetuates harmful stereotypes that black women get fat easier, and tied it into systemic oppression, racism, sexism, all the regular leftist sort.

I put as much effort into this assignment as I could, but I decided to take the stance of saying this didn't perpetuate harmful stereotypes because it was just a fact. Black women, on average, more readily get fat from foods high on the glycemic index. 

I made it as articulate as I could, gave reference to environmental factors like how black ancestry had less access to processed sugars than white ancestry, and a bunch of other stuff. It could be that, since black women showed a much bigger difference than black men, that they had more genetic preparedness for having a baby since you need body fat to have a healthy child. I just explored the topic, I don't remember what else I wrote but I do remember I put more effort into it than almost any other assignment I did. (all the underlying physiology was included too ofc)

I've gotten 90s before in supposedly harder courses by just agreeing with the idea that black people always have it harder, and that there's no meaningful natural difference between blacks and whites and any race. Because that's all just environmental, and because of systemic oppression and the intention of the evil white institutions or whatever. But it's obviously true that genes and nature effect outcome to a non-zero amount. And that culture plays a role too.

To side track, there was an amazing developing black culture in the US during the pre jim crow law era. Blacks were taking up more and more government positions and with great success, they were healing from slavery, and people like Muhammad Ali, MLK, and so on become icons in the black community. Their families were put together. But then the CIA funneled crack into black neighborhoods, and the KKK protested against black political power, and destroyed the family unit of blacks, giving rise to a recursive culture of degeneracy and gang violence. You get right wing idiots saying that it's the fault of black people because it's in their nature, which it's not. And they'd know that if they knew the history. It's in their culture now though, and plastering an aesthetic air of DEI and ignoring racial differences only prolongs the root problem. Which is what the CIA wants in order to funnel more blacks into the prison industrial complex, effectively bringing back slavery covertly, and what you learn to perpetuate with left leaning beliefs. It's much more racist to not acknowledge differences, and the strength we have in our inherent diversity.

Anyway, I got a 62% on the assignment where I took the stance that acknowledged racial differences in both nature and nurture. I'd say it's because some of what I said could have been interpreted as communicating that white people's corollary genetic differences in glycemic response would be more advantageous for non-starving countries. Or that it just generally didn't fit the overarching narrative.

The left leaning, patronizing narrative encompasses many more examples, and much more subtly than the one I gave.",comment,0

technically correct answers should not be marked wrong imo just because it doesn't exactly align with course content",comment,1

Btw, did the TA/prof leave any notes explaining why they gave you that mark? And if not, did you ask them why you got that mark? It’s possible that you may have gotten a 62% because you got some information mixed up in your paper, or maybe because you didn’t explain something well enough. It would definitely be a problem if your research was right, however, and I feel like you would be able to make them admit that they marked you unfairly if you ask them enough questions, and request a remark from them.",comment,3

Reminds me of the incident where a woman’s boyfriend was stabbed to death on the street by a black homeless man. Then she refused to identify the murderer in a lineup because she didn’t want to perpetuate sterotypes.",comment,2

And no I didn't ask, but the chances of it being a research error instead of a ""political"" error decreases as I put more effort into it. Like if one assignment is 0 effort 100 left leaning submission and it gets a 90, but another is 100 effort 0 left leaning submission and it gets a 62, I'm increasingly more convinced of all the stuff I wrote already. I'm just going for the degree though anyway so I'm half okay with it, it's just disappointing.

Edit: This assignment was last winter semester anway :/",comment,3
