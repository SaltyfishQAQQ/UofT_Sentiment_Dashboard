Like, I don’t expect to solve the issue in a subreddit, or even expect there to be unanimous agreement with my statement in such a very long, complex, historical & profound series of events.  

But to not have compassion for the people of Gaza is to be heartless, and to at least recognize that the children of Gaza, or anywhere, do not deserve to be starved, bombed & targeted like they have for over a year.

I can site the evidence. And again how does that justify genocide? Do you agree with collective punishment? Also why is beeri part of the Gaza envelope? Did you know that it was created after 48 purposely to put settlers with guns to kill Palestinians refugees from returning home?

Your source about the creation of Be’eri makes no mention of “settlers with guns”, for instance. 

Buffer zones between warring states are as old as conflict itself. I’m unsure why you’re keying in on that fact. 

I do not believe in collective punishment, but urban warfare is a horrific beast. If Palestine was a state, it would have the right to self defence. Unfortunately it chose the route of terrorism. Israeli, as a nation state, has the right to defend itself. 

Please research “proportionality” in the context of the law of armed conflict. If civilians are killed (sadly) because they are adjacent to a bonafide military target, it is not a war crime.",comment,1

The article you sourced, as a response to supporting that “settlers with guns” have occupied Be’eri since its inception, clearly states that the arms distribution occurred as a result of the Oct 7th attack. 

Please do yourself a favour. Stop with emotional, confirmation fallacy esque sources.

I took a gander through your comment history. You appear to be a propagandist. Interesting..",comment,1
