Concerns About Getting Into Grad School Here: My GPA is kinda flat ngl,daervverest2001,1golixp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1golixp/concerns_about_getting_into_grad_school_here_my/,1731305027.0,"I'm wondering if anyone has been accepted into U of T’s engineering graduate program with a relatively flat GPA throughout their undergrad. My cumulative GPA is 77%, but I’m unsure how that converts to the 4.0 or 4.3 scales. Over the years, my GPA has fluctuated within a range of 77 ± 2%, and I know that graduate committees often look for an upward trajectory. I have a strong research background, including publications, but I'm concerned that my GPA, especially a C+ in one of my 4th-year Statistics courses, might affect the competitiveness of my application. Currently, I’m at UBC, pursuing a Double Major in Chemistry and Statistics, and I'm hoping to transition into Chemical Engineering. Has anyone had a similar experience where they don't have strong grades but still got in? ",submission,20

two barriers you need to get through  
1. SGS  
2. the department you care about (in your case, Applied Chemistry and Chemical Engineering)  
which is contingent upon: PI interest, letters of reference, your research proposals/intent statements, or whatever      they ask of you.

gpa requirements are just a thing for SGS, the first filter.   
for the rest (the hard stuff) you ***NEED*** to have the right research experiences or extracurriculars (some relevant job or club experience).   
basically, something to show that you really do care for this sort of work.

i'm from the dept. of chemistry but the same process applies. and from my friends who went onto do the MASc in BME/CHE from chemistry undergrad, they can confirm.",comment,9

I am but just want to confirm. Also, if I have a bunch of research experience but in different fields including chemical engineering and research experience at U of T.
