Professor gave every grad student an assignment grade of zero for not attending a particular lecture,AzureFantasie,1h644xn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h644xn/professor_gave_every_grad_student_an_assignment/,1733275552.0,"Just to preface this by saying that nowhere in this course’s syllabus was it ever mentioned that attendance may be tied to grading for any assignments in this course.

But essentially the professor threw a temper tantrum and gave everyone a zero for two essays worth 6% of the overall grade, all because only one grad student showed up to a particular lecture where the readings for one of those essays were discussed. This is also in a course with brutally hard assignments that are extremely time consuming and unlike a lot of other grad courses an 80 is NOT guaranteed if you put in a lot of effort.

A 70 is a fail in grad school in case you don’t know, and this course grades like an undergrad course so expected averages are in the mid 70s. So this loss of 6% of our grades puts a good number of us in peril of failing this course, all because we didn’t attend a particular lecture because it was NEVER communicated to us that attendance is tied to grading.

Is there anything we can do in this situation?",submission,268

If you haven't done so already, you may want to find out what grades signal in your program.  For example, if A- or better indicates that you know the material enough to not have to take a qual exam in that topic, then you would want to know that.

As for what to do... first, speak w/ the prof.  Then speak w/ the graduate chair, if needed.  However tempting it is to go directly to the graduate chair w/o speaking w/ the prof, don't do this.

You may want to familiarize yourself w/ the GPP but if there are any irregularities between the course and the GPP I would encourage you to phrase this as ""I was wondering..."" rather than citing it at them.

Your prof. sounds pissed off and they threw their toys out of the pram. You need to engage with them and find out why they are deviating from the course outline (learning expectations are part of the contract) and then escalate if necessary to the graduate program director.   
You also need to plan to participate in the courses you have paid tuition for and own your own (non-)learning. If there is in-class instruction you are expected to be in-class. Back in the dinosaur age when I was a grad student, it was called bunking off or skiving and it had consequences.

Arbitrarily throwing out the method of evaluation that was already outlined to students at the beginning of the semester without giving prior notice and attaining a majority consent from students on the changes to grading methods is simply in violation of the university’s grading policy and demonstrates an egregious lack of consideration for the student’s efforts and time.",comment,8

That is policy and the graduate program director will be supportive of that position also. The can’t change grading on a whim, nor throw temper tantrums using a marking non-scheme.

At the same time, if instruction is in-person, any student registering for the class should absolutely plan to attend in-person and none of this bs abt living far away. Tne prof has research to do and actual publication and grant deadlines, and they show up.

I am sorry, but this somewhat screams a disconnect from the realities of a lot of students trying to attend this university whilst trying to maintain a healthy schedule and live in a financially sustainable manner on stipends alone without other support.

I am currently living more than an hour and half away from campus by train, where I can find a place to live that doesn’t cost more than my entire stipend. The time spent to transit to school and back takes out more than 1/8 of an entire day, and roughly 1/5 of my hours awake in an entire day. This is not an insignificant amount of opportunity cost, and often not entirely worth it if on that day I have only a single one hour lecture where attendance was not explicitly highlighted as vital to grading. 

This once again goes back to communicating your expectations as a professor, you cannot not make it explicit that attendance is required for grades, and then get upset when few students show up to the extent that you are willing to throw established grading guidelines for the course completely out of the window.",comment,4
