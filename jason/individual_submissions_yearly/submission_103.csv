Supporting a organization's ""American branch that was designated as a terrorist group by the FBI"" in a protest is agitation, but supporting Hamas which just launched an attack last year against a music festival that took hundreds of people hostage is freedom of speech.

  
Having people waving Israel flags and ""openly displayed violent and dehumanizing slogans"" is ""failing to keep students safe"", but having a whole lawn locked down in the center of the school for weeks is not.

  
Just what is the point here? Two weeks ago, Palestine supporters literally breached into a lecture - ECE1513 - and started shouting through a megaphone. I was in that lecture. Most people in that class weren't even Canadians, they were Chinese and Indians - international students who have absolutely nothing to do with Canadian politics. I say that counts more as ""failing to keep students safe"" than having people waving flags and ""dehumanizing slogans"" outside of a building. I am going to post that video in this sub.

  
Don't you Palestine supporters understand that Palestine has one and ONLY one goal, and that is to completely wipe out Israel from Earth? They launched a genocide in 1948, it is just that the genocide failed. A failed genocide is still an attempted genocide, you don't get to be righteous just because you are weak, nor do you get the privilige of breaching into a fcking lecture!",comment,-6

I mean its revealed, and sadly its an op-ed so you know, that's just the way she goes. This is a terrible article and the Varsity should be ashamed. Now anyone can go to my profile and say ""oh wow look at the bias there"" but lets examine this article at face value shall we?

""As the President of the Muslim Students’ Association (MSA), it is clear to me that the U of T administration has failed to protect its Muslim and Arab students, along with their peers and allies. To me, this failure demonstrates an indifference to these students’ safety and reveals institutional biases.""

How is this ""clear"" when at this current time, the antisemitic rhetoric on campus is at an all time high, which the court ruling quite literally stated.

""Other vigilantes from JForce, a private security firm and self-described “[defenders of Israel](https://jforce.org/),” roamed the campus in groups [dressed in black uniforms and tactical vests](https://x.com/SMohyeddin/status/1832101772137234659). Meanwhile, Magen Herut — [an extremist group based in Canada](https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2024/10/14/zionist-safety-patrols-on-campus-have-little-concern-for-jewish-safety) — was also spotted on campus, **creating an intimidating atmosphere for Muslim students.""**

There were literally chants for death to the Jews, signs that threatened Jews, the open antisemitism was at an all-time high and this is the assessment the OP of this article comes to?

""This growing wave of Islamophobia and anti-Arab violence is reflected in the rest of North America. In the past year, a man murdered [a six-year-old Palestinian-American boy in Illinois](https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/15/slaying-muslim-child-illinois-war-00121649), and another man ambushed and shot three [Palestinian college students in Vermont](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/palestinian-students-shot-burlington-vermont-interview-hospital-recove-rcna133822). Additionally, [far-right counter-protestors attacked peaceful pro-Palestinian student protestors](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/05/03/us/ucla-protests-encampment-violence.html) at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""

OP, have you considered that idk, that there are 2 BILLION Muslims in the world? Jews are not even 3% of the population in Canada, this isn’t to diminish your concerns about what has transpired in what you have linked, but seriously?

[According to the GOVERNMENT OF CANADA](https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/canada-holocaust/antisemitism.html) over 900+ attacks on Jews in 2023 alone...

or according to  [the CBC](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/bnai-brith-antisemitic-report-record-high-1.7195197) ""B'nai Brith, a Jewish advocacy organization, said that between Jan. 1, 2023 and Dec. 31, 2023, it logged 5,791 incidents of antisemitism, surpassing the previous record of 2,799 reported in 2021""

So let me get this straight, there are more than 20x Muslims, but 4x less attacks on them compared to Jews, but we need to protect the interests of a growing population in Canada, one that is on the cusp of being a large stakeholder in the Canadian sphere, over an actual minority?

Without getting into these specific circumstances, just saying “but I’m Jewish” is not a defence against being antisemitic. There is a long, long history of Jews who saw selling out the Jewish people as their path to safety, acceptance, and glory. FFS even the Nazis had Jewish collaborators.

These are fringe radicals. Every mainstream Jewish representative organization and community - from religious to secular, community organizations, campus organizations, etc sees them largely as despicable.",comment,-9

Almost everyone clowned the encampment and the usual boycotts, as it was very counter productive which made the case for pro-Palestine side even worse. Optics matter, and sometimes, not taking a side in a conversation is better for both of the sides.

Outside of online and Arab circles, the sentiment isn't what you think it is. Arabs have an uphill PR battle to fight, especially after Hamas's attacks. The support for Hamas within Palestine and Arab world doesn't make it better, as the knee-jerk reaction will always be ""ok, we don't really care about people if they support the terrorists"".

I'm not an Israeli, nor Arab, nor have Jewish roots, but no matter how much people say ""but people are being bombed to death!"", supermajority of the world won't care. Most people think if people in Palestine really wanted peace, they should surrender, just like how it happened in the previous large-scale wars. They're obviously not going to win it against Israel's military complex. You can say ""why not Ukraine?"", well, Ukraine has support and is holding up.

She does still struggle with the term genocide. That word carries a lot of weight for many in the Jewish community for obvious reasons.

I think realistically a two state solution is the only realistic outcome, and requires land swaps and the pullback of many of the existing settlements. Realistically though, Palestine and many of the surrounding Arab states need to come to the table for realistic peace talks, and unlimited right to return and 1967 borders will NEVER be agreed upon by Israel, nor should it.

Center/Center-left 30+ demographics. Mostly 2nd or 3rd+ gen Canadians, of different demographics (east and south asian, white, arab, jews and etc.).

\> But I think overall, the PR is the least of ppls worries

Well, if we want Palestinians to be free, we need the PR machine to win in the West. Anything that'll be done ""against western cultural norms"" will be used against them forever and ever. Most people, other than Muslims and Jewish people, don't think about this conflict unless it pops up in the news and comes up in a conversation. We have about 1.5 million or so muslims and maybe half a million jews in Canada. So, you have to do the whole PR battle to win over the general opinion. Otherwise the whole ""divestment and weapon embargo"" calls are futile.

I think, a lot of people really underestimate how important the whole ""don't bring your problems into our country"" is to an average person as well. Jews  have integrated much more in Canada (sure, you can say they're more white-passing, but it is what it is), so they just have more soft power. Anytime when there's a big protest, loud calls for anything Islam  or hate related, points are taken away. Next time when they call for something actually good (stopping the war), the opposing side will use another excuse, but will be taken more seriously.

It's actually not just Arabs vs Jews things, to be honest. It's just the very obvious thing we see nowadays. During my UofT times, there was a huge unspoken hate mongering between 2nd generation Korean/Japanese and newcomer Chinese. Even worse in Markham and other areas of the city. But they also played the PR game to not to get into headlines, because both sides know it's a long-term losing battle.

\> Even Mississaugas mayor out here saying “a terrorist to you isn’t a terrorist to someone else”

Look at Mississauga's demographics.

Anyways, it's a very not-black-and-white issue. Taking a hard stance on either side is stupid. Both sides suck, Israel right now, sucks more. But ruling side of Palestine should also understand the limit of sacrificing your own people, and give up.",comment,-1

The current geography makes a clear border challenging but it’s doable.

Her and I both think calling for a single state solution in either case right now isn’t connected to reality. There is too much of an ideological divide and baked in hatred for one another. It would never result in peace. 

And any single state solution involved expelling either Israelis or Palestinians is obviously also not tenable and will result in a global refugee crisis.

Jews have lived in coexistence with Christian’s and Muslims for years. There has always been a Jewish presence in Palestine. 

The issue is when Zionists started to come (and were welcomed btw), they got greedy and wanted to take over the land for themselves. 

What you refer to in your arguments, is Zionists extremists who used terrorism like the bombing of the king David hotel to push for the creation of Israel. The UN rewarded terrorism by giving land that was 100% shared between majority Christian and Muslim Palestinians to a group that was only 30% of the population. Note they received about 52% of the land, while not making a third of the population.

Your second argument saying that Arabs today would attack Jews. 
Buddy, Arabs aren’t against Jews, there are Jews who have visited Gaza in humanitarian efforts between conflicts who have said they were treated with nothing but kindness. Arabs hate Zionists and ppl who push the Zionist agenda.

Zionists can be anyone, Jewish Christian Muslim. For example: Biden is a Zionist while not being Jewish. Whereas Ofer Cassif is a member of the Israeli government who is ANTI Zionist and Jewish. Arabs would treat one of these men with great respect and spoiler alert, it’s not Biden.

So saying shit like “Arabs would treat Jews like shit today” nah bro, they would treat Zionists with the same respect Zionists have treated them for the last 75 years.",comment,2

Your actions to excuse one side and completely focus on the other are either the actions of the ignorant, or someone who knows better and is lying. The 100+ years of rising tensions in the Levant will not be solved by escalating only on one side.

As for the history these Jews were not Zionists in the way that you would define the word.

I never claimed that there hadn’t been Jewish extremism, I literally say it was a cycle of violence on both sides. You however dismiss the Arab violence. 

As for the land a lot of the land given was not yet useful land (much was desert). 

Finally saying that Jews today would be treated well is wrong.

Zionists wanted Jewish supremacy and thus had to create Israel out of Palestine. Funny part is, Zionism was very unpopular till the holocaust.

I mean the Arab violence was a response to Zionists. If they hadn’t pushed for taking over the land for themselves and agreed to live in coexistence then the violence wouldn’t have existed in the first place.

Even if it was dessert, it was still inhabited by people who had roots going back generations. 

Why would Jews live in Gaza? A place that the Israeli government bombs every 3 years for fun? Their politicians literally call it “mowing the lawn”. That argument is synonymous to saying “why can’t I live in a prison yard?”
If Jews lived in Gaza, they would have a high chance of being killed by bombs or IDF soldiers over any anti semetic idiot who would harm them.

Finally, I am not a fan of Iran. But I’m also not gonna act like everything I’m told of them is true. Governments lie to propagandize ppl to follow a narrative.

As for the popularity of Zionism (by which I mean a right for Jewish people to have a home land). Before the rise of nazis (1930s) there was still migration into the area. Even if I grant you that it wasn’t popular I think it’s absolutely fair to have it gain traction when your people are being prosecuted which eventually led to the holocaust.

The desert comment was to point out that stating the percentage of the land without context is disingenuous. 

The Haavara agreement while unpopular at the time. It would be a long shot to say it sold out the people considering the impeding holocaust. 

As for Jews living in Gaza, the Hamas charter advocated for the destruction of Israel and its people. Obviously no one wants to live in a war zone but even in peace times they wouldn’t be treated well. As for the conditions of the war itself well it’s not great I put more of the blame onto Hamas (human shields etc). Israel while not a perfect fighting force they still make efforts to protect civilians (while Hamas doesn’t). Israel makes phone calls to buildings drops leaflets among other things.

As for Iran I’m sure you can find testimony of it being well. I can equally find the opposite. But the fact still remains not many live there and the population has been declining since the 80s. 

I appreciate the conversation but we could back forever.",comment,1
