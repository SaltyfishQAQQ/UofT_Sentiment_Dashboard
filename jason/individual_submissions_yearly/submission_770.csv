Applying as an international student (United States),shoe_geek16,1gks7yt,https://i.redd.it/85rpd1n288zd1.jpeg,1730875013.0,"So I’m applying as an international student, and on the application, there aren’t any essays, or additional info text boxes. For the activities section, the word count is also extremely small, so I can’t describe any of my activities. I just wanted to make sure that I’m using the right app (I found it on the website) and that I’m not missing anything, cos for US universities there is sooo much writing. Any help is massively appreciated. Also I’m applying to the Physical Sciences program if that matters at all.",submission,22

You truly don’t have to write a thing unless you’re applying to CS or Rotman, which you mentioned you’re not. Just list activities in a few words, they’re only looking at your high school grades. Good luck!!",comment,3

Heads up some colleges at UofT will disqualify you from FAFSA: these would be St Mikes and Trinity as they are religiously affiliated colleges. If you expect to use FAFSA apply to any college but those two. 

Also another heads up, 10 year ago UofT did not accept super scores for SATs/ACTs so be prepared to send all exams taken. Not sure if this is the case still.",comment,3

Think of it like the CommonApp catchall for all the universities present in Toronto (UWaterloo, UofT, Western, Brock, Algoma, etc). You don't put your grades or your activities in here, just your basic student data as well as your diversity data. 

After you pay the application fees, the University takes upto 5 days to process those fees and responds with your unique username and password (in the UofT, this is your JOINid) and you can log in to the University specific portal. For the UofT, there are essays for the college you want to go to in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences and the Engineering has a video-recorded response. Once you log on to the **university portal**, it'll show everything you need to do. 

Just a heads-up, the UofT doesn't offer financial aid to international students so really think about how you're going to pay for it if you get in.",comment,1

Super bummed that I couldn’t vote in it. I was planning on applying here anyway, but now I have all the more reason to go if I get in. I know most of my friends are trying to leave too. And even though I couldn’t vote, I would like to offer a formal apology on behalf of all Americans for electing that pos again.",comment,6

Well that’s nice at least, for University of California I have to write 4 essays that are each 400 words! I’m applying to UBC too and they have 2 essays which isn’t too bad. For this app tho there’s not even space for description tbh, the cap is like 3 words. I have a 3.9 GPA unweighted, and a 4.5 GPA weighted (not sure how the Canadian hs grade scale is) but for the US that’s an A average. So I’m feeling confident just wasn’t sure I was at the right portal. Thanks!",comment,8

And for the SAT it’s test optional, so I wasn’t sure if I was even gonna send any scores.

gpa scaling depends on every school and province, but it sounds like you're pretty much the best you could possibly be lol. i'd be confident too! good luck in your application :)",comment,1
