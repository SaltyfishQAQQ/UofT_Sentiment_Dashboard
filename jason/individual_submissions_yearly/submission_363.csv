Should I try to talk to a girl I find attractive in my class?,Successful_Goose_727,1gqzapu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gqzapu/should_i_try_to_talk_to_a_girl_i_find_attractive/,1731568144.0,"Just want to preface by saying I‚Äôm aware that this post is gonna sound cringe so I apologize in advance.

There‚Äôs this cute girl in one of my classes that I really want to talk to but I don‚Äôt really know how to or if it‚Äôs even a good idea at all. The thing is that she sits kinda far away from me and everyone pretty much has set seats that they sit at atp and she tends to always sit next to this other girl so I can‚Äôt really randomly go sit next to her bc that would just be weird. I was thinking of maybe trying to approach/talk to her one time after class as we‚Äôre walking out. But then idk if I should tell her I think she‚Äôs cute and ask if she‚Äôd be down to grab coffee or just ask her something about class. The latter is obviously more natural but I also feel like if I‚Äôm not direct about the fact that I‚Äôm interested in her it might just end up as a one time convo and then I wouldn‚Äôt know where to go from there.
I realize it probably would‚Äôve been better to try to talk to her in class closer to the beginning of the semester in a casual/friendly way first to gauge if she‚Äôd be open to talking to me in general, but I didn‚Äôt do that unfortunately and now there‚Äôs only 2 weeks left in the sem so I feel like I‚Äôd have to be more direct about it.
I‚Äôve looked for similar questions that have been asked in this and other subreddits and there doesn‚Äôt really seem to be a consensus as to whether or not it‚Äôs an acceptable thing to do. I understand that it can be annoying for women to be approached all the time and I definitely don‚Äôt want to make her uncomfortable or make her feel creeped out or anything. Tbh normally I would never do something like this but I‚Äôm in my final year at uoft and I‚Äôm kinda feeling like I should just do it because you only live once and all that. Any advice is appreciated üôè ",submission,70
