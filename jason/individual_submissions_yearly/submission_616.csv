They won't let me pass on to the next year because I was about 1 percent away from a clear standing,1uvatoronto,1f5ata7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f5ata7/they_wont_let_me_pass_on_to_the_next_year_because/,1725064723.0,"Hi people

I wanted to shed some light on an issue I'm currently facing. I'm an engineering student who's been actively involved on campus, and up until my second year, second semester, my grades were fairly average. However, I encountered difficulties that led to failing two courses for the first time in my academic career. Since the sessional average for those courses was below 55%, I was placed directly into the second stage of academic probation, requiring me to withdraw for 8 months. During that time, I found work and studied for those courses in my free time. This is 2023

When I returned and retook the courses, I put in a significant effort—I attended every tutorial, completed every problem set, sought help from TAs, and studied with friends. Going into the final exams, I was on track to clear my standing with an average above 60%. However, one course brought my sessional average down to 58.5%, so 1.5% short. Initially, I was told to withdraw from engineering, which led me to petition, explaining the circumstances that affected my performance. Now, I've been informed that I must withdraw for another 8 months and retake the same courses yet again.

This situation is incredibly frustrating. I've already invested so much time, effort, and resources into my degree. I’ve made great friends, many of whom have now moved on to their third year and co-op. It's been tough to rebuild those connections during my second attempt at these courses, and now I'm facing the prospect of doing it all over again with no familiar faces.

What doesn't make sense to me is why I can't move on to my third year and retake only the courses where I scored below 60%. I've passed the courses in my chosen streams with grades above 60%, which shows that I enjoy and excel in those subjects. It feels like the current policies are more focused on financial gain than on supporting students through challenging times. I'm already halfway through my degree, and the thought of another year spent redoing the same courses is disheartening.

I'm currently in the appeal process, but my advisor has indicated that it might take months, meaning the fall semester is quickly approaching.

My main question is: Why can't I progress to my third year while retaking only the specific courses I need to improve? I've shown that I can succeed in my stream courses, and I believe I deserve the chance to continue while addressing the areas where I fell short.

I dont know if I should transfer to another program or just another university overall and take the transfer credits.

Any advice or support would be greatly appreciated.

Best regards,

If you are still set on staying in engineering, try to look at this experience as objectively as possible - what led to it, what can you change in your life to prevent this from happening again, etc. If this experience is causing you to question if engineering is for you, that is okay as well- take the time to listen to your thoughts, **but don't base your decision solely on your grades - try to join design teams or get an internship if you haven't already**. Engineering degrees are notoriously hard for everyone, you don't have to quit when things are hard. If this is still something you want to do, pursue it.  I was struggling a lot in first year and i remember thinking if pursing engineering was a mistake - I was talking to my linear algebra prof about another course i was struggling in one day after class and he literally was like ""dont let Prof \*redacted\* tell you you cant be an engineer if this what you want to do"" I'm glad I listened because it got easier and I am sure it will get easier for you too.

Also ppl in these comments are unnecessarily harsh. Academic success is not a great determinator for your future success as an engineer. There is so much more to engineering than the 5-6 courses they make us take; you need soft skills, practical skills, experience, etc that a grade will never show.  It's not like you failed all of your courses -it's normal to not be good every single course in your program and no one is good at or at least  enjoys every single thing in their careers either.

I understand it's very confusing and disappointing when you try your best and you still don't get the results you wanted. It is not the end of the world. There's the extra added feeling of loss bc you paid for courses too (and uoft scams the hell out of engineering students), but still it is not the end of the world- you are still a student and have time to turn things around if this is what you really want. And you are 100% justified in feeling like it's stupid that you have to redo the courses you did well in-several unis and programs have these odd, unnecessary policies that are money grabs - for example, nursing students in Ryerson have to retake their entire year if they fail a single course- I met one who had to do this, but they became a successful nurse after graduating and passing their NCLEX. You are not alone in this feeling and I'm sure there are more students who are in the same situation as you are right now.

You sound like a resilient, hard worker; you are continuing to work for your future despite setbacks, so I am sure you can put this behind yourself and find success.",comment,5

If you can't own up to your shortcomings you'll never be able to improve on them, and this whole post is worded to try and shift blame away from yourself.


> However, I encountered difficulties that led to failing two courses for the first time in my academic career


This is a long way to say ""I failed two courses"". Notice how you don't actually say that though, you didn't *fail*, you were *led to failing for the first time* apparently.


> However, one course brought my sessional average down to 58.5%, so 1.5% short


No one course affects your average more than any other, so logically this makes no sense. Maybe it was a stats course you failed? Your average is below the minimum, and your average is your responsibility, it's not the result of one rogue course or something.



> I've passed the courses in my chosen streams with grades above 60%, which shows that I enjoy and excel in those subjects.


This part genuinely makes me think this is a troll post LOL. 60% is not excelling, it's barely passing. Don't be ridiculous.



The rest of the post is just unremarkable whining. You should either switch programs or own up to your mistakes, no other options.",comment,14

It really means a lot, especially knowing that you have faced your own struggles and pushed through. 

  
I've been questioning whether engineering is the right path for me, but as you said, it's important not to base that decision solely on grades. I've been involved in design teams and some practical internships and those experiences have kept me motivated. It's encouraging to hear that it does get easier and others more to engineering than just the academic side. 

To bring up another point, the third year is when all the courses get more exciting. It's more applicable and practical in contrast to the heavy theory-based subjects in the first and second years. 

I also wish I had known to withdraw from the course I was struggling with the first time around. If I had done that I could have saved my gpa. Some of my friends withdrew as soon as they realized the semester was becoming too much. I wish I had done the same.

  
Thanks again for your support and encouragement",comment,2
