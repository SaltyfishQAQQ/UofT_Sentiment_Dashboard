What do you do when you get stuck and how do you get over the hurdle of not knowing what is being emphasized in class?

On another post that was posted recently, someone commented that they got a 4.0 by not going to class and studying at their own pace. I'm not on the same level academically as this student but I really resonate with the idea that class time is really wasted on me. I am not processing or comprehending anything most of the time because the content moves pretty fast, especially when I'm unfamiliar with what is being said. I'm just in a mad rush to write everything on the board down, and at this point I ask permission to record lectures on my phone because I don't expect to grasp what the professor is saying in the moment. My real learning takes place when I can sit down by myself and relisten to the recording and read the textbook slowly.

Especially when you don't have past exams for that specific professor, what makes you confident in your ability to succeed without going to class? How do you know you aren't spending lots of time going over something that won't be on the test?

I'm also afraid that when you don't go to class or tutorials something breaks in your relationship with the professor and/or TAs, and your questions become a nuisance because you ""don't come to class"". When you don't go to class, do you still try to go to office hours and ask questions on Piazza? Do you completely forego that and go to Reddit or stack overflow for your questions?

I think I'm still probably going to go because I like having personal recordings (with permission of course) to work from, but I'd really appreciate others insights on this.",submission,68

Especially not when you're making recordings during class.  Be as mentally and emotionally present in class as you can, take skeletal notes (which you can flesh out after class), and ask questions during class, however ""stupid"" you think the question may be.

Asking questions allows the instructor to better understand where the students actually are with their understanding.  If no-one asks questions, it's easy (and comfortable) to imagine that this is because students are doing great.  You don't want to ask tons of questions but asking one or two questions per class should be perfectly fine.  And you can ask tons of questions after class, in drop-in hours, and so forth.

Here's an article about note-taking and why skeletal notes are better for learning than transcript-type notes.  TLDR: skeletal notes require you to identify and compress key things and later decompress and build them up.  This uses your brain and makes the understanding yours.  Trasnscript-type notes are passive, the notetaker isn't using their brain (as much) when taking them and doesn't use their brain (as much) when reading them.

There are lots of approaches to notetaking, perhaps look into these and try a few out (while watching a youtube video, for example) and see what seems to work better for you?

Please don't be seduced by the existence of students who never go to class and yet do great.  They're the exception and you're hearing survivorship bias.  The thousands of students who never went to class and dropped out aren't speaking up.

If the everyone-get-into-a-room-and-try-to-learn-stutff-together model wasn't the one that works best for most people, universities wouldn't have been continuing for centuries.  Another way to put it: if the oh-just-learn-it-on-your-own-here's-some-stuff model was the one that works the best for most people, why did online learning during covid times suck so much?  Why did so many students fail to master the things they would otherwise have mastered and why are they having such a hard time now with the lost years of learning?

Also, you don’t need to take notes on everything. I used to use my notes in class to get down definitions of key words, and then with the rest I tried to rewrite what the slides said in my own words so I understood it.

Sadly, not knowing what was emphasized and missing in-class participation did hurt my grades significantly.

I was an extreme case, though. I remember Abstract Algebra 2. There were five exams in total. The lowest one was dropped, and the rest were worth 25% each. I never attended class. I skipped one exam on purpose and accidentally missed the other one. I got perfect marks on the other three exams. This led to a 75% that was rounded up to an 80 (per the rules of my university).

At some point, I realized I had to improve my GPA  to get into a good PhD program. So, I started attending class even if I was bored to death. I did a lot of doodling. I practiced callygraphy.

This is admittedly more doable if the instructor posts materials before hand, but most courses follows some text book and it's fairly easy to figure out the chapters being covered from the syllabus.
In terms of learning style I'm very old school: ""go to lecture, jot down notes, read textbook, do homework"" type of guy so YMMV but I find note taking to be very crucial in keeping me engaged in lectures. One can practice quick writing/minute keeping such that it doesn't take up any mental effort to keep up with the instructor, thereby freeing up the mental capacity to learn and comprehend the course material (my hand and eye is kinda doing its own thing autonomously while I'm listening to lectures).

But I will reiterate that the point of what I said in my comment was not to recommend not going to lectures, but rather to find a method of learning that is most efficient for you. 

The reason why I personally didn’t go to lectures was based on my own empirical experiences in my first two years, where I found that I generally achieved much higher scores in semesters where I did not attend classes as often. I will add that I am a commuter who saves 2-3 hours a day by not going on campus so keep that in your consideration. I will maintain that my method is not going to work for the vast majority of people, it requires a good amount of time management and a great amount of self discipline to not fall behind.

And as the comment by u/Fauxangel2069 has highlighted, you may also run into instructors who are sticklers for attendance who will disadvantage you for not attending their lectures. 

My point is that the most important thing is to understand the way you learn, and not neglect your lectures if that’s the way you learn and keep up with content best. Anecdotally, in my cohort, I know only one other person who doesn’t attend classes and still maintained a high 3.9 GPA throughout all 4 years, and maybe 10 or so that attended lectures regularly that achieved very high (3.9+) GPAs.",comment,5

Why are you in a mad rush to write everything down?

> My real learning takes place when I can sit down by myself and relisten to the recording and read the textbook slowly.

If your real learning takes place when you can sit down, listen to a lecture, and slowly read over the textbook, then lean into that.

Come into class, set your phone to record, and sit back to enjoy the presentation. You are being lectures by an expert in the field, who understands this topic inside and out. If you know that you'll eventually take the time to sit down and review it in detail later, then instead use your lecture time to simply enjoy the fruits of their labor. It you do, it should make understanding the textbook easier in the future.

You can still write stuff down. If there's a really cool insight that you want to remember, jot it down. You don't need the entire blackboard for it. Just write it down in text form. Something like ""Holy shit, you can use this formula for this situation, but that formula for that situation, that's cool,"" is going to tell you more than having both the formulas written down on a page with a small label highlighting the most useful part, which you might just miss later.

>  breaks in your relationship with the professor and/or TAs, and your questions become a nuisance because you ""don't come to class"". 

I mean... This is their job. Even people that go to class might completely misunderstand something that they heard. Office hours exist for the prof and TAs to answer questions that people don't get. Why should you care if they consider it a nuisance? They're getting paid to do it, so whether they think you're god's gift to humanity, or a total slacker is besides the point. Would you avoid going to a restaurant because you might be a nuisance to the wait stuff for not understanding the menu?

> For students who make the choice to not attend class. What do you do when you get stuck and how do you get over the hurdle of not knowing what is being emphasized in class?

If you really want to go in this direction, the simple answer is you deal with it.

When you get out into the real world and there's a problem you have not encountered, you won't have a prof to guide you to the answer. Figuring it out will be on your shoulders. University isn't really that different. The things you are being tested on are generally skills that you're expected to learn, not necessarily minutia that you recall. Knowing the minutia of what any particular exam is about can improve your chances, but so can simply understanding the material. Your prof isn't going to ask you to solve some unsolved problem of the field on the exam. You're just going to be asked questions that a professional in this area should be able to answer without much difficulty.

Simply put, if you learn everything that's taught in class, you don't have to worry about what's being emphasized, because you will already know it as part of all the other things you learn. 

Is it possible that you'll spend a lot of time on something that isn't on the test? It sure is. However, if it's something that really takes this much time then there's a good chance that learning it will help you understand the other content in a more comprehensive way. That's what it means to take your education into your own hands.

The key lesson here is that the product of your time in university is not the grades on your exams. Those grades are something you'll use once or twice in your life when you're applying to grad school, or when you're getting your first job out of university. After that point the only thing you keep from your university education is your knowledge and understanding of the world. With that in mind, you should spend your time in university trying to use everything and everyone available to improve your understanding of the world that you will carry into the rest of your life, even if that means sometimes learning stuff that won't be on the test. 

If you do this, you'll find your exam grades are probably going to go up, because being a more well-rounded person will give you more ways to approach problems. You can do this on your own, while staying at home and reading a book, or you can do this in a learning environment surrounded by your peers and your mentors. The latter is generally quite a bit easier, if you aren't stuck with social anxiety or something of the like. Meanwhile the former can be fun in it's own right, as long as you're willing to fully shoulder the responsibility for learning the things you must to learn. It's not an option for the faint of heart, that's for sure, but it is possible if you have the capacity.",comment,2

Some classes you can find a solutions manual for your textbook (or check quizlet, numerade, etc.) then try problems and if you can’t do it you can then check the solutions which will be extremely beneficial because your brain is already primed. You’ll fly through problems this way, but you have to make sure you try to think seriously about the problem before seeing the solution. That’s far superior to lectures for learning procedural tasks.

Did skip quite a few classes, but I think it optimized my overall results.

To be clear, where the professor gave decent lectures that helped accelerate my overall learning, definitely did attend.  But, for some professors who I clearly did not connect with at all in terms of learning style* (and would be much faster just learning on my own), just made sure to know what topics and types of examples were covered in class (from other classmates who were attending), and made sure to keep up on my own.  

(*YMMV, but to this day, I am very much breadth first thinker for learning and work organization, and get easily lost when people dive into deep details without first establishing a framework and context. It was truly much more efficient for me to learn on my own, for classes taught in this latter way.)

It's all about time optimization -- what's the best way to use each hour of the day?  If I found it more useful to be doing other things (e.g. working on a large lab, project, job applications, etc.) during the scheduled class time, and then catch up later, then so be it.  Do be honest with yourself if you do this, though. I.e. Don't be absolutely bound to the dogma that one must strictly attend all classes to succeed.  But also, only allow yourself to skip classes if you *really* are being more productive, and don't use it as some flimsy rationalization if that's not actually the case.

Good luck!",comment,1

I rarely attended class in my CS undergrad. However, I did a minor in philosophy, where I did attend almost every class.

CS (and math) are probably among the easiest subjects to self study, and a lot is practice. Concepts are well explained online and in textbooks, and for studying doing exercises is vastly more important than listening or memorizing.

Philosophy was often discussion based and the point is much more to learn how to argue in these discussions. It’s less about how right or wrong what you say is objectively, but whether your argumentation strategy is sound. That’s harder to recognize when just studying by yourself.

In all of my classes, I did spend the whole time I was not in class still on campus, mostly doing homework or discussing class material with friends. And most of those friends were other top students who really wanted to learn. Not in a desperate “I need an A to get into FAANG” way, but in a “I just genuinely love talking about this subject” way. So a lot of our conversations naturally were about classes, concepts, etc. I found that I needed to engage in material actively, by working through problems and talking to people about it, often trying to help others with their homework. Passively listening in class just didn’t give me any benefit, so I didn’t. Piazza and OHs are ways of engaging actively, so I did use them when it seemed useful to me.

The important takeaway is: as long as you engage with the material, you can learn. Many people who don’t go to class and fail simply don’t substitute the class time with other meaningful activities. But the whole point of university is to figure out how to study extremely challenging material in a self directed way. Experiment with ways of studying and find one that works. Look for people who match your level of excitement for the material. Try skipping a class and see if you can still catch up. But be honest with yourself and go back if it doesn’t work for you.

I’m a PhD student now and for most things I encounter, there is no mandatory class. So having learned how to study content by myself is one of the most useful skills I have taken away from my undergrad.",comment,1

After speaking to many professors during office hours, it becomes clear that they value student attendance, especially in smaller classes. With almost every job requiring references, good luck getting one if your prof has never seen your face. 


So even if you have a 4.0, you’ve lost valuable reference letters, networking and friendship opportunities. Similarly, profs sometimes “attendance check” in non-mandatory attendance courses by holding special in-class review sessions where they might give you like 20% of the exam answers on the slides. 


So you’re absolutely right about your worries and concerns.",comment,1

I'm a student who had a 1.7 in first year and eventually had 3.7-4.0s in my last three years.

I may have developed slightly OCD tendencies too, because like you OP, I became obsessed with recording and making sure I got every tiny note down. Truly like a court stenographer. Many people were surprised when I told them that I 'studied' 12+ hours a day in first year, compared to 2-3+ from second to fifth year, but my grades were much better when I 'studied' less. This is because most of my time in first year was spent listening to recordings, and subsequent years were more focused on just paying attention in class and then simply reviewing afterwards.

Much like what u/BabaYagaTO said, transcribing notes feels closer to passive studying. Skeletal notes are much more active, because you are consciously choosing the big ideas. You will miss smaller details here and there, but this also frees up room to connect the main ideas and 'see' the big picture (like an instant mind map in your head). But this is also why I recommend students to review their lectures at home immediately after class to fill in some of those smaller ideas before you forget them. In a nutshell, paying attention in class is extremely important. *Understanding* the material will also make it much more easier to *memorize* the smaller details. Active learning is more tiring for sure, but I also find it way more efficient at the end of the day, when combining all of the hours.

Secondly, in regards to physics/math/maybe a bit of chemistry, understanding is truly the key aspect. Biology, I've found that you can get by if you just want to memorize (though I think it's pretty hellish if you don't understand any of it). One way to get better at physics and math though is also through a lot of practice. You can catch where you're doing something wrong, and further build those connections in your head every time you understand why certain things behave in a particular way. My understanding isn't as strong as my memorization skills, unfortunately, but physics/chemistry/math have the benefit of practice problems that allows for you to test your understanding constantly.

Lastly, to your point about skipping class—while I'm sure that's true for some students, I personally have never missed a class (or an office hour) or a tutorial since I was in first year. In fact, I sat in the front row, in the middle (I know, I know) and asked one or two questions each class. Guess who remembers me 3+ years after graduating?",comment,21

I feel like for classes where the content is more fact-based and I understand the language being used writing less is really helpful. 

I'm a STEM student and I've found that for math classes specifically and to some extent physics and stats classes- the way language is used in those classes is really important so much so that I focus on the way words are used in those classes way more than any humanities/humanities-adjacent course I've taken.

When I'm introduced with new ideas when taking those classes, because I don't understand what is being said and I can't think about what's being said in the moment (I can't think and listen to challenging content at the same time or else I won't hear what's being said next). I don't trust myself to accurately identify the important ideas that need to be written down correctly. I've found that later on with not verbatim notes I'm missing key context that make other ideas click that was said in class, but of course because I didn't write everything down, I have to rederive it for myself or hope it doesn't end up on a test.

In terms of questions, I'm definitely not afraid of asking the stupid ones, but for more challenging courses I find I get into a space where the question becomes: ""I understand that all the words you used were in English, but I'm not able to extract meaning from any of the sentences that were just said. Individually I know what the words mean, but together they went right over my head. Please repeat and rephrase."" But obviously you can't bog down a class with that, so before I had audio recordings I just suffered in silence and hoped that by writing down all of the words I could understand them later.

Because I finally broke down and realized I need audio recordings, I'm not as panicked about missing the information anymore. Now my focus is making sure I write what the profs draw/write on the board accurately so I can line it up with the recordings when I'm going over the material more in-depth later.",comment,7

I've been toying with the idea in my mind and I haven't gone through with it for some of the reasons you presented.

In my mind, I'm paying to learn the information and get the best grades possible by any means necessary, whether that means I'm in class or not. Up until now I've prioritized building relationships and showing up without really considering other possibilities because it's just what I've always done. Hence, this post.

What I have alluded to in the post and in other comments is that I really struggle with processing information orally in real-time. I am signed up with accessibility services etc. but it doesn't change the way university is delivered.

I guess a way of describing it is, have you ever been in a car with someone who needs to turn down the radio in the car to see where they're driving? Now if we take that situation to the classroom, it's hard to read/see the board while listening to the professor, it's hard to listen to the professor and write what's being said, and it's hard to think about what's being said while listening to the professor, which leads to a giant mess of nothing being done well. It feels like I have one focus token and I have to choose where it goes and I'm always losing out. Or I'm a single-threaded machine that is being treated like they're supposed to be multi-threaded.

Waste of time is definitely not what I'd say, but I'm getting less out of the experience than other students for sure.",comment,1
