Why is the athletic center steam room closed? Staff didn't give answer,PrincipleStrict3216,1efixlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1efixlf/why_is_the_athletic_center_steam_room_closed/,1722308733.0,"For the longest time I thought we had a steam room at the rec centre. Yesterday I went to try it and the thing is fully closed off. Asked around and apparently it's been like that for years. I asked some of the athletic center staff when it will be fixed, and they got really defensive and said there is no plan?

Anyone know what's up? Having a sauna on campus would be dope and I see no reason the university doesn't have the money for it. It happily spends millions on random vanity projects. 

For reference it's between the showers and rmr of the locker room (men's side). You make a right entering the showers from the locker room and keep going. ",submission,17

I suspect the AC staff are trying to cover up the fact they just don't feel like going through the process of fixing it rather than being unable to. With how many staff they have it's really annoying.,comment,0

You can literally see a bunch of their employees watching netlfix by the registration counter (why do we even have two counters?). The rec center is wayyy overstaffed. The University is building a ton of new buildings and spends a comedic amount to maintain roads, parking garages etc. It can afford the maybe few thousand every few years to fix a steam room. It's literally one of the best ways to reduce stress. 

  
Thanks for sharing",comment,2
