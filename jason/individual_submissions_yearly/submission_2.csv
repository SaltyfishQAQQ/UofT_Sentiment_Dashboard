i started at 2:00pm and arrived exactly 24 hours later. i only took only small breaks, almost never more than half an hour. my longest break was at 6:00am for a one hour nap. 

although mcmaster is only 66km from uoftsg (where i live), i made a slight detour to uoftm so the total distance walked was 80km. i resisted all temptation to hitckhike or take a bus, i just walked the whole way with nothing but my phone, a water bottle which i would refill anywhere that was open 24/7 and radiohead. riveting experience, but i’m never doing this again, i can’t walk properly anymore without a massive limp.",submission,1835

another highlight was the time between 1:00am and 5:00am when there was not a single car or person around. i was just walking alone in oakville with nobody around for miles. that felt great.

oh yeah, another highlight was when i suddenly felt a massive pang of guilt for not brushing my teeth. i walked into a walmart and bought a toothbrush and toothpaste and brushed my teeth while walking on the highway. the people who passed by me looked at me as if i was mentally ill",comment,90
