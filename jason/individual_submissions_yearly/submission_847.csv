For some reason UofT also calls it Quercus. 

To get access, on the webpage, search up ""Quercus"" and log in with your UTORid. And on your phone you should download the Canvas app and login with your UTORid as well.

On there you will* find your courses; the interface is similar to Google classroom. 

*You probably won't see your courses now cuz most professors haven't published their course page.",comment,22
SYLLABUS? HOW TO PREPARE FOR FIRST WEEK AS A FIRST YEAR,AmbitiousHonesty,lhy2p85,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1eravx5/syllabus_how_to_prepare_for_first_week_as_a_first/lhy2p85/,1723572090.0,"Took some time to type this down as I myself was completely lost in my first year first week.

To prepare for the first week (assuming you can access the course page already), I suggest reading through the syllabus and familiarizing yourself with the Quercus page.

1. Things I do as I read through the syllabus:

* Take note of important dates (midterms, deadlines) and mark them onto the calendar.
* I have a Google spreadsheet to keep track of my marks in each course. I set it up as I read through the syllabus. I create a chart with the assessments \[quizzes, problem sets, attendance, midterms exams, etc.\] and marks ditributed to each item. And I set up spreadsheet formulas so that throughout the semester I can input my actual marks and it will calculate my current course mark right away. Do note that some courses have curving, though.
* Devise a goal and know what to let go. For example, I am more of a theory person, so I set myself to work harder for problem sets and exams (e.g. aiming for 80-90%) and less for labs (e.g. aiming for 60-70%); these collectively set my mark goal for the course. Also, once you know the marking scheme, you know what to let go first (e.g. quizzes with little associated mark) when you are very busy. A big difference between high school and uni is that in uni you get so busy and most likely you'll have to let go some stuff.
* Set up and know the platforms or textbooks required for that course. Unlike high school, you'll have a bunch of online platforms (Crowdmark, Gradescope.ca, Gradescope.com, Piazza, etc.) in uni. Different professors prefer different platforms so you'll find it complicated at first. As for textbooks (some are supplementary and some are necessary for doing marked problem sets), like the other comment said, oftentimes you don't need it or you'll know where it's cheaper in the first lecture, so you might not want to buy them too fast. But make sure you get them in the first few weeks. Buying online textbooks is quite complicated so you don't want to leave them till you get busy with homework.
* Get an idea of the main topics and aims of the course (e.g. what major questions we're answering by the end of each chapter) so that you don't get lost throughout the semester. By doing so, you'll also know if you actually like the course or should drop it. Sometimes the course descriptions on the academic calendar are not that informative and people realize mid-semester that the course is not what they wanted (e.g. too computational or too theoretical).
* Get an idea of lecture and tutorial formats; know what to expect. Sometimes lectures are professors teaching the theory; sometimes lectures are professors doing practice questions and you have to learn the theory yourself before the lecture (e.g. reading the textbooks).
* Get an idea of homework formats (e.g. this paper is 500 words, that one is 1000 words). Know what to expect.
* Know the course policies on extensions, grace periods, late penalties, missed midterms, etc. You'll need them someday.
* Finally, devise weekly plans and set up things that you can set up now. After reading through syllabi for all courses, I create a list of tasks I need to do each week (e.g. preview AAAxxx textbook, do BBByyy problem sets, writing CCCzzz weekly essays, etc.). What I mean by setting things up is like note-taking apps, lab report templates, etc.

2. Familiarizing yourself with the Quercus page:

* Some professors have very complicated Quercus pages, with links and shortcuts everywhere, useful and useless ones. Some professors provide a bunch of resources on Quercus and you might have personal preferences for which ones to use. Know the parts on Quercus that you will and will not use before classes start.
* Look through materials for each course. Get an idea how difficult each course is and which courses you'll have to spend more time studying on.
* Print out important document perhaps.
* Start previewing a bit.

In case you haven't, look up how cGPA and GPA work. Sometimes it's good to be strategic.

One other thing I would do is search up professors' websites and see if their research or experiences interest me. If they do, I'll plan to go to office hours to talk about them.

That's all I can think of right now. Good luck and have fun!",comment,23
