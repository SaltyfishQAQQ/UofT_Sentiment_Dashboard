Linear Algebra: 50
Civ100: 45

I haven't had midterms/haven't gotten grades back from my other classes. What do I do...I don't party at all, I study and get 9 hours of sleep I don't understand what I'm doing wrong.

Especially for the CIV midterm, I did all the practice problems and exams and got them correct as I was doing them. For the class problem sets if you made a little mistake that carried through you still got part marks, but it seems they were way less lenient on the exam...

Is this fixable or should i drop out?

Please go see the people in the First Year Office.  They're super-experienced and they're tthere to support you and will have some ideas and suggestions!  [https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/first-year-office-2/first-year-office/](https://undergrad.engineering.utoronto.ca/first-year-office-2/first-year-office/)

Separately, the math courses have office/drop-in hours that you can go to, no matter which instructor's hour it is.  If you're not comfortable talking w/ your own instructor about your exam score you can go to one of the others.  Ask them if they could quickly read over the exam and then give you some birds-eye comments and suggestions and advice.  (birds-eye would be ""you made some arithmetic mistakes and copy errrors, go more slowly?"" not ""you multiplied wrong here"").  You could also do this w/ the civ exam, maybe?",comment,10

They can’t exactly give you part marks if you’re using concepts not even related to the question they have a rubric of what they can and can’t give you.

Idk just my guess but if you’re getting all the practice problems and practice exams right and doing bad on the midterms there’s one of two reasonable things that are happening.
1. You panic and test anxiety gets in the way
2. More likely, you’re doing the practice problems and midterms while looking at the solutions and are building up confidence that you’re a lot better off than you actually are. You think you know how to do it because you look at the solution and understand it but you can’t replicate it at all",comment,4

The questions are similar and it’s a great way to practice. Find all the references books and do the practice questions there. Again there will be similar questions. Always go tutorial and see what everyone is asking. From my dad.,comment,1

I fully understand what you're going through. My first year midterms weren't that great either, calc midterm 1 - 33% and 45% in Lin alg midterm 2. You prob heard this a million times but in hs you're fed every little bit of information and are given weeks to understand/become comfortable w a concept. However something rlly important in uni is learning how to study. Ik for myself being a mainstream ossd student didn't do me any favors when it came to this.After going through every course and reviewing how I studied for every course I found the following:
- civ: it literally doesn't matter if u know the concepts, even tho they teach you the theory. Solving as many problems as you can will help you build up that intuition to tackle a problem in an exam situation when u have limited time. Ik the assignments seem negligible cus they're worth less than. 1%, but rlly putting in a genuine effort goes a long way. 
- 186: unlike civ, the midterms for this course really tests you on if u truly understand the fundamentals. I found the tutorials for this course very helpful as they are essentially part year midterm/exam questions. So before each lecture, actually try the pces for yourself before double checking w someone (or a gc). Something else that helped was after each lecture I would go through some of the assigned hw from the textbook. I forgot to mention that my mark doubled from the first to midterm to the 2nd and, for finals rlly do the past finals. I ended the course w an 86. (Gets more application based towards the end which is what ur tested on for in the final and it gets better trust.)
- 188: also another course I rlly struggled w in the beginning however found that the webworks are almost copied onto the midterms as well as an assignment question. I would say putting in an honest effort, working through all tutorial problems (before a test), and asking for help is the best way to reinforce ur understanding. The final ties together all the concepts you've learned but is mainly calculations. 

Hope this helps, and feel free to message :) goodluck",comment,1
