I missed oweek because of schedule conflicts so i feel like im not as close with people in res like everyone else. I talked to a lot of people in my classes but it was all the same basic introduction, exchanging socials and then it just stopped there. I joined a club but there too, i feel like everyone has their set group of friends already and it‚Äôs just really hard to approach the people and actually get close with(especially as an introvert)
I mean yea it‚Äôs only been 2 weeks of school so i guess it will take a bit of time.. but it really does get lonely when i have no one to study with, no one to talk to, no one to eat with.
Im just feeling doubtful that the right people will come..
How did yall meet your close friends? And was it difficult?",submission,48

A few weeks. Good friends? Much longer than that. For my first year I only had ‚Äúschool friends‚Äù ‚Äì like work friends, where you only hang out during/between class and mostly just talk about your courses. It takes awhile to form actual bonds with people. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll get there :) you just have to make an effort to put yourself out there and (I‚Äôm also an introvert and I‚Äôm socially anxious so I know this is easier said than done) ask people if they want to study together or get coffee before class or walk to the TTC together or whatever. The worst that can happen is they say no, and that won‚Äôt kill you.

If it‚Äôs any consolation I don‚Äôt think people make a lot of friends during orientation. The most it did for me was I knew a few peoples names and faces and when we met again we could say ‚Äúoh hey it‚Äôs you from orientation‚Äù.",comment,14

You're right, it takes time and effort to make friends. It can be hard to approach people but you NEED to do it to make friends. You won't find someone to study with, eat with, hang with overnight. You need to build a relationship with people through frequent and positive interactions before they even consider saying yes to your invites. Just keep trying and you'll eventually find your people.",comment,6

Get their name; ask about their programs and classes; ask them if everything is going well; ask if they‚Äôre from Toronto; etc. If they‚Äôre receptive, then you might want to ask for their contact by the end of the lecture. Send a text every now and then. Start asking if they want to grab some food after class or study or both.

It‚Äôs a very gradual process which can seem daunting, but it‚Äôs so much easier to get started than many people realize. Don‚Äôt obsess over details and don‚Äôt be afraid to put yourself out there.

Good luck!",comment,4

I recommend trying to set up a study group that meets weekly for a class (bonus points if they're people you met in the office hours of one of your classes since they are probably highly motivated).

The people you see talking and with their friend groups now either knew each other from high school, are not as close as they seem, or are the exception, not the rule. I would say bounce around as much as possible until you find just one person who is open and compatible with you, then really just focus on building a friendship with that one person. From there people will be your friend‚Äôs friends and it gets much easier. Shoot a couple messages to the people you exchanged socials with and if they don‚Äôt respond the first two times, drop it. Also res is brutal fs, when I was there people stopped making new friends and saying hi in the hallways 3 days inüíÄSo don‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre alone on this; it‚Äôs tough for a lot of folks.
