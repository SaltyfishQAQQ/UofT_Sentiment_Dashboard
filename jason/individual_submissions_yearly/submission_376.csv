University is much different from HS. Check which concepts you‚Äôre struggling with or need more clarity. Talk to your prof during office hours. I would also recommend booking to see an academic advisor. They have lots of resources to help you get back on track. You‚Äôre still only in first year so there is many more chances for you to redeem yourself. Finals are coming up so I would recommend you doing this soon. Best of luck :),comment,19

But it‚Äôs normal to feel this way in first year. Uni workload is 3x more than hs so it‚Äôll take some time to adjust. Try changing up your study habits and try new strategies.,comment,14

After that I don't care GPA anymore, but still work hard for the test and assignment. Sometime there is something you can't always control, then let it go. My motivation not from the grade, but from completion of each work. Don't compare with others, there is always someone smart and they don't need work hard but get better grade than u. Then find something outside the coursework you want to do, like intern, or volunteer, or your hobbies. You life isn't limited by gpa. 

If you want to apply grads, do more things to make up the GPA part. I accept my GPA failure, but my life can't be affected by the GPA failure.",comment,4

I might‚Äôve not been in the same program, but every program here is tough in its own way so i definitely feel u. It offers from hs so much that scanning the textbook isn‚Äôt enough. As a third year who finally figured it out here‚Äôs some methods that can help: 

A: time blocking
from the time u wake up to the time u want to sleep, time block everything and stay consistent on the schedule. It‚Äôs easy to procrastinate and hard to stay on schedule but hard work wins. So in ur calendar put in the time of ur classes put in the time of ur commute, if u commute. Put in studying and review blocks for specific things. For example my anatomy course it would be STUDY ANA LEC CN‚Äôs instead of STUDY ANA. Be Specific!!! And that extra time u have is for eating, sleeping (get at least 6 hrs), self care, mental counseling (health and wellness get to those appointments and spill ur heart out if ur having a rough time, they help organize ur mind a lot, it doesn‚Äôt even have to be about school), and yk other things like shower bathroom etc. you get the point

B: Summarize your lecture notes.
Your notes for the lecture should fit into 1 page,use both front and back, it should include definitions terms ur equations in the case of math. Figure out an easy to display and study. Take ur time making these notes and go search on online engines for concepts you don‚Äôt understand.

C: PRACTICE THOSE QUESTIONS
All questions in the textbook that they assign, and the past exams dating however far back. Do them! Push yourself. Study like it‚Äôs the hardest test you‚Äôll ever face, then when u get the exam it‚Äôll be the easiest stuff ever. You‚Äôll question why u studied that hard but in the end you‚Äôll remember it and take it with u to the next year  where they expand on what u learnt this year. 

D: RSG
This is not mandatory. But if u find a real nice rsg group, attend it and stay up to date with them. It‚Äôll help in the long run because u won‚Äôt have smack 4 weeks or 12 weeks of lectures into a day or 2.

E: Use the libraries. 
Go to the library and study. Sit there until u understood ur studying. Studying at home has so many distractions sometimes that u won‚Äôt focus at all. Take some snacks with u and drink lots of water. Pretend ur semesters a marathon because at the end everyone will cheer cuz u completed the damned lengthy race.

That‚Äôs all I did and I‚Äôm bringing my gpa back up now. Hopefully u can understand it, and hopefully this works for u. Everyone works differently but this worked for me so I‚Äôm sharing it.",comment,3

you'll eventually learn to let go of the need for academic validation‚Äî or at least lower your standards lol. i failed two midterms a final and an entire course in my first year. i'm okay now. you'll be fine :)",comment,2

I made a similar post like three years ago! Transitioning from high school to university is a big adjustment, so give yourself time.

Take some time during the winter break, after exams, to reflect on what worked for you and what didn‚Äôt. Use this time to look into courses that genuinely interest you‚Äîit makes a huge difference.

And honestly, it *does* get easier (I know everyone says that, but it‚Äôs true). As you progress, classes will get smaller, and you‚Äôll have more freedom to choose courses you‚Äôre passionate about.

You got this!!",comment,2
