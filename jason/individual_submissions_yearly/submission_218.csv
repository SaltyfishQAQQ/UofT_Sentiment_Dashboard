For all who are reading this post: [***Some points on the current mental health crisis at UofT and the devastating effects of UTSU's decision***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Life-Butterscotch567/comments/1fhpn9r/the_current_mental_health_crisis_at_uoft_and_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

Main post:

Hi,

Does any one have any idea why the mental health coverage has suddenly been reduced to $400 PER YEAR for UTSG full-time undergrads? Is this a joke of some sort? Or do they think UTSG is such a great place for students' mental well-being? Here's the new coverage scheme:

[https://studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan\_UTSU\_Health\_HealthCoverage\_HealthPractitioners\_Psychologists](https://studentcare.ca/rte/en/IHaveAPlan_UTSU_Health_HealthCoverage_HealthPractitioners_Psychologists)

Our health plan used to cover $100 each session for up to 15 times a year. Considering any kind of counsellor or psychologist would go above 150-200 for a single session, 400 dollars per year is just friggin ridiculous. Not everybody can afford to wait half a year to see a psychiatrist in a country with a crumbling healthcare system.

What's odd is that both UTM and UTSC plans as well as the part-time UTSG plan covers 125 per treatment session for 20-25 sessions per year. Why are UTSG full-time undergrads single out for this? Are we penalized for studying full-time here at St. George campus?

No prior notice, no explanation, just leaving us high and dry. Then in the end, I'm probably just supposed to suck it up and suffer. I guess that's the proper UofT experience

Updates:

Sep 13: I just checked at 8AM this morning, now all descriptions of mental health coverage on the Studentcare website have been updated to the new 400 dollar yearly coverage. Part of the changes were made between midnight and 8AM this morning. The UTSU site ~~still shows the old coverage tho~~ (It has also been updated to the new scheme on Sep 16);

The GreenShield Student Centre website doesn't even have our health plan on it. They have UTM, UTSC, and U of T Part-time plans, but not ours. Here's the link: [https://www.greenshield.ca/en-ca/student-centre](https://www.greenshield.ca/en-ca/student-centre);

It seems that The Varsity is now aware of this. Let's see what more they'll find out about this

Sep 15: I have written a little about [***the current mental health crisis at UofT and the devastating effects of UTSU's decision (link)***](https://www.reddit.com/user/Life-Butterscotch567/comments/1fhpn9r/the_current_mental_health_crisis_at_uoft_and_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button). But it's a bit long (I'm really sorry), so I've posted it on my profile.

Statistics for mental health incidents at UofT each year can be found here: [Campus Safety Reports](https://www.campussafety.utoronto.ca/annual-reports)

Sep 16: ***IMPORTANT UPDATE***: UTSU has announced on their [website ](https://www.utsu.ca/mental-health-support-fund/)that they have increased the UTSU Mental Health Care Support Fund to $1,100 per year to compensate for the reduction in insurance coverage. Now, I have not yet been able to access the application form to see the details, but I will let you all know when it becomes accessible.

Evening, Sep 16: The application form is accessible as of now. The instructions seem a bit complex. It seems to read that one has to first use up the health plan coverage and then apply for the fund for up to $100 per visit until the total amount you've applied for during the year exceeds $1,100. And there're also specific requirements for supporting documents. Please correct me if I'm understanding this wrong.

Sep 23: As people have mentioned in the comments and other posts, The Varsity has published an [article](https://thevarsity.ca/2024/09/23/students-raise-concerns-over-utsu-changes-to-mental-health-coverage/) following their investigation. It seems that UTSU still has zero intention of offering any explanation for their action or issuing any sort of apology.

To everybody: It seems that all the inquiries, complaints and increased awareness that all of you have raised up in the last a few days have finally made UTSU at least realize the gravity of their decision. We'll see what future steps they will be taking. Kudos to you all! I'm so proud of everyone here!",submission,126

I also know how triggering suddenly losing access to therapy can feel, so I wanted to share some **free resources** and things we can do:¬†

First, **why not drop the UTSU an email or** [**instagram comment**](https://www.instagram.com/uoftsu/?hl=en)? Or [**send a tip to The Varsity**](https://thevarsity.ca/tips/)?

Second, **there are free counselling services available to support you**. I know how terrifying it can be to suddenly lose access to therapy, especially when that treatment has been life saving, and these resources are here to help you. While these may not replace [your supportive long term theraputic relationship](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272735820301094) (*hey UTSU, click that link for a study you should check out before defending your decision 'because students can just switch to empower me or greenshield plus'*), they may help tide you over if you are no longer able to meet with your therapist or have to cancel sessions in the meantime.¬†

* [**U of T same day & one at a time counselling**](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/same-day-counselling-appointment/). Call Health & Wellness (416-978-8030), choose #5 for mental health, and ask to make a same or next day counselling appointment. They will ask for your college or faculty. Once you have had your first session you can ask to come back for short term sessions. From what I understand, you do not need to do an intake at H&W to access this service.
* [**Telus Health Student Support**](https://mentalhealth.utoronto.ca/services/u-of-t-my-student-support-program-my-ssp/). As a U of T student you have access to the THSS app where you can connect with a counsellor. There is 24/7 support available, though depending on urgency you may be called back the next day. Immediate support is available over the phone in 35 languages and over chat in simplified Chinese, English, French and Spanish.

You may also be able to access **funding to help you keep seeing your therapist.**¬†

* The [**Bursary for Students with Disabilities**](https://registrar.utoronto.ca/finances-and-funding/osap/students-with-disabilities/) (BSWD) is available to **students registered with accessibility services who recieve OSAP**. You can apply for up to $2000/year for counselling, though the process can take a couple months.¬†
   * **Not registered?** You can reach out to set up an appointment to see if you'll be eligible to register and begin the process, you do not need a diagnosis to begin the process, they can help you.¬†
   * **Registered but don't recieve OSAP?** Try making an appointment with your access advisor to see if there is other funding available.
* **Your college may also have need based scholarships/funding** you can apply for to cover your therapy costs, given this sudden change. Reach out to your registrar's office to set up a financial advising appointment.¬†
* In **engineering**? Check out the [**SKULE bursary.**](https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/new-skule-mental-health-bursary-supports-wellness-for-u-of-t-engineering-students/)

Finally, if this change has you **feeling unsafe, distressed, or in crisis** **please reach out for help.** I've listed some distress resources below:

* **Gerstein crisis centre** offers 24/7 support, including respite beds and mobile units [https://gersteincentre.org/](https://gersteincentre.org/)¬†
* **9-8-8 Crisis Helpline:** Call or text 9-8-8¬†
* **Toronto Distress Centres:** 416 408-4357 or 408-HELP",comment,7

To ensure that your healthcare premiums remain among the lowest in the country and to enhance our support for mental health, we have made significant improvements to our coverage.

New Coverage Structure:
- 80% Coverage: We now offer 80% coverage for initial mental health visits, up to $400 per year.
- Additional Support: An extra $1,100 per year (at $100 per visit) is available through our UTSU Mental Health Support Fund.

Continued Maximum Support:
We are maintaining our $1,500 yearly maximum support to ensure comprehensive care while keeping overall costs lower for everyone.

Why This Change?
Our commitment is to make mental health support more accessible and affordable. This new structure reduces out-of-pocket expenses for initial visits and maintains strong support for long-term needs.

We believe these changes will provide greater support and make mental health services more accessible. For more detailed information, please visit our website: https://utsu.ca/mental-health-support-fund",comment,1
