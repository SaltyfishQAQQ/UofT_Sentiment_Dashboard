The supervisor who threatens the student to revoke the admission letter,Ready-Agency-6885,1de36zr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1de36zr/the_supervisor_who_threatens_the_student_to/,1718187454.0,"I'm an international student starting a grad program soon, and my supervisor wants me to start working on thesis papers even before my studies officially begin. He even pressured me to publish a paper six months early. Now, he's pushing me to finish another paper because his grants didn't come through. If I don't comply, he's threatening to change my supervisor or even revoke my admission letter. Can the university retract the admission letter just one month before the program starts? Can they switch my supervisor without my consent?",submission,63

Incredibly inappropriate and possibly illegal - 100% against U of T policies. Do not work with this professor, and PLEASE get in touch with department and school admin.

They cannot revoke your offer, but do bring this up to the program admin and cc the chair. 

Also consider if you want this person as your supervisor. If they're exploiting you already and you're not even their student yet, imagine how bad it will be when you get here.",comment,8

This level of pressure is not acceptable, and it is unlikely to get any better. I would ask for them to help you change supervisor now.",comment,4

They cannot revoke your admission. You do not want to work under this person for the next 4-5 years.

Also curious, what department is this? Pardon my assumption but I suspect you are in the hard sciences",comment,2

If no other prof in the department is willing (or able) to take on OP, even applying elsewhere and losing time (hopefully just a semester) would be better than joining that supervisor. No way that things are going to work out with a supervisor who’s already pulling shady shit before they’re even enrolled.",comment,2

I did grad school at u of t and I’m familiar with the protocols, I was expressing alarm at this story because of what you just said. Yes, expectations are high, but if I or any of my colleagues were ever threatened with having our enrolment revoked because of deadlines our supervisor was experiencing I would have been out of there in a nanosecond, because that is blackmail.",comment,6
