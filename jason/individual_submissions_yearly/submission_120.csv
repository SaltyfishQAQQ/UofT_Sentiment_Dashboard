It's interesting to see there was an in-person press conference that sheds a bit more light on the university's position. I've been trying to find clips of it but only found a few short ones:

Hamas is using SickKids as a shield. They have equipment in there. Should they destroy the entire hospital and all the people inside to target Hamas?

And don’t tell me they gave the opportunity to evacuate. Telling millions of people to evacuate an area within 24 hours, many of whom are physically unable due to illness, disability, being elderly etc, is logistically impossible and is just an attempt to say ‘we warned them so we can kill anyone we see bc if they didn’t leave they have to be Hamas’.",comment,-3

As would if they were in a long term care home, etc, etc. 

Here is what the Red Cross says explicitly:
>That said, a hospital or school may become a legitimate military target if it contributes to specific military operations of the enemy and if its destruction offers a definite military advantage for the attacking side.
>
>If there is any doubt, they cannot be attacked. Hospitals only lose their protection in certain circumstances - for example if a hospital is being used as a base from which to launch an attack, as a weapons depot, or to hide healthy soldiers/fighters. And there are certain conditions too.
>
>Before a party to a conflict can respond to such acts by attacking, it has to give a warning, with a time limit, and the other party has to have ignored that warning.

There are plenty more empathetic individuals than you in the world that have dedicated 40 years of their lives in trying to make the situation better, that don't virtue signal on Reddit and are actually on the ground.

Look up Vivian Silvers. She died when Hamas raided the kibbutz. Shes a Canadian Jewish woman who dedicated 40 years of her life to making Palestinian lives better by actually being there to start programs for Palestians. She was well respected by Israeli and Palestinian communities because of the work she did. Did that stop Hamas from offing her? No.

You have the power to stop the war in Israel and Gaza because you have lots of empathy?

No.

Come back to reality. 

If you were the biggest military in the world and put your foot down saying I'll decimate you both if you don't chill out. You may stand a chance.

If you were the biggest most resourceful trading partner between these two places and said hey I'll stop trade if you both don't chill out. You may stand a chance.
