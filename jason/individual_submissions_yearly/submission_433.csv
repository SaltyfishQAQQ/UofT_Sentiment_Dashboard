I personally don't have any closed friend, once cried about that and tried to make friends, ended up had to accept that I'm an introvert and not meant to become someone I'm not. It may appear to you that people stick together, but the reality is there are a lot of lone wolves who are less noticed and are doing equally well as social people. If you don't get a group of people to stick to without an initiative, just accept what reality is and focus on more important parts of life.",comment,13

Most of us with priorities in mind don't have time to socialize unless it's beneficial to our day I.e it gives a break from the academics but doesn't unplug us from them. If you're going about it with high school mentality, and you want to play and party and have other priorities it will take you longer but you will still find a group that shares those interests.",comment,1

I used to be introverted af back in grade school and uni lifestyle just force me to be open and boom, new friends (people who I got contact on social media) happens left and right.

So, break down into bullet points:

-Get to know people with the same classes as you, even just one

-Be out-going

-Take the short break time of long lectures, or moments after class, to chat

-But if you can manage to not disrupt the class (e.g. the class is big and you talk low), even chatting during class is a good choice. It‚Äôs college now, there won‚Äôt be teachers to tell you be quiet.

And considering you are first year, if you live in dorm, even better, more people to meet there, join the house meetings too. 

That‚Äôs roughly all I did to get to meet new friends, many stayed in contact ever since, hope it could be any help.",comment,1

It‚Äôs a very engaging community. If you aren‚Äôt a commuter and have a college to stay at I suggest you hanging around in the quad and ask people how their classes are going and try talking to them more. It‚Äôs difficult because even I didn‚Äôt know how to make friends given the fact that I talk a lot and am very social (I‚Äôm also a first year). It‚Äôs what going into a new environment does. Take it easy on yourself and try your best like even in classes talk and also ask if you could study tgt in groups. You got this:),comment,1

This isn‚Äôt high school anymore. You have to learn how to fly on your own and be okay with being alone..

If you really want to have real friends you can count on, and to be a good friend to others.

Different schedules? That‚Äôs nothing. Wait until all the other things start interfering with the time you have for your friends. After university, you probably wont see any of them anymore ever lol

It‚Äôs lonely because you haven‚Äôt learned how to be a friend to the one person who will be right there with you every step of the way.

If you just want to know how to find people to hang out with, that‚Äôs easy. Join a team or a club.
