"U of T President's latest message: ""A commitment to free speech""",deleted,1d9tjfm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d9tjfm/u_of_t_presidents_latest_message_a_commitment_to/,1717708973.0,">Dear U of T community,

>Over the past month, many have watched with deep concern as divisions within society related to the war between Israel and Hamas have played out at King’s College Circle on our St. George Campus.

>In our response, we have adhered to the University’s values and principles. Academic freedom for faculty and librarians is foundational to the University.  So too are the right to assemble and protest peacefully and the right to free expression, which includes the freedom to challenge diverging and dissenting views.

>When a small fraction of our community occupies a cherished common space on our campus for more than one month and denies access to those who do not share their views, U of T’s foundational principles are challenged.  Such behaviour is discriminatory and runs counter to our commitment to inclusion and access as well as all the important freedoms we enshrine. 

>Discovery, innovation and progress flourish when diverse perspectives can engage with one another through reasoned, evidence-based debate. The University cannot override its policy and procedures, and adopt a pre-determined conclusion guided by only one viewpoint, as this would be fundamentally at odds with free expression, fundamentals of university governance, and the consultative norms of our academic community.

>Preserving the space within which academic freedom can flourish is also the reason why the University adopted [new guidelines](https://mx.technolutions.net/ss/c/u001.I7QH9QJlytPYeTGKoyJp4yMxUsyGEcZY9f15VsjFhaSSFRaI5YZzScvA4O5k8GA_q75XA_jD93zjL7zFvCtbOyqQfa9BjLgYW2NCX2AptdvlDNFTr1A_6tKZpO2LyTkrUYsx0i50pphN1DZ6ayzPJQ/46z/hy4e-2QMSzaIaWRZTyssYw/h0/h001.4V84bbeMdr67dfa5hgJ4UNr9l9ai_yW7TF_pq5GqjZo) in April 2024 that say we will not choose a side on matters outside our own operations. The encampment organizers are asking us to do just that. Agreeing with the demands as presented by the protestors would create a false sense of unanimity which can discourage or fail to acknowledge opposing views at U of T.

>We believe that a constructive path forward remains available through dialogue. We are in discussion with student representatives of the encampment because we care about all our students and their right to advocate for their beliefs. We have made offers that address their concerns and honour our policies that invite consultation from our community on contentious issues.  At the same time, we are seeking relief through the court to end the unauthorized encampment and to re-open this space so that everyone can have the same right to express themselves without fear or a sense of exclusion. With dozens of incidents now reported to police and five arrests made, it is clear the encampment has become a magnet for activity that is deeply inconsistent with our values, policies and practices.

>From the outset, our goal has been to find a resolution to the unauthorized encampment in a way that avoids the risk of physical confrontation and injury and that enables principled and policy-informed discussions about important issues. We’ve consistently demonstrated patience, restraint, and resolve because we remain convinced that progress is possible in a way that allows us to stay true to our principles. Our community should expect nothing less.

>Sincerely, 

>Meric S. Gertler  
President",submission,227

Excuse me, but if you are refusing calls for divestment or academic boycott you are proving both (a) you are, in fact, picking a side, and (b) these matters are, in fact, within the scope of your operations.

I am also sorry to report, Mr. Gertler, that is impossible not to pick a side:

* “Washing one’s hands of the conflict between the powerful and the powerless means to side with the powerful, not to be neutral.”– Paulo Freire
* “Silence in the face of injustice is complicity with the oppressor.” –Gineta sagan
* “If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.”― Desmond Tutu
* “We must always take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormented.”-Elie Wiesel
* “The hottest place in Hell is reserved for those who remain neutral in times of great moral conflict…\[an individual\] who accepts evil without protesting against it is really cooperating with it.” –Martin Luther King Jr.

Gertler has chosen the side of the oppressor. He is cooperating with evil. He is siding with race-supremacists. He is materially supporting genocide.",comment,23

This encampment goes beyond a simple rally- people are feeling threatened, and being disrespected, why do you want to get behind that? University is for education, not grandstanding. And honestly, Why should a university get behind Any sort of political debate? Would you want the universities to contribute to who gets voted for/against in an election? No, cuz it's not their business, it is up to each individual to choose their beliefs. 

Can you not have some compassion for your fellow humans, or are you all just here for a good fight? Is it fair that Jewish students are threatened at the university where all students are equally invested? And when they have Nothing to do with what's going on on the other side of the world?? 

I believe we need to stop being so attached to our causes and start to look at ourselves instead. What can we do to create peace in the world?

Saying al qassam has barely any capability is inaccurate. They have significant anti tank and IED capabilities, as shown from footages released so far. They also carried out attacks using drone dropped munitions which indicates they’re able to counter IDF’s electronic warfare efforts to some extent. Although IDF has a much greater tech and firepower advantage, the nature of urban warfare can greatly reduce those advantages. Tanks suck at urban warfare, radars can’t see into buildings, and infrared can’t see underground, for example.

However U of T has been a proud supporter of Ukraine and Ukrainians since the start of the war by Putin. The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Putin even though an investigation into his war crimes aren't conclusive either.

For Gaza, there's genocide case against Israel at the ICJ, arrest warrants for Netanyahu from the ICC, and the United Nations put Israel on the blacklist of shame for human rights violations against children.

i understand that there's a lot of hurt and deep pain from the lives lost on oct 7 and the hostages taken, but i just cannot in good conscience say that what israel is doing is justifiable at this point. as a case study, the US did not wantonly bomb saudi arabia after the attacks on 9/11, and they should not have, because that has never been a useful strategy to exterminate or deradicalize terrorists. of course, the historical context is different, but the math is very similar...

1. This is not a WAR. This is a brutal Apartheid Occupier since 1948 that has been stealing land, displacing Palestinians,  confining them in a concentration camp,  refusing their right to return to their homes against International laws,  building illegal settlements against Intl laws - when an Occupier murders innocent OCCUPIED civilians,  it's not a War, it's genocide & ethnic cleansing.  Read S. Africa's application , UN resolutions,  & every NGO if you want resources. 
2. Hamas was 40 after the Deir Yassin,  Tantura massacres in 1948 Nakba.  Hamas was supported by Israel in 2005 elections in Gaza because Israel did not want Fatah to win to split West Bank & Gaza Govt. Israel supported Hamas especially Netanyahu who stated in 2019 that support for Ha.as was necessary to split West Bank & Gaza Govt to avoid discussing 2 state solution.
3. West Bank (NO HAMAS) - settlers & IDF are murdering Palestinians every year - close to 500 dead in 2023 , getting worse every year as more illegal settlements are build on Stolen land. In 2 years, more Palestinian civilians were killed in West Bank than Oct 7th.
4. Hostages; thousands of Palestinian children are in military jails (the only state in the 6 that takes children through military court) vs. Israeli children are taken through Civil Court. 99.7% conviction in Military court , no representation,  most of the children charged w throwing stones,  min sentence 6months to years.
5. West Bank Palestinians go through check points every day, drive on separate roads, have special license plates, cannot walk on roads used by Settlers, basically an Apartheid system - whereas new Settlers (not semites) across the world are paid to immigrate,  have none of the restrictions.

The hatred seems to spread outwards and Jewish schools, daycares, holocaust memorials etc. seem to be fair targets in being harassed and worse (some even shot at). Genocide isn’t the same as laying down arms, you’re right why would Israel stop fighting when Hamas and Arab fighters almost exclusively target Jewish civilian targets in war and incursions? When a nation that’s been calling for the genocide of a group of people crosses their border and murder, rape and kidnap civilians, that’s a declaration of war. Luckily Israel has spent a huge amount of its GDP on their army and essentially runs a citizen soldier country they were prepared. Sucks so much in the region is spent on war instead of improving everyone’s living standards. It’s incredibly irresponsible for the government of Palestine to attack and not be prepared for the ensuing war. War sucks for everyone involved, no one fighting it wants it, but I don’t think anyone thinks the war can end with Hamas still in power. If the Palestinians do not support Hamas, where are they getting soldiers from? Why haven’t they been removed from office at all? Plenty of countries have unpopular governments and leaders toppled. I understand the difficulty to do so before this conflict, but now the structure of Hamas has failed, why are the people not calling for and enforcing change?

Israeli Universities & business use technology & are proud to announce to the World the technology is ""tested"" on Palestinians. A War is between 2 armies, 2 states not between an Occupier and  their Occupied.

You said 2.2 million. Which means Gaza. There are no settlements in Gaza after the 2005 withdrawal. Ergo, when you say they stole their land you must be saying Israel itself is stolen land. But that land is granted by a UN resolution. So either that resolution is invalid and thus the settlement resolutions are invalid, or Israel has a right to exist and the settlement resolutions are valid. You can't pick and choose which are valid or not. 

If you're going to be so cocky and ranting about this topic you might want to learn the difference between the west bank and Gaza. Maybe do a deeper dive on the subject instead of googling on the spot. It's the most basic information to even begin talking about such a complicated topic. Also fyi regarding the caging, Gaza shares a land border with another country besides Israel. Also the Jews can trace 3000 years of ancestry to historical Palestine. The Muslim Arab population are themselves occupiers that came later. They both live there now so it's irrelevant but you keep saying words you don't know the meaning of.

Nobody wants kids getting killed. But you are quite frankly only stirring up hate and doing both sides a disservice to flaunt your supposed moral superiority. If you actually want to do the right thing, then actually put in the work and become educated on the topic. And no I don't mean googling wikipedia on the spot.

Are you incapable of having a civil conversation? Don’t like facts? Saudi Arabia and Israel do not even have normalized relations. The saudis literally pulled oil and caused the 1973 oil crisis to support Palestine lol. Lest we forget all the support sent in all the other conflicts or the Khartoum Resolution. They also still do not recognize the state of Israel. SA has always supported the Arab league, only now are things warming up, not because SA supports Israel, but because they don’t like Iran. SA school system also pushes the anti Israeli narrative in their education. When polled, 96% of Saudi participants believed that Arab nations should cut all ties with Israel, 95% of Saudis did not believe that Hamas killed civilians in its attacks on Israel, 40% of Saudis expressed a favorable opinion of Hamas, and only 16% of Saudis said that ""Hamas should stop calling for the destruction of Israel, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution to the conflict based on the 1967 borders."" Perhaps you’re mixing conjecture and your lack of knowledge on the region for friendly ties? Or it could likely be the lack of understanding between warming ties and existing relationship. SA has a history of supporting Palestine and Hamas that is up and down, but I’m sure you knew that. ;) You can do your own research from here on out, I’m not here to spoon feed you.

There are a number of Jordanian and Arab NGOs intent on providing education to those communities that is not based on radicalizing them. Likewise in Gaza, since Hamas took power, the usual interchange between Palestinians and Israelis stopped, meaning we have a whole generation growing up with no first hand knowledge or personal relationships with those on the ""other side""...this makes it much easier for both sides to demonize each other, and is exactly the dynamic that makes the current tragedy possible.

Hamas are Palestinian people, they’re the same people that were there in 73, and that support built the Hamas party. Hamas isn’t some separate organization, they are the Palestinians peoples government. Remember, if they didn’t have popular political support they wouldn’t be in power anymore, especially as a war rages on. Not sure why you don’t consider support, support. SA allows fundraising on its territory for Hamas and has sent money, that’s pretty clear. SA has suspended talks with Israel about normalization in support of Hamas. Is that support or does that not count for some reason? They assisted them before they moved closer to Iran, forgot about 2011 already? Egypt as well has allowed smuggling for how long from its territory? You’re delusional if you think they haven’t provided support. As for Rafah, Egypt is blocking it to force Palestinians to stay in their territory, not to help Israel. They’ve been helping arm Hamas to keep a buffer alive between them and Israel. How do you think the armaments got to Gaza in the first place? Divine intervention? How does Gaza stay afloat? I mean you can read the news or read about the last decade of history.

Also, with that logic, South Africa and Spain are also Hamas supporters because they took Israel to court for genocide.

I wish I could live in your alternative reality with made up facts and random conjecture. You have no context to the plot. Cool you’ve been able to come to conclusions about other Hamas supporters, not sure what that has to do with it? You seem to be dividing Hamas and Palestinians into two different groups of people to try and make your argument work. They’re the same group. Literally the biggest reason Egypt closed it was to stop the flow of people, have you not seen the walls? Lol. Your figures are also from a pretty bad source, which has been all over the news as of late, but you don’t care do you? You seem upset the side you want to win is losing? I’m not sure what you’re trying to argue at this point, that Hamas magically makes missiles out of thin air? 

Hamas returns hostages, conflict over. Hamas leaves office, conflict over. Palestinian people eject Hamas from office, conflict over. I don’t think anyone actually believes the conflict will end with Hamas in power.

What’s Israel supposed to do when the main goal and constitution of Hamas (the government elected by Palestinian people and enjoys very high levels of support) is to wipe out all Jews and the Palestinian government maintains a Martyr fund? The war is wrong, but how much shelling and insurgencies does Israel have to take to make the war just in your opinion? There’s been what, thousands if not tens of thousands of shells and missiles launched at Israel prior to this? You can see the list on Wikipedia and most sources readily. Either the war is just or unjust for both sides. You don’t get to cherry-pick either side.

Man is a wolf to man. Both sides are just in their wars (though I think the whole wipe out Jews thing is not right), but the Jewish people fought a war to establish their state and won. This justifies the Palestinians to do the same, they have every right to try to establish a state the same with Israel did. That being said, part of being a responsible government is being prepared. Hamas was elected and enjoys popular support. Hamas has wanted war for a long time and has gotten it. Unfortunately as war goes, the sins of the father are metered on the sons. Plenty call for the death of Israel (replace Israel with any conflict) but aren’t too keen when it’s their time to fight.

People rush to “think of the children!” But where was that sentiment when random shellings have been going on, targeted at civilians, for decades. Heck, even during the larger fights (think arab Israeli war, Yom Kippur) the arabs focused on civilian targets, not military. This war is a culmination of decades of history, not just October 7th. Now it seems to be a problem because an actual war has broken out instead of consistent low level skirmishes and attacks. I think that reflects poorly on many people protesting for the war to stop. They didn’t really seem to care until now, which is problematic.

What makes Israel a terrorist state and not Gaza? I’m curious to your reasoning here. You seem to suggest the war is just for one side but not the other? How am I morally depraved? Because you don’t like facts? Why do you keep resorting to name calling?

Edit: I should have checked your history first. Now it makes sense, you believe in alternative facts because your side is losing. As an Arab myself, you’re being embarrassing spreading your lies and hatred. I’m not going to keep spoon feeding you facts and you simply ignore it. You’re spreading hatred and misinformation because you are ok with Jewish people and Israelis being slaughtered. Learn how to actually talk with some respect instead of slinging accusations of racism or being morally depraved. Your train of thought “it’s only wrong when Israel does it” is anti-Semitic and disgusting. I hope your racism doesn’t cross into your profession.",comment,0

Would you be okay with your land being stolen? A simple Google search would show thousands of articles on Palestinians dying in the West Bank with no one being held accountable. We keep talking about releasing Israeli hostages, but is anyone talking about the Palestinian children held hostage in Israeli prisons with no charges? Have you ever stepped back and questioned why Palestine is fighting against Israel? Do you think they’re just anti-Semitic, or do you think they’re fighting for basic human rights and their land back?

You keep saying I’m clueless about this conflict. I’m literally Palestinian. My family was displaced in 1948 with many members killed. I had no citizenship my whole life because Israel kicked my family out, and I was not allowed to have a passport until I got my Canadian citizenship. I have family friends who have lost hundreds of their family members in this Gaza war. I am not clueless about this conflict because it’s not a conflict. It’s a one-sided genocide and apartheid that has affected my whole life.

Now, before you somehow defend Israel one more time, just think about how the ICJ, the highest ruling court in world justice, has ruled Israel probably guilty of genocide, collective punishment, blockade, starvation, and cutting off the water supply to a whole population of people.

Defending Israel? Did you read my last post? I’m arguing with you because you’re clueless. You’re clearly not a great reader. Why do you hate Jews so much? I justify the conflict for Palestinians in my previous post. Miss that while you’re frothing at the mouth? 

Lol talk about moving the goal post eh? Now you want to talk about West Bank? I’m done talking to someone who is morally bankrupt and seemingly racist. Because of the actions in West Bank, you’re saying we should support genociding Jews? Nothing like having to dance around points when you have nothing of value to say and skirt everything. Good work drawing an arbitrary line in time to assign ownership to land.

I know you’re Palestinian (which is why you’re so heavily invested in alternative facts and assigning blame to Jews). Sorry your conjecture doesn’t have much value and you’re vehemently biased.

Just so we’re clear, you’re using your experiences to validate rape, kidnapping and killing? Is that correct? I don’t see you calling for any peace, rather pushing for more attacks from the side that actually calls for genocide (just going to ignore things like martyr fund?). How about the hostages just released from a journalist and doctor?

You’re clueless because you drank the kool aid. You believe anything that supports your point of view and deny anything that doesn’t. Super glad you’re using that logic in your new adoptive country…

As I said, I know your Palestinian I am actually 99% certain I know you from guelph k-w area. I hope your bias doesn’t affect your practice (if you’re who I think you are). 

Maybe re read my post and try and find an actual issue with it. You’re essentially just making shit up in response to me and not addressing anything. Why is it OK for Palestinians to attack Jewish civilians without reprisals? Because you’re Palestinian? Why are their lives worth less? When will Palestine start to spend money on developing themselves instead of tens of thousands of missiles and shells? When does the ownership of the situation fall on Palestinian hands? Is the war just or unjust to you - it is either or not both. You really seem to say it’s OK for Palestinians to kill Israelis because they’re Israelis and you’ve decided to award the land to Palestinians because you’ve arbitrarily selected a time to do so. With that logic, do Jews have claim to the land? If not, why? When will Hamas do something to benefit the people who voted them in and the people who support them? Where is all the money coming from for Palestinians to attack so often for so long? If Palestinians want an end to war then they must shed Hamas, everyone is aware of it. Hamas just announced no peace that calls for them to lay down weapons. So just have Israel stop so they can attack some more? Get real and start thinking real politik. Hamas is, but if Israel does you throw a shit fit? What does that make you? I’ll let you figure that one out. ;) 

So, give a solution then. Israel has tried the two state thing 5 times, and the Palestinians have attacked, killed and raped in response everytime (almost exclusively targeting civilians). What do you suggest?",comment,0

You have to be trolling. I do not believe you are a serious person. I literally brought up the West Bank because you somehow came up with the conculusion that Hamas giving up the hostages and resigning their posts with the war ending. I BROUGHT THEM UP to show you how that is not true. THERE IS NO HAMAS IN THE WEST BANK and Israel continues to commit war crimes with the whole world watching. 

>  Because of the actions in West Bank, you’re saying we should support genociding Jews?

Nope I am saying Israel keeps committing war crimes in the West Bank even though there is no Hamas there. So why are you saying No Hamas = No war??? Talk about not being a great reader LOL


 > Just so we’re clear, you’re using your experiences to validate rape, kidnapping and killing?

Nope, I am saying rape, kidnapping and killing is bad. Israelies and the IDF need to be held accountable

Please watch the documentary ""Tantura"" and see how Israel's inception started with raping and killing innocent Palestinian girls. 

Lets also not forget all the UN reports that came out this war documenting the rapes and killing done by IDF soldiers on Palestinian girls

>  I am actually 99% certain I know you from guelph k-w area

LMAO, talk about conjecture. You are a carbon copy of every Hasbara machine, just pure projection and 0 self awareness

fyi i dont even know what the k-w area is

>  I hope your bias doesn’t affect your practice (if you’re who I think you are)

???

> Why is it OK for Palestinians to attack Jewish civilians without reprisals? 

No one said it's OK. Harming civilians is a line no one should cross. Unfortunately, one side has been harming, killing, and raping civilians in a way bigger scale. One side is an open air prison, the other is a military superpower

> Why are their lives worth less?

Are you being facetious? It's literally a 30 to 1 ratio of Palestinian civilian deaths to Israeli.

> When will Palestine start to spend money on developing themselves instead of tens of thousands of missiles and shells?

Israel has literally bombed every hospital and university in Gaza. Are you that mentally depraved or just a racist that you can't think Gazans want a better lives for themselves but Israel keeps bombing the living shit out of them.

> you’ve decided to award the land to Palestinians because you’ve arbitrarily selected a time to do so. With that logic, do Jews have claim to the land?

What are you even on about? I am not awarding the Palestinians their land, they are indigenous to it. Palestinians have been living in their lands for centuries and the sad truth is a random criminal from Brooklyn with 0 claim to the land that wants to flee the US can come and steal your house. That's how Israel works. Please take a minute and watch the video:

> If Palestinians want an end to war then they must shed Hamas, everyone is aware of it.

Please see above

> Hamas just announced no peace that calls for them to lay down weapons.

Classic false news spreading propaganda machine. Hamas has been negotiating a permanent cease fire for months. Its Israel that is not accpeting the terms, which includes freeing the palestinian hostages from Israeli prisons

>  Israel has tried the two state thing 5 times, and the Palestinians have attacked, killed and raped in response everytime (almost exclusively targeting civilians)

Spreading false news once again. Its Israel that rejects the two state solution

Every year, they vote against a 2SS that over 95% of the world agrees to. Every year for 35 years at the UNGA.

From another comment:

""Lets pick 2008 because that’s one of the years Israel love to show that they made a 2SS offer (but this happens every single year since 1989): https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/643898?ln=en

Whole world gets together. 164 states says yes to ending the occupation and having 2 states and ending this damn matter. 7 say no. And look at the No’s “NAURU” “PALAU” “MICRONESIA.
