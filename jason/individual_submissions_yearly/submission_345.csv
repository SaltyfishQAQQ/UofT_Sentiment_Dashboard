The reality is that addicts are going to use drugs, and offering sites where addicts can inject in a controlled environment reduces overdoses and deaths. And I'm sorry, but this shows how uninformed you really are on the issue. Safe consumption sites do not offer drugs to users. They only serve as a safe place to inject, and have people there with narcan or other support if someone overdoses. No one is ""giving drugs"" to users at these sites ([source](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/substance-use/supervised-consumption-sites/explained.html)). As for source, I'm referring to[ this](https://www.ccsa.ca/sites/default/files/2020-06/CCSA-Expanded-Response-Options-Opioid-Harms-Case-Studies-2020-en.pdf) publication by the Canadian Centre on Substance Use and Addiction from 2020. There's also [this](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34218964/) article discussing the effectiveness of safe injection sites in improving patient outcomes. There's [this](https://harmreductionjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12954-017-0154-1#Sec10) article which discusses the outcome of safe injection sites in Vancouver, and recommends an expansion of such services. Then there's [this](https://odprn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Estimating-the-Effects-of-Closing-Supervised-Consumption-Sites-in-Toronto.pdf) article which discusses the impacts these closures will have on the accessibility to these supervised consumption sites for Toronto citizens who use it. So if you want to say that you feel personally they don't work, fine. That's your opinion. But don't say that the research supports your position when it unequivocally does not.",comment,10
