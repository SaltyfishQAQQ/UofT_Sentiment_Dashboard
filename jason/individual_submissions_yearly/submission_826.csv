It also comes with networking opportunities, a community of scholars, professional guidance, etc etc. However, before winning this, I was committed to EngSci at UofT with a completely unknown $80,000 scholarship. Is UofT EngSci worth passing up the title of Schulich Leader? I already posted smth similar on the UAlberta page but wanted diverse opinions. How does UofA Eng compare to UofT EngSci? 

For reference - I like the 2+2 engsci structure, I want to go to grad school, I like PEY better than the UofA co-op structure, and I currently live in BC.

I can speak to some of the culture and experiences of both universities as well as some of the logistical issues. 

  
UofA:

The UofA offer is a very good offer and the Engineering Faculty is easily one of the best in Western Canada. However, it is very focused on the Oil and Gas industry and you will see that in your classes. If you're okay with that, then great. UofA is currently going through something of a budgetary crisis due to inept leadership from the UCP. This likely won't hurt you specifically, but you may suffer some trickle-down effects in terms of faculty makeup (taught by PhD students or adjuct profs rather than true professors). The business connections you will make through scholarship will be oil and gas related. 

Edmonton is a very cold city, though it has been warmer recently. Lows of -25C are normal in the winter and extreme cold snaps up to -45C (with windchill) are a yearly event. The city is certainly much more sedate than Toronto and there are more homeless folk per capita in Edmonton than in Toronto. They are also more aggressive in their panhandling. Overall, Edmonton is slightly less ""safe"" than Toronto but substantially more safe than basically any city in the US. Food in Alberta is generally more costly than in Toronto - especially fresh goods. The food scene in Edmonton is hot and there are really great restaurants in Strathcona (East of Campus) and Downtown (North of Campus). The vibe of the city is somewhere between country town and hipster city. 

If you're staying in residence, you are about a 10 minute walk from the residence buildings to your faculties buildings. Much of that walk can be cut through various buildings and tunnels to avoid the cold. The residences are... fine if slightly dated. If you can afford a one-person suite then it's worth it. Housing outside of campus is fairly prevelent and reasonably priced-ish. The downtown core is directly connected to the UofA via transit and it will take you about 15 min to transit from the downtown to the core of campus. This gives you lots of housing options which will matter a great deal after your first year. 

  
UofT:

The UofT offer is also very good but the city is much more expensive to live in overall. The 80K wont go as far in Toronto as it would in another city. The lack of the connections through the scholarship won't matter as much because the major corporations are immediately nearby. If you invest in some networking experiences you will get basically the same effect (though not facilitated). 

Toronto is... well... Toronto. It is huge and if you don't like the vibe of where you are just walking 10 blocks in any direction will change that vibe. Transit in Toronto is far superior than to Edmonton. The amenities in terms of parks, beaches, activities, and food are all going to be vastly superior to a city 1/6th of it's size. All of that comes with different problems. Housing is very expensive here, like UNBELIEVABLY expensive. Food is no longer cheap. Homelessness is more present because the weather is milder - but is actually smaller per capita than Edmonton. The weather is nicer than Vancouver but nothing like anything in the West has really. Think of it like a slightly warmer and more humid Vancouver in the Summer and a slightly cooler and more snowy Victoria in the winter. I generally find the climate here to be lovely - others complain more. 

  
The UofT is a great school and carries a great brand along with it. That said, with engineering it's a bit of a wash. UofA and UofTs engineering faculties are basically even in terms of capacity, prestige, business connections, ect. UofT has more variety in terms of what is going on though, much less focus on oil and gas sectors. The UofT campus is not sequestered, and so you have cars driving though it all the time, which is annoying. The collegate system is weird and hard to navigate if you're not familiar with it, but it does bring some distinct advantages such as more tailored assistance/tutoring/ect. 

The eng-phys programs of each are equivalent. All the eng-phys programs basically steal each other's ideas for structure and are constantly watching what other departments are doing.",comment,24

Seymour, the benefactor, explicitly stated when creating the scholarship that it should facilitate learning, not limit it, and as such to qualify for the, in your case, 30k each year, you simply must not drop out or do something so terrible that it appears in the news. You could bomb all of your classes during one semester (not advisable lol), and although it might raise some eyebrows, as long as you have an understandable reason for doing such, illness etc., you’ll retain the scholarship. Similarly, an arguably dogshit GPA (All C-, 2.0 CGPA etc.) won’t cause a loss of your funding. Check your offer email for any recent stipulations of course, although they have historically been extremely lenient.

The network is also quite useful, mostly for the job opportunities. They are extremely willing to put in a word to their many connections upon your request, and I have seen this often result in at least interviews, if not jobs at “prestigious” companies. I also wouldn’t worry about Co-ops at UofA. If you’re competent enough to get two major scholarships you’d have no problem finding a job elsewhere or remotely on your own and the networking opportunities through the Schulich Scholarship may help.

Imo no amount of UofT clout can make up for the lack of financial burden and fast-lane networking possibility that the Schulich Scholarship provides. It might not look as pretty on the resume in later years, but for your undergrad it is unbelievably useful. There are many recent SL’s who have gone on to attend reputable grad schools. UofA also seems to have cheaper living expenses. Congrats on both and good luck with your decision!

It factors in a person who is highly capable and not just academically gifted. The only thing better than that scholarship is the same scholarship at uoft :). The 120 k is great. You don’t need a ridiculous GPA to keep it either. Keep in mind even getting a 2.0 GPA in UofT Eng is not easy and instead is only a bit below average.  If the 80k scholarship requires a 3.0 that will be very hard to maintain at uoft.It allows you to do extra things beyond just focus on academics which is what Schulich had in mind.  

Definitely and without doubt take the Schulich and toss uoft to the curb.",comment,3

Then I’d definitely go to UofT. You can finance almost all of undergrad with 90k (not quite a full ride, but if you consider your pay from PEY, it will be a full ride plus some). 

The way I do this is just usually you have a flat rate of 16k per year tuition, then around the same for the years rent (may differ but it’ll definitely get you through 3 years, after that, PEY salary adds in too!). 

Since you want to go to grad school, I highly suggest UofT due to their available undergrad research positions, experiences and opportunities. Even industry based, I believe UofT is much stronger and prevalent than UofA.

With that being said, I am unfamiliar with the benefits other than money from the SL award. You should try to find other individuals who are SLs and ask them how much the other benefits played a role and gauge it’s value accordingly.",comment,2

The connections you’ll make at U of A will mostly be local, and in the oil industry. But U of T is special because it has international connections, and there are a wide variety of career options in Toronto/Ontario if you want to stay there. 

Living in Toronto is expensive, but you’ll have many more scholarship opportunities at UofT when you get there. Many opportunities to work as an RA and TA as well. I don’t think you should make this decision based on the money alone, that would be shortsighted.",comment,2

I think Edmonton would be a depression-inducing change of scenery coming from there. But regarding tenant rights, OP may not have had to deal with that in BC yet if they still live at home. It’s always better to have more rights. It’s a challenge to find affordable housing in TO but it can be done and is worth it imo. 

Not familiar with those specific neighbourhoods, I was thinking of the downtown core as near City Centre, Churchill Square, Ice District, etc. Those areas, and the LRT, are honestly scary places to be now (and I’m not sheltered, I walk around at night in Toronto by myself). There are roving gangs of homeless who prey on vulnerable people using elaborate scams. The store stalls in city centre are mostly vacant now as businesses have closed their locations in the mall. It’s eerily empty and taken over by threatening people. 

Last summer when I visited, I considered going to the taste of Edmonton food festival. Then saw on the news that a father who was there with his family was randomly stabbed. 

Honestly the vibes in Edmonton last summer were terrible. If I had to live there now I’d stay very close to the UofA area or just across the river near the legislature.",comment,2

There are plenty of UofT engineering undergrads I know of who didnt get these scholarships, did well, and are now doing grad school in top universities in the states and in the UK. Obviously the same can be said about people who chose this scholarship however it’s ultimately up to you in deciding what you value more? Also where do you see yourself working and doing internships? Toronto or Alberta? Are there any profs at either university doing research that particularly interests you? Ultimately the deciding factors for grad schools are going to be your gpa, letter of intent, references and prior research experience.",comment,3
