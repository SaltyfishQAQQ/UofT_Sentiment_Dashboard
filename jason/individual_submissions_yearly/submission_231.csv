How do you guys learn from the flipped classroom model?,EmergencyAcorn,1fw36mz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fw36mz/how_do_you_guys_learn_from_the_flipped_classroom/,1728058879.0,"(Possibly) unpopular opinion: it doesn't work for me. I don't see the point.

I see many math classes do this, where you read the textbook ahead of time, and the prof guides the class to do a couple questions and disscuss the answers in class.

My question is, if I've already learned the materials at home, what is the point of showing up to class? I find the in class exercises extrememly easy and I don't seem to learn much from it, because all the materials were learned from me reading the textbook at home. By myself, without a lecturer. It might as well be an asynchronous class with a large tutorial section.

Although I can learn the material on my own, I much, much prefer having a lecturer guide me through the lesson, simply because English isn't my first language and I find it tedious to read a large chunk of English text.

Yes, I understand that self-learning is an important skill. But why does the university bother giving us a prof, a classroom, a dedicated timeslot in the day, if we're expected to do 90% of the learning on our own?",submission,118

That, or just don't study ahead of time and show up to listen. At this point you're ostensibly an adult, and you should be able to make your own decisions when it comes to how you use your time, and what you find useful.

The point of teacher is to present material in a much more understandable manner than what a textbook does. I like going to lectures to understand 75% of the topic at least and fill gaps through the textbooks, extra readings and going through notes again. Occasionally for profs that are fast or subjects that are dense I would spend 10 minutes having a glance at slides posted in advance. If I do this then I often have no work after the class is done and can jump into problems/assignments. 

If I read the book for the same topic itâ€™s going to take me longer than the 1.5 hours itâ€™ll take the prof to explain. So whatâ€™s the point? Feels like laziness tbh.",comment,8

If the asynchronous component of a flipped classroom is just 'read chapters x and y and do some practice problems', it will not work.

It has been shown repeatedly that the asynchronous component of the flipped classroom is almost entirely responsible for learning gains while the in-class discussion component does next to nothing for student outcomes. So, strong implementations require an enormous amount of up-front effort from the instructor to produce high-quality tailored course content.

I'm not trying to say that flipped classroom never works, but if the instructor doesn't know what they're doing and doesn't put forth the required effort to make it successful (which sadly most don't), then the students are better off with a traditional lecture style classroom.",comment,12

Active learning can take many forms, properly structured and thought out flipped classroom technique is just one of them.
Â 
Well structured and thought out lecture can be engaging and beneficial, especially if it curates material and helps with organization.
Reading material before class is great for making yourself familiar with it. The biggest problem in some STEM courses is that one often doesn't know what they don't understand until they have to solve problems and reviewing read material with easy questions would feel unhelpful (even if it helps with retention) and brings the question whether it is the best use of class time.",comment,6
