[Fanfic] [UofT x Reader] Consequences for Procrastination,MAT301_Enjoyer,1ghbl5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ghbl5b/fanfic_uoft_x_reader_consequences_for/,1730483830.0,"I'm the OP of [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g99yaz/any_uoft_x_reader_fanfic_i_hate_my_course_load_so/), I decided before the midterm to write a fanfic myself if I did better than my expectation on the midterm.

Warning: I'm not in any English program, and I even lack this kind of Breadth Requirement, so there might be grammar mistakes or typos. I even googled words like ""bored noun"" to write this fic. This fic might have some out of character. I thought to let c/c (course/code) as the course you are panicing about, but then I think to specify it to a MAT course as from my exprence on my previous post.

**Warning: Some mention of SM(Studying Math) inside.**

Syntax note: y/n is in (your/name) as there are something like (course/code), the (course/code) is represneted as MAT???, as I think revealing this to be a MAT course could improve the immersion.

——————————————

It's 11pm, a day before your midterm of MAT???, your laptop open, displaying the Quercus page of course note and textbook PDF.

Your eyes glued to the screen of the course content, but your brain isn't functioning. The image on your brain is a white sheet with random black marks on it. You stared at the screen but the only thing you noticed was the bright spaces comparing to the light grey on the other spot.

You were panicking, you had planned to look over all the contents on the weekends, but then you procrastianted the weekend over, doing nothing on this course.

The boredom of staring at the course content PDF made you shifted your attention to somewhere else.

How long have you stared at Quercus? Few minutes? How long does it take you to encourage yourself to open the Quercus page?

You grabbed your best buddy, your phone, then you google random stuff to place your restless attention.

No matter how lame the information your phone gives you, it's always more fascinating than MAT???.

You started a new tab on your laptop, getting in to Reddit and searched random stuff in r/UofT. Some years old posts caught your mind and you began reading the post.

There's a dense object of guilt stuck in your stomack, you switched back to Quercus. But you are doing nothing other than skimming through.

With this such guilt inside, you returned to Reddit posts again.

This time you found a fun post, this post is about an urban legend of schools, which sounds like is created to intimidate the students. The contend of this urban legend is, in summary, a student who doesn't study, meets the incarnation of the university itself, and the next day they came to the school with a frightened face. Their friends asked what happened to them, but once that student reminisce the intercourse with the school yesterday, they turned out to be in a great fear and the broken words came out of their mouth is not understandable.

You scrolled the 200+ comments under that post, giggling at the creativity of the OP and the commentors. Lol most people interpret it, as you get punished by the school in person, not on zoom, if you don't study.

You looked at the time, It's about 12am. You opened your course contents but you were attracted by random posts and wasted your time. You know the reason, you are panicking, so you chose procrastination to distract you from the huge anxiety.

With such anxiety pounding in your chest, you searched school x student meme, you found some. ""the real sm is school and me"", and you asked in some group chat , and you get such funny reply "">!I don't need to have sex cuz I'm f\*\*ked up by this school everyday!<"". You can't help the appearence of a grin on your face.

Your shouder is tapped by someone. You freezed. You don't have roomates or anyone that will intrude your room at this time. You can ever hear your heart beat.

You turned your head slowly, and saw a familiar face of a stranger. Not to call it familiar or stranger, you've never met this people before, but the aura of this person is very familiar.

An ominous feeling arised in your mind, please that's just some urban legend made up by some aribitary stressed student. Or you ARE hoping that's the urban legend coming true instad of some robber or stranger intruding your room.

And that person speaks, ""so, that's your study plan for MAT??? ? By searching memes and fics of me. Oh, and also shipping me with UWaterloo, huh?""

You are definitely blushing bc of the reveal of your ""study method"" embarasses you.

""I, ..."" You wanted to defend yourself but no words came out of your mouth.  
You know it, the prof of MAT??? is nice, but you are nervous to reach for office hours. You started reading the textbook in the begining of this term, but you still cannot understand the very first definitions, and that caused confusion for you the whole course.

""You were such a little good student before. Remember last winter, you begged me to fill up your tight little time with more assignments, of your favorite course, c/c.""

Yes, c/c was your favorite course, but the assignments came out late. When the long-awaiting last assignment went out, you have 5 different assignments due on each day of the same week, that really stressed you out. Even after this course is finished, you still thinks and writes about the content of c/c when your are spare, or you are inclass but you cannot concetrate.

The incarnation of the university cupped your chin, and turned your face to the screen. ""Now behave like a good obedient student and study for your midterm.""

You are bounded by the firm strength. Bondaged to a subspace of the 3 dimentiomal Euclidean space.

Still you cannot focus on the course content, the page to you is still made by messgy random symbols.

""You know what will happen to you if you don't study for your midterm.""The anthropomriphism of the university warned.

You know it, you can see the future that how your precious GPA is going to be brutalized.

""Or do you want me to teach you a lesson?""

""Ugh... yes, please?"" You muttered.

The anthropomorphism of your school leans forward, ""That's 600 bucks for you."", and reaches about to touch your sensitive Acorn balance.

You uttered a yelp to stop before your Acorn balance is touched, ""No thanks, I will study for my midterm.""

""You have class at 9am, I won't force you to study all night. But remember, you know what will happen to misbehaving student who doesn't study for their midterm."" The personification of the university left.

This is the day of your MAT??? midterm. There's few hours left from the exam.

You are in one of the study spaces in the building. You cannot clamdown as the time is ticking. The closer to the exam time, the harder you can tranquilize yourself.

You cannot unsee the great buildings as buildings themselves other than part of the person you've met yesterday. Building you are in**⊆**UofT. Comparing the altitude of the building and yourself as a tiny human,.

The last hour before the midterm starts, you started scrolling the pages and tried to memorize the theorems. And you opened reddit and refreshes the page as insane just to calm yourself down.

You silently recited the pieces of the theorems that you can remember, and walked in the exam room.

Your marks were out.

Let α,β,γ,δ∈ℕ, α=c/a=class/average, β=what's going to be curved to an A, γ=your/mark δ=class/highest

You had a look at the marks, α<β<γ<δ. Your mark is definitely considered an A.

——————————————

Author's note: Yes I've expected not understanding each question and get 0 marks on each question for my midterm.

Heck I was still in the anxiety state hours after the midterm, then I did all the draft in my mind, and now the anxiety disappeared I feel rusty to write it.

Thanks to someone to invite me to the fanfic club!

p.s. I hate editor on the phone, I saved the draft then changed the title on my phone and saved the draft again, and everything in the post body is messed up.

The memes are real,  **but there's no such urban legend post, I faked it up to push the plot as one of the setting in this fic**, please don't take this fake urban legend seriously. If you do, please interpret this fake urban legend as >!student who doesn't study gets a spanking from the incarnation of the school!<

Also, could anyone do a word count for this?

And, heck, I checked the syllubus and found that I actually have 4 project/reports.

And note: just have more assignments due on consequent days right after reading week.

I procrastnated for writting this a lot, but I finally finished it today, on my birthday!",submission,97
