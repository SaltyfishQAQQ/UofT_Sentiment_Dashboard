If you can get around to it, maybe go down to MLC if you can get around to it.",comment,4

For example, question 1 was just very similar to #4 from the Unit 2 practice problems and the Limit Computation module. Question 4 was just a modified version of the problem set and tutorial graphing questions. Question 6 was similar to the Fibonacci problem on the practice test, and the one from the problem set. The questions about definitions were basically covered in #5 from Unit 2 practice problems, and the questions about sets, interval notation, and basic proofs were similar to the problems from Unit 1.¬†

So, for the next test, I think just doing the practice problems and making sure you understand the tutorial worksheets and problem sets is enough to be successful.¬†",comment,2
