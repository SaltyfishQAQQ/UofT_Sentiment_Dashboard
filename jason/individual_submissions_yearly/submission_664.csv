Changing preferred name without parents noticing?,lionlionlionlion_,1d9ygdq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d9ygdq/changing_preferred_name_without_parents_noticing/,1717722548.0,"Being an incoming trans student to the university, I've been wondering if changing your name has a chance to alert your parents in any way.

I'm not too worried about my chances being called by my preferred name in individual classes without it, but it would be nice to avoid seeing my legal name in emails. It's not worth it if it means that I can't avoid outing myself to my parents, though. 

It would be nice to know if any externally visible documents or potential communications sent to parents would display this preferred name, and if there's any way to get around that if so. 

Thanks!",submission,30

Edit to add:

My legal name is the one that appears on my academic history/transcript, and as the other commenter said, emails don't get sent to your parents, so you should mostly be good. 

If you're in residence, and your parents help you move in, be mindful of the fact that they may put your preferred name on a sign on your door, where your parents can see it. I believe there's a separate place to specify your preferred name for residences, though, so you could change your display name without changing it for the residence, or just explain the situation to your don later so you can get a new sign or something.",comment,57

I would recommend changing your display first name here: [link](https://my.auth.utoronto.ca/) and changing your UTORid password if you shared that with your parents. If you email help.desk@utoronto.ca (or ideally call 416-978-4357) we can send you an email confirming that you aren't allowed to share your password with anyone.
