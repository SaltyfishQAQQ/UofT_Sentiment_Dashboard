I find it helps me to write ""lecture scripts"" while looking at the slides for a lecture as little as I can- explaining is how I learn best. I start studying for exams depending on the number of lectures on the exam. So, for example, if an exam includes 7 lectures of content, I will start studying 7 days before the exam (at least), going over a lecture a day.

Start assignments as early as you can. I plan out ""chunks"" that I'll finish day by day to get to the deadline, which helps break down a big assignment into something more manageable. I even account for just sitting down, reading the assignment, and understanding it/planning out how I want to go forward. So for example, if I have a lab report, I'll have a goal of finishing the introduction maybe 2 weeks before the deadline, then the results, etc. 

Get feedback whenever you can. If a TA or a prof offers to proofread your work before you hand it in, DO IT. 

Attend all your lectures- barring illness (mental or physical- sometimes you need a day for your mental health), more important commitments (family events, work-related things, etc). I go to every lecture that I reasonably can. It keeps me on track and that way I don't have to spend time just catching up when I could be studying/doing assignments. 

Take care of your mental and physical health. Get enough sleep. Get some exercise every now and then. Eat regularly and try to eat healthy when you can (even 1 healthy snack or meal is better than none everyday). University is infinitely harder when you're not taking care of yourself.",comment,115

1. Priotize based on assigment weighting - don't study the same amount for a test worth 20% and a quiz worth 5% 

2. Don't leave any free marks on the table - Participation/Take-home quizzes/soft assignments need to be as close to 100% as you can, profs include them so they can make the real stuff (midterm/exam) as hard as they desire. Attend all lectures, even if you are too tired/done with life to take notes, just being there will allow you to absorb things that might not be in lecture slides.

3. Reading through the syllabus carefully! This will typically give you a good idea of what the course is actually trying to achieve and will help you plan/study for final exam. 

4. Create a schedule in 1st week of classes to identify where your light/busy periods will be - be proactive with completing assignments where possible. Chances are if you feel you have no work to be doing, you are wrong lol. 

5. Use your Profs/TA's - going to office hours/asking questions has been extremely helpful in my experience. 

6. The name of the game is CONSISTENCY. Studying for 1-2 hours a day vs. fitting all studying into 2-3 day window a week will pay dividends, your brain can only absorb so much information at once. 

Hope this helps, good luck this fall!",comment,63

As a former TA and current educator I would add these:

Go to all the lectures you reasonably can — *especially* the last ones. I find students tend to blow these off because they don’t think “real” material is covered and they figure the time is better spent studying. FALSE! The prof will often give important info about the exam, go through practice questions that will be on there, or even drop obvious clues about what to focus on and what not to. We also notice who sticks it out until that last class, which — like it or not — matters. 

Similarly, going to office hours and being personable, coming with questions, etc can really pay off. Putting a face to a name when grading can earn you a couple “grace” points. Teachers are human beings too. You have no idea how many negative interactions TAs and profs have with students — arguing over marks, complaining, asking for grade changes, dealing with AO shit. Simply being nice and curious and present can sometimes round a 79.4 up to an 80. But you didn’t hear that from me…",comment,9

Take the syllabus, find the section with the breakdown of due dates and test dates. Write those down on a big visual calendar. Colour code those dates and assignments per course. Do this for all courses and all assignments, even homework. 

Next, do the same thing except in chronological checklist fashion. Earliest assignment at the top. Then one by one. 

What this does is give your brain an overview of the flow of your semester. When will you have three assignments due in two days? What exams are bunched together? Do you have a quiz on the same day as an essay? And so on. The checklist gives you a logical sequence of events and while you dont have to do the assignments chronologically, you can check things off and gamify your studying. 

It also helps prevent you from developing that “meh, I have time” mentality which can be fatal when it comes to falling behind. And it becomes less daunting to not know what is coming up or how much you will need to know.",comment,19

1. Sacrifice going out with friends, sometimes. Obviously try to plan ahead so you can do both, but if you have an examination or essay and your friend says “hey let’s go out for drinks, we’re all going out,” you need to have the courage to say: “sorry guys I have to stay home and study.”

2. Discuss expectations with your TA and Profs before the first assignment, after every assignment, and before the final(s).

3. Sit in the front row and participate if possible. Yes you will look like a keener, but tbh as long as you’re not asking stupid/irrelevant questions, no one will care. Participating helps you remember as opposed to sitting there mindlessly taking notes and checking instagram or chatting with a friend, etc.

4. Learn how to study for different classes. If you have a course that is essay-based, you do not need to take extensive notes because there is no exam. Conversely, if your course is only examinations, then take thorough notes. If your course requires participation, pick out the RQ, thesis, hypotheses, methodologies, main findings, and implications of your assigned reading (if applicable).

5. Relatedly, do the fucking readings. This isn’t necessary for all courses since some profs will just regurgitate the readings, but you should be doing the readings one way or another.

6. Realize that after doing all of this, you’ll still fail at one point because life sucks and you just have to take it on the chin and carry yourself the same way you would if you had gotten a 4.0.",comment,7

I struggled to find motivation to study for the first two years and it feels more like a chore more than anything. I realized two things that made me average a 3.7 (up from a 2.3) in my final two years of study:

1. Confidence is key. I personally did not enjoy studying because I did not feel like I was competent or capable enough compared to my peers. A friend of mine told me that they see me as a smart person who has not found his groove yet, and that motivated me to study hard just to prove them right. You are studying in one of the most prestigious universities in the world. We all have a love-hate relationship with UofT but we can't deny that a lot of people would want to be in our shoes right now. OP,  I do not know you personally but I would like to let you know that you are a brilliant person. Have confidence in yourself and try and be as involved with school as possible. Attend seminars regarding topics you are interested in or speak to TAs and profs personally. FORCE yourself to be involved and soon enough, you will find your own groove.

  
2. Spread out your work. Usually people start the semester working hard and then they just get burnt out mid-semester. To prevent burn out, I created internal deadlines for assignments and readings 3-5 days before they are due. SPREAD IT OUT as much as possible. As soon as you discover how much easier this makes your life, you will want to keep the momentum going. You will find that you are less burnt out, have more time for your hobbies, and you will enjoy the things you are studying.

FWIW I got straight As and attribute that far more to my studying habits than to my intelligence. 

* **I took notes as questions-and-answers.** I would go through the lecture notes and rewrite each point as a question-answer in a Word document. So if the lecture notes said: ""The mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell"". I would write in my Word doc: ""What is the powerhouse of the cell? Mitochondria."" Then I'd copy and paste all of the questions (without answers) to a separate document. When it came time to study for tests, I would use that ""questions only"" document to test myself. Usually, the first time through, I'd get 70% of the questions wrong. I'd highlight these in red and copy the red questions to a separate document. Then I'd try these red questions again. I'd keep going until I had no wrong answers. This usually took 3-4 tries. Then, I'd redo the whole ""questions-only"" document again.
* **Started studying for tests 3 weeks out.** First week was for my Q+A content review document. Next 1.5 weeks were for practice tests and problem sets. Last few days were for anything I felt needed extra attention + redoing one practice test and acing it for confidence. With the practice tests and problem sets, I'd use the same approach as with the Q+As: keep doing them until you can solve every question (without looking at the answers).
* **Scheduled my test studying**. My above point sounds great if you have one course and no other responsibilities. In reality, you'll have tons of different priorities during midterm and exam season. I'd schedule my studying plan to make sure I could get through all of the content I wanted to get through. I'd usually make the schedule about a month out from a midterms/exams.
* **I didn't go to lecture unless I absolutely had to**. This one might be controversial and may not work for everyone, but I could just never focus in class. I realized I was just wasting that hour + the time commuting to and from class. I only went to lectures if there was no other way to get the lecture notes (or if there were attendance requirements). I also rarely went to office hours or tutorials.
* **I didn't study with friends** - Again, your mileage may vary on this and studying with friends can be fun, but I just feel like it is inefficient. You need to be sure going into a test that you can answer questions by yourself, not with your friends around. Plus, it's easy to get distracted/sidetracked with your friends. 
* **I worked 40-50 hours per week** - Ultimately, if you want good grades and you're not a genius, you have to put in the hours. I treated school like a full-time job (which is definitely a privilege to be able to do; I didn't have to get a part-time job for financial reasons). I worked 40-50 hours a week (including class time). This was probably overkill, but it's what I did.

Also, FWIW, this is just advice on how to maximize your grades. This kind of approach can get lonely if you don't have friends outside of classes or you don't have extracurriculars.  You may have other objectives and they may be just as if not more valuable than getting straight As.",comment,3

Visit your professors and TAs whenever possible. They are your best resource. But good luck and plan ahead because they are all crazy busy.  And they are the ones marking you. If they remember you as a diligent hardworking student you will benefit in many ways. Don't be a pest.

I usually slept no more than 7 hours nightly. If not researching, then studying, if not that then research. The stacks have everything (original work betters all other)...and with those libraries and online information...

Make sure you stay healthy as the hours will wear on you. Eat right, low fat, high proteins, low carbs or whatever your own body handles well. Try for 2 good meals daily. And find time for yourself. Good luck.

To achieve lofty goals you must aspire to them, develop workable daily, monthly, quarterly plans, motivation will follow up your initial successes, and never let go of your goal...if you have to, print a huge 4.0 and stick on your bedroom door!

Good luck, hard work, future success!!

My daughter, for example, uses flash cards. That would never work for me.

So how do you find something that works for you? A lot of reflection on how you like to think, and how you best learn. So for me, I used to like to develop my own question bank. For one, developing a question bank requires really digging into the material to find the gold nuggets. Then I would ask myself questions from the question bank at random times and see what I could answer and what I could not. I would be aiming to be able to answer questions with absolute certainty, i.e., such that I would not need to confirm it being correct or not. Because the other part of my method is absolute confidence. I don't study just before an exam as this psychologically implies I don't know all of the material. During an exam, I rarely second-guess myself unless I have a very good reason to do so.

Take some time to work on yourself, go outside, go to the gym, do whatever you enjoy doing (hobbies, not doom-scrolling social media). This will definitely help with your mental state, which will in turn improve your performance in the academic side of university.

befriend your profs if possible!! still be professional ofc but remember that you don’t need to impress them. every class and assignment is a conversation where you both share knowledge and both learn from each other and both probe each other to see different things.

I acknowledge that learning method could vary depending on what programs you are in. If it’s something to do with science and math there will probably be a lot of practices to do. As I took an astronomy class as elective this winter, I browsed over all the important terms (bolded in notes) and previous exams (provided by class) prior to major tests. I got a plenty of repeated questions in my final which appeared in mock exams I took as practice, so doing practice before hand is definitely something worthy. 
As for humanities related programs, there are usually lots of assigned readings. In some cases the instructor will either explain the texts in-class or not taking them seriously at all (meaning the readings will not be tested). However you should probably read them at least in the first few weeks until becoming certain of how the instructor treats the readings. And while reading, do not just take simplified notes. Mark the page number and important quotes cus some exams may ask you to identify the quote and its author, and it would be helpful if you want to refer to any of the readings when doing paper research. 
I used to complete readings from all courses within one day or one week prior to next lectures, and it turned out to be exhausting. My suggestion is that do the reading one day prior to the class the reading is for so your mind stays fresh but not stressed. 
After each lecture, don’t just leave your notes for nothing. Compile and reorganize them so to refresh your own understanding on the context. 
When dealing with long term assignments such as research paper, draft a schedule dividing the project into phases with each working on one aspect such as “brainstorm”, “outline”, “first rough draft”, “second draft”, and “final revision”. Try to complete each phase every two to three days so as you return for the project you will find “errors” more easily. 
One more thing: take some rest! This is extremely important. Studying for continuous hours only results in nothing. Planning some free time can actually become encouraging to future learning. I’m into Genshin so much that every time there’s a big update in the game I will convince myself to complete assignments earlier so I have more time doing all those story quests😂",comment,1

Go to the lecture. You don’t want to have the first time you hear the concept be in the lecture, you want to be able to ask questions because you’ve already thought about it. Take notes.

Read the syllabus. Every time. Go to office hours and ask questions if you’re feeling stuck. 

Figure out how to best set yourself up for success in studying. Do it regularly and consistently. Get your studying done early and often, so if you choose to go out it’s already done.

I know it’s tedious and your hand feels like it’s going to fall off but it genuinely helps absorb information. I frequently rewrite everything until I can recite it out loud without looking at my notes. 

For assignments, utilize the tools accessible to you. I’m sure TA’s hate me, but I never compete essays or assignments without feedback. 

One of the most key factors that contributes to good grades in uni is time management. I set a realistic goal each day as to what I want to accomplish and do at least something every day  to stay on the ball. With that said however, you need to allocate time for yourself. Pursuing 100% academics 24/7 will make you burnout fast! So ensure that you give yourself some time as well",comment,1

For me, while I CAN cram if I need to, and have, I truly don’t retain the information as well as I do when I consistently study. And because I consistently study, I actually do have plenty of weekends and evenings off because I only need to study a small amount of content at a time. It’s what works for me.

As well, it depends on program-I’m in neuroscience and I think that with all the minute information that you have to memorize and understand, it’s quite difficult to cram. Ex. In my neuroanatomy course i had to live and breathe neuroanatomy for 4 months in order to remember all the different parts/functions/deficits, and all the work ultimately paid off with an A+ in the course.  I think without that level of effort, I would’ve done WAYYYY worse",comment,7

My biggest tip is to just study a LOT. Constantly expose yourself to the material and test yourself on the material. I would label and relabel diagrams, watch videos, take advantage if you have any lab component to see the structures in models/specimens. Eventually, the structure will click. Try your best to bring up the function of the structures you're studying when you test yourself too, if that's important for your course.",comment,1
