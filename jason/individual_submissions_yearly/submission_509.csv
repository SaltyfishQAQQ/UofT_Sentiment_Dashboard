Is it wise to keep doing full course loads or should I lower it to be better with my job schedule?

Has anyone tried working full time while taking a full time course load and making it work?",submission,45

 i’ve had a lot of breakdowns/crying/naps, and that’s only with half of a full-time working schedule. i ended most semesters with 4 courses or 5 courses including one CR/NCR, and even some with 3 courses. with a 2-10, you will not have a normal sleep or study schedule. 

 i HIGHLY DO NOT encourage doing this with a full courseload (i’m guessing you mean 5 courses) if you wanna do any decently in school and have some sanity and sleep. 3 courses may be doable, but still difficult depending on what the courses are. it’s easy to underestimate university as an incoming first year, but you’ll quickly realize how demanding it can be.  if you’re really in a tough spot financially, talk to the admissions office and see if you can defer for a year and save up. if that’s not an option, maybe do 3 or less courses alongside work and gauge how you handle the workload. good luck!",comment,40

Your grades will be terrible, your social life won't exist, and you obviously aren't going to get enough sleep.

Forget your earlier comment about ""50 percent believe that it won’t work, and 50 percent made it work"". 50% of the students at UofT can't even make it work without a job. I doubt even 1% of people could make your situation work.

Respectfully, I would also completely ignore the person who said they were able to take 6 courses while working 50 hours a week. Unless you're Albert Einstein, you WILL NOT come remotely close to a 3.97 gpa if you try that at UofT. They did that at college. UofT is not college: It's notoriously difficult.

I would likewise ignore the comment about fitting 6 courses into 2 days. That's insanely unrealistic. Even if you could make it work, you'd surely be unable to take certain courses you were actually interested in and/or courses required for your degree/POST.

If I were you, I'd (a) take fewer courses in your first semester (1-3) to see how you manage (there's not rush to graduate in 4 years) or (b) see if you can work part time with a full course load.",comment,4

But he is definitely an outlier. Motivation and energy level super high and one of those types that works out every day (for 20 years) works 10h a day full time (executive type job). Never takes breaks and doesn't even want to, fills weekend time with household /outdoor tasks. I don't know any other people like this. But if you're an outlier too, maybe?

someone else also mentioned a good point about living alone, with family and/or a partner, which can make a huge difference. if you're living alone for the first time (i'm just assuming since this is a lot of uni students' first time living away from home), it will be much harder to maintain any kind of balance in your life. again, there will be a lot more responsibilities than you think, and it's a lot to balance alongside school.

if you end up working so much, you'll have days where you wish you could study more or wish you felt well rested. i've burned out several times, and i can't wait to graduate soon. in the end, it's your own decision to make - but from personal experience, i really cannot recommend it unless this job pays incredibly well and you have to pay everything for yourself. also, OSAP is an option if you need extra funding for school.",comment,6

Put that time and energy into a startup or something with a much better input:reward ratio. 

Of course, if I’m mischaracterizing your work, maybe the value is indeed there. Just a consideration to keep in mind.",comment,2
Is working full time and doing full time student a terrible idea?,JPZ4,lah1rvl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dnx8j6/is_working_full_time_and_doing_full_time_student/lah1rvl/,1719460725.0,"40 hours a week, 60+ during busy season. 8-4:30 or 8-7 during busy season. Course timings are asynchronous or online only, 3 courses total. If the course is online I watch the lectures when I get home or listen in on them during work hours when I’m not particularly busy. (rare)

Chores are awful, maintaining your relationship is terribly difficult, hard to keep friends and interact with people.

I can’t stress enough how you don’t want to do this. I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t have to. 

Every time busy season or finals season comes around I nearly crack. The worst part is when overtime season lines up with finals season, I don’t have time for anything in life and it’s not like I’m a slow learner who needs to study a lot. 

Again, grades take a huge hit from this lifestyle.

Don’t do it.",comment,1
