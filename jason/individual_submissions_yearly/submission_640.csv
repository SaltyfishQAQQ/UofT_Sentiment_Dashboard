What makes a University of Toronto undergraduate education unique?,Usual_Law7889,1epytl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1epytl1/what_makes_a_university_of_toronto_undergraduate/,1723419147.0,"U of T has long been known for its very rigorous curriculum.  And it's arguably been watered down from the past.  Until the 1960s, they even had separate Honours and General degrees, complete with separate courses.  It was dropped for being too elitist and limiting the intelligent generalist who didn't want to commit to high specialization to the inferior degree (probably correctly).

While only a small number really have enough schools to make any sort of informed comparison, there definitely seems to be an impression that U of T courses are more rigorous than other institutions, more than both ""less selective"" schools like York and the more ""social experience"" schools like Queen's and Western.  I'm even told that the A student with a U of T BA is at about the same level as BA+MA holder in the subject from most other Canadian schools (I'll add the qualifier of ""take this with a huge grain of salt""); as one academic acquaintance says serious education in the liberal arts and sciences starts at the master's level at most Canadian universities.

So it seems to me U of T is unique in the sense that it provides perhaps the most accessible first-rate undergraduate education at a world-class research university in North America, both in terms of affordability and accessibility.  Part of the reason for the alleged U of T ""grade deflation"" (if it exists) is because so many of the students are able to accessing this high level of education, they're being graded by performance.  So think of the level of UC Berkeley (or maybe the University of Michigan?) but with a lower floor for admissions.",submission,31

The question you should be asking is why is studying here as an undergrad worth it for YOU. 


Depending on the program you choose, you'll get some of the best professors in the world teaching you. Not in terms of teaching itself, but rather their research experience, connections, and involvement with the academic field itself. Every course is an opportunity to get to interact with a professor who is a lead in some academic field, doing research you probably couldn't understand for another 7 years (depends on the subject).

Those opportunities, along with the fact that MANY of your peers will be incredibly smart and passionate, will give you a huge amount of exposure to a whole new world of thinking and achievement. It would naturally push you to get involved with research or excellence within your fields. 


All that being said, that's only if you're interested in taking advantage of those opportunities. If you're just looking for a degree, UofT doesn't actually do anything new or provide much for you to get ahead with the work industry compared to many other institutions. Naturally you'll be pushed harder here, but that's just about it. Your experience is determined by what you want to accomplish. 

You'd also be way less likely to be surrounded by people who make you feel small knowledge wise if you're not really looking for them. So what UofT is is essentially just a hub for everyone to get together. The sorts of things you get out of it are up to you.",comment,16

However, it is **your** responsibility on how you make use of the undergraduate programs. Many employers (during and after your program) look at your academic records via transcript. As well, you should take advantage of every opportunity, such as research assistant positions and executive positions within extracurricular groups. Simply graduating with no jobs, no extracurriculars, and with a low CGPA would not likely get you anywhere in terms of finding a career relevant to your field.",comment,21

One way of putting it: The U of T curriculum is basically graduate school preparation, even if that's not your ultimate destination.  That's the standard at which things are taught.  There's a reason why those who just want to pad their GPA or just want ""a degree"" are better off going elsewhere.",comment,1
