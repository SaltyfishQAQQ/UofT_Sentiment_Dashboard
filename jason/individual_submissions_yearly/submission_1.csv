License plates usually get redesigned every few years for each province, and the Ford government wanted to have a go at it. They were gassing them up so much because it was such a dramatic change (I personally think the Blue background was chosen to make the conservatives blue colour more obvious, since Ontario license plates have generally stuck to a white background with blue lettering), but then they rolled them out and they turned out to be completely illegible at night because the blue/reflectiveness washed out the serial. There was a lot of backlash and mockery from everyone, so those plates only lasted for a couple months, hence the limited serials you see with them. They’re still valid tho, and the governments just waiting for them to slowly disappear instead of recalling all of them, despite the safety issues with them. They also can’t be read by cameras/sensors so that’s totally fun and safe. My fav part is how the government tried to play it off saying it was only under specific circumstances they were hard to read, yet those circumstances were practically every circumstance.
