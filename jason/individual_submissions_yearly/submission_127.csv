> Opposition NDP Leader Marit Stiles said she disagrees with the university appealing to the courts for an injunction, saying, “This is a peaceful protest. The students have the right to protest and the University of Toronto would be better off actually negotiating with the students.”

> In 2017, the Canadian Labour Congress passed a resolution to push the federal government to support Palestinian prisoners, who were on hunger strike seeking better treatment and an end to Israel’s practice of detention without trial.

> Canadian trade unionists had not shied away from wading into controversy. They joined the anti-war cause in the 1960s, demanding the Canadian government stop the flow of arms to Vietnam. And in the 1970s and ‘80s, thousands took part in anti-Apartheid movements to persuade the government to take action against South Africa.

Important note, this is general members meeting. Only members attending will be allowed to vote.

> “Our job is to put our bodies in between you and whatever the administration brings to you,” JP Hornick, president, Ontario Public Service Employees’ Union (OPSEU).


> Laura Walton, president of the Ontario Federation of Labour (OFL), pledged not only her union membership in defence of the protesters, but her own maternal instinct. “I’m the proud mother of one of these young women,” she said. “So I stand here as your mom. And momma bears are hard to get through, just so you know.”


Glad to see labour movements are thriving in Ontario and speaking with conscience.

Edit: since you think they are “sticking their noses where they don’t belong” They specifically explained why:


> Walton said that, in her mind, support for the protesters is undeniably linked to labour issues.
> “If the university administrators can get away with trampling on your rights to protest and dismissing your legitimate demands, then employers everywhere will feel emboldened to do the same,” she said.

> More broadly, Walton said that, in her view, Palestinian issues clearly affect workers in Canada. She said political instability and violence in the region disrupts global supply chains and can drive up costs here at home, from the gas pump to the grocery store. 
> “If you really wanted to fight inflation and the cost of living crisis, then quit cheerleading the war in Gaza and demand a ceasefire.”",comment,24

> Amnesty International is continuing to investigate dozens of attacks in Gaza. This output focuses on five unlawful attacks which struck residential buildings, a refugee camp, a family home and a public market. The Israeli army claims it only attacks military targets, but in a number of cases Amnesty International found no evidence of the presence of fighters or other military objectives in the vicinity at the time of the attacks. Amnesty International also found that the Israeli military failed to take all feasible precautions ahead of attacks including by not giving Palestinian civilians effective prior warnings – in some cases they did not warn civilians at all and in others they issued inadequate warnings.

> Direct attacks on civilians or civilian objects are prohibited and are war crimes. Indiscriminate attacks – those which fail to distinguish as required – are also prohibited. Where an indiscriminate attack kills or injuries civilians, it amounts to a war crime. Disproportionate attacks, those where the expected harm to civilians and civilian objects is excessive in comparison with the “concrete and direct military advantage anticipated,” also are prohibited.

There needs to be a clear, simple, direct course of action that people can get behind. One that should be very difficult to argue against. You don't want to just get in people's way and then fall over when you're asked to justify what to accomplish, that'll either piss them off even more, or worse, it'll make them just dismiss you and your protest as naive and pointless. You want to get in people's way while making them aware of something they did not know, and giving them a course of action. Essentially the goal of a protest is not to just be disruptive, it's to convince people that something sufficiently bad is happening that *they* should be disruptive.

The current UofT protest amounts to ""tell us what we should be angry about, and then if you're doing it then stop, also Palestine yay!"" The thing is, that's not really an actionable cause, at least not in the minds of most normal adults.

The instant the first word of the catchy slogan became ""divulge"" is the instant that it was clear to me the protest would go nowhere. It basically tells anyone watching from the sidelines that they didn't even bother to do enough homework to come up with specific demands, and instead they expect the university to work with them to help them figure out what they should be protesting.

A protest should be simple enough that even a child can understand what they want, and how that makes the world better. The complaint here is ""we paid the university money for an education, and then the university might have taken some of that money and invested it into an investment fund, and that investment fund might have invested in a company that supports Israel, and Israel is doing horrific things in Palestine, and because of that we want the university to tell us where it might have invested the money we paid them, so that we can tell them not to invest into those entities."" That... Doesn't really roll of the tongue. It's also extremely unlikely to happen, given the degrees of separation between the university and the people managing it's trust. Simply put, this just isn't structured like a successful protest.

It would also help if the encampment was genuinely abuzz with activity all the time, at least enough to attract the news. If there were hundreds of people there at all time, all calling for a single thing that the universe could actually do, which most people would agree was the moral course of action, then it might have been different. However, if the protest really amounts to, ""come in, set up a tent, stop by every few days to make sure it's still there"" while a few people stick around to talk to any passerby's, then that's not really a protest, it's more of a impromptu festival in support of Palestine.",comment,5

>**An international consensus exists among States, as well as the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), that the Fourth Geneva Convention of August 12, 1949 relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War (as well as the Hague Regulations of 1907) is fully applicable to all the territories occupied by Israel in 1967.** As such, the entire international community (except the occupying Power) considers the Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, along with the other Arab territories occupied by Israel in 1967, to be ""occupied territories"" subject to international humanitarian law. The U.N. Security Council has confirmed the applicability of the 4th Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem, in 25 resolutions. 


> Israel, however, refuses to accept the de jure applicability of the 4th Geneva Convention to the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including Jerusalem **and has committed serious violations of every relative provision of the Convention.** At the start of the occupation, Israel, the occupying Power, immediately began imposing countless repressive measures, such as administrative detention, deportation, home demolitions and other forms of collective punishment, against the Palestinian civilian population in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, inflicting enormous suffering and harm on them.


> The occupying Power has also attempted to change the status of the occupied territory or parts of it and to change the demographic composition of the territory through the illegal confiscation of land and the transfer of Israeli civilians. The occupying Power has repeatedly attempted to justify many of these measures by citing its security considerations or military needs. For years, the Israeli Government claimed that the illegal Jewish settlements were built to serve security needs and considerations. 


> In reality, however, the occupying Power has been driven by an expansionist vision or ideology and, using its enormous military capabilities and a complex system of economic, legal and administrative policies and practices, has fervently pursued the implementation of this vision. Another fundamental aim of the occupying Power has been to prevent the realization of Palestinian national rights. The result of these measures has in fact been a gradual change in the situation in the Palestinian territory to that of one under active colonization.

Basically any time the IDF crosses a line (which is saying a lot considering the atrocities they commit on a daily basis), they conduct an “internal investigation” and “punish” one or two people and get away with it to oppress another day. The only way any sort of justice can be administered is through the ICC and ICJ.
