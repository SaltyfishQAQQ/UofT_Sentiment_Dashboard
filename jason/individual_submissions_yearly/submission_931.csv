I wanted to go around the U of T campus since its soo big and is waay better than Waterloos. However, most of the buildings are locked and I need to scan a card to go in. I was wondering if there was any guest card that I can get to access the buildings to study for the term (I don't need to use any of the gym facilities).",submission,16

I don't go to campus much but I don't ever recall having to scan my card to enter a building (aside from entering some specific rooms).

  
Check out the Bahen or Myhall buildings, they shouldn't require card access.",comment,22

The same group who set up the encampment actually did a sit-in inside a building a couple months back, so it's not an unreasonable fear.  After the injunction, I suspect the buildings will be back to being open again.

The exception is the library - that was open as well until 2020, but there were safety issues related to both voyeurs and a situation with a homeless man threatening students.  It's a shame, but they have gated the library since.",comment,8

It's a fantastic place to work.  [https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/torontoreferencelibrary/](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/torontoreferencelibrary/)  And, of course, you're right next door to the Lillian Smith library which is nice but smaller and more heavily used by the community (hence noisier).  

Of course, Lillian Smith has two great special collections (Merrill and Osborne) if you'd like to sit and read some amazing stuff [https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/lillianhsmith/](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/lillianhsmith/) where else can you actually read a copy of Tailspin Tommy on the mountain of human sacrifice? :) [https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2946841&R=2946841](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDM2946841&R=2946841) and or Baron Munchausen stories?
