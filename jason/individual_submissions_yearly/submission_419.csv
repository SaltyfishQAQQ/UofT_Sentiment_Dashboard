"Yes, it is a scam email: What to look out for to avoid being grifted",RJean83,1ellqnc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ellqnc/yes_it_is_a_scam_email_what_to_look_out_for_to/,1722960507.0,"Welcome, if you are new to the U of T email system you have now joined an email system with literally hundreds of thousands of other people. And you will be receiving so many scam emails that you will be shocked when you get a legit message.

Please look out for the following scams, they are some of the most common.

1. ""Your email is being suspended or discontinued, give your info to us and we will keep it going!"" That never happens. If U of T decides to delete your email they will just be warning you months in advance. There is never a renewal process.

2. Job Opportunity you never applied for: You are offered a job or an application for a job. They tell you it is easy money, only a few hours a week and you work from home. They never tell you what the job is, or specifically who it is for. They want your bank or email info.

3. Offer of any money or scholarship that can't be verified from an outside source. If you didn't apply for that scholarship, or it didn't come directly from your college or department, it is a scam.

4. ""They have your private secret details and will blackmail you in bitcoin"". They never hack into your computer. They have nothing on you. They may list an old password on there to trick you but if they could they would have hacked your bank account.

5. This is your professor. Only email me at this address. I need your help, and by help I mean gift cards.

  
Signs to watch out for-

1. You don't know the person emailing you. Lots of scammers will use a u of t email to look legit. But google the email. The admin assistant of the department of architecture is not emailing you with a job, they just borrowed her email.

2. Grammar and spelling errors. This is a prestigious school. They can afford auto-correct. Also look for any cash amounts that use USD. We are Canadian, and will only use CAD when talking money.

3. They insist on only that email address. Jobs, scholarships, tech issues, all have an email that can be easily found and a phone number somewhere, and there is often a generic department email instead of a specific person unless you know that person already. 

4. They ask for your password or personal info. THE SCHOOL ALREADY HAS YOUR SSN, YOUR PHONE NUMBER, YOUR BANKING INFO. THEY DON'T NEED TO ASK AGAIN.

  
Report the emails as phishing with the red flag icon, and delete. Never reply to them, you are just showing them it is an active email and someone wants to engage with them. ",submission,58

However in those circumstances, you simply need to do so the same way you change any piece of information for the school; through Acorn. Or alternatively by calling the registrar

In either case, go onto Google (or your search engine of choice), and find the access for Acorn or the number for the registrar yourself; do not click any links on the email, or call any of the numbers provided.",comment,6

I've had this done since I started at UofT and did not have any issues with phising emails. I tried to make a PSA post but it keeps getting removed :(

- Search up utorID management

- under ""Make Changes"" select ""change Legacy UTORmail options""

- login and scroll down

- check off ""Do not list <your email> in the directory and hide from the GAL""

The one disadvantage is that you will have to write out your email in full for new colleagues since they can't search you up. But it's a minor trade off.

I think it would be really help for a lot of people, I'd really appreciate it if you could spread the message!",comment,3
