This absolutely gutted me and I don’t know how to proceed. I’ve overall been struggling mentally this semester which messed with my preformance, haven’t been able to attend classes due to depression, however I’m not officially diagnosed with anything, so I’m unsure if I’m able to do anything to pettetion this suspension. It feels like a year of my life has gone to waste and I have a very strict household who will not take this lightly, I’m freaking out and have no idea how to proceed, any help appreciated.",submission,158

You're on 'watch' for a year, and if grades slip, you are put on suspension.

If you were not able to attend classes due to depression, I would take the suspension as a sign to seek help, improve your mental health, and return to UofT the year afterwards with a refreshed mind. I understand that your family may be upset, but you're an adult who should be able to live your life the way that you want. Your health and mental wellness always comes first!

I had a 1.7 in my first year (barely missing probation), and I ultimately graduated with honours and a GPA of 3.7+ for my last three years of uni (1.7, 3.0, 3.75, 4.0, 3.7 were my annual GPAs). After first year, I can count on one hand the amount of classes I missed. I also never missed an office hour. UofT is competitive, and a real shift in grades requires real change.

In my own case, I had to postpone my studies over five times because of multiple surgeries (rheumatoid arthritis in both hands). I used to be a kinda pro piano player. Maybe a bit of my own experience is something that you can extrapolate to your case.

Is it ideal? Maybe now you see is not. Try not to explain, there are multiple factors behind low grades, and you can use this suspension as a time to rewire your head. Maybe talk to a professional psychologist about anything you feel is causing low grades (not feeling capable, anxiety, low concentration, etc). Here I am mentioning very general issues because I am not a qualified professional to asses what led to this.

  
Take this time, and use it to go back to square zero. You can use this suspension as a time to improve and then come back, or decide to switch programs, or something else but in a new light.

Secondly, how does your marks drop this far without seeking academic help? 

You should have been utilizing CR/NCR, drop deadlines, LWDs etc. At the very least, consider switching to part time studies or take a voluntary semester off for health concerns. As other people have mentioned, recovering your gpa after a couple bad marks gets difficult. But what is done is done.

Take this as a learning lesson, maybe consider all your options before going back to full time studies.  My personal advice is to book a couple meetings w some academic advisors and discuss your current options. 

For anyone reading this, I cannot stress enough how easy it is to avoid failing a course. It is also much better to have an LWD in a course, and have it not affect your cgpa than take a 0.0 gpa and have a fail in the course.",comment,5

Here were the steps I took that changed my life and I would strongly recommend you give it a shot. You can change your life in 8 months and I mean YOU specifically can do it. Just don’t give up.

Step 1: Begin therapy with either a psychotherapist or psychologist, if you have problems other than depression they’ll help you find the proper help, if it’s depression they’ll also be able to help you. They’ll also diagnose you, which can be brought to your school to help you with some accommodations upon return.

Step 2: Begin a light workout routine and make a habit of getting sunlight the first hour or two of waking up. This obviously isn’t a cure all but theres some studies that indicate working out and sunlight exposure in the morning are great ways to help combat depression.

Step 3: Spend some time reflecting on what you can improve: study habits, sleep habits, eating habits maybe review some of the content as you approach the 8 month mark.

Final step: DO SOMETHING YOU ENJOY during the summer/ time off, maybe a sport, maybe get a job and do some travel or save so you don’t have to work during the year, but find some way that helps you decompress and prepare you for your return.

Don’t give up, it’s a minor setback for a major comeback!",comment,3

It sounds like your home life is at least part of the problem, having a setback shouldn’t send fear through your spine. 

I would suggest taking the break to think about your plans and what you need to make them happen. First, going undiagnosed for mental health is not a good plan. Depression is can be preceded by anxiety (unmanaged anxiety can lead to learned helplessness, similar features as depression). Get that sorted. 

Second, take a look at what got you where you are AFTER your depression is handled. Right now your brain is lying to you a lot. 

Then, get a therapist and work with them on your needs and where you want to go. 

A healthy family should be prepared to help you with all of that. If they try to stop you, you need to find a way to get it done alone. 

The 8 month break can be good for you, that’s why they do it. I was .1 of a GPA from my own probation. Turned out I had undiagnosed ADHD which caused major anxiety issues and made focus impossible. Dealt with it, now I’m doing a PhD.",comment,2

The suspension was inevitable for me and I think it is gonna be the same for you to. I came back after a year and i slowly adjusted myself back. I will be entering my fourth year in september.

I know that really sucks cause I have been there and I have done that including the family drama. The last thing you should worry about is your family response because that has nothing to do with the problem. Your mental health and study habit does. So focus on that area and see what you can improve. 

The only advice I can give you is to work on what was holding you back and come back stronger. Try to work and deal with your menatal and physical health in the suspension year. It will get easier day by day. Now because you just received the news it will be hard but hold on and don't give up Darling. You can DM me if you want as well. Stay Strong❤❤❤",comment,2

I’m sorry to hear this happened to you. I went through something similar, though I was notified I was on probation prior both times. I ended up in academic suspension twice due to low grades. Mental health was an issue for me, but I was in denial that my bad habits were not a cause as well. You can try to fight the status with your school if you have good reason (if your unofficial transcript doesn’t show, idk what else), but honestly speaking, if it’s because of mental health, take the 8 months off.

I’m not going to sugarcoat and say it’s a blessing in disguise, but what these 8 months turn out to be are entirely up to you. Of course, take some time to process it, but at the end of the day, how you spend your time these next 8 months is crucial. 

First, prioritize yourself and your health. Go on walks, take in nature, go out with your friends/family, do the things that were hard to do because of the time crunch in uni. Make the time for the important things in life, and I’m sure you’ll feel some level of peace

Secondly, ask yourself if you really want to do this program. If you don’t, you can always try to pivot to something else. 

If you do want to do this, try and spend some time doing some valuable projects to help you get into touch with your program (if engineering, do something like programming a Pokédex, CAD of a Batmobile, traffic light circuit, etc. If marketing, look into social media trends, SEO optimization projects, Google Analytics 4, etc. the list goes on depending on your major)

The best thing you can do for yourself is not give up. Life will throw challenges like this, and it’ll feel overwhelming and crushing. But don’t let it take over, persevere and try your best, and you’ll make it. When you make it past that final stretch, no matter how long it takes, and no matter how self conscious you may feel because it took you a bit longer, there’s nothing better than the feeling in your head where you realize “I made it”.

I didn’t have depression per se but was distracting myself with trying to be a musician/working part time but 30 hours/week (was a super early morning shift 4 am in retail) from issues with a big break up and some deaths in the family.  So yeah, I was so out of it, would sleep in lectures, never study, one course I knew I wanted to drop but wound up forgetting to drop in time so got like 30%.

Shit happens. I take responsibility for it and learned from that failure. 

I quit trying to be a musician and trying to find a rebound love interest. And when I was allowed back I still graduated with honours… which really isn’t shit at U f T but considering how low I was… it’s somewhat meaningful…

I also became super fit; working the body helps your brain. 

Anyhow, you’re not the first/last person this happened to, and it happens more often than you think. In my time, most ppl just said “I’m taking a year off” meanwhile they’re suspended for failing probation. Also, many ppl who never even got suspended still took 5 years to complete a 4 year degree and they weren’t even working anywhere. 

You’re gonna be alright. You’re gonna see if you were made for university or not. I’d consider petitioning and finding a way to deal with your depression… there’s a major shift happening (US empire is in decline, we’re in the midst of the 4th industrial revolution/transhumanism) so mental health is going to be a lot more important… who knows… maybe we’ll find alien tech that we fly with just our minds/thoughts… depression and distraction may not be suitable for such things 😉.

Regardless, don’t just sit and wallow, learn from your failure. I went on to the military, and it was all about seeing how troops deal with stress and failure.",comment,1

What happened to me is that I realized I really need a break for myself, take a step back from academia and look at myself and my own life, and think about what I want? I don’t really have an answer still, but it’s about taking the time to really learn to take care of yourself, learn to sleep well, eat well, rest well, learn to cut yourself some slack when you fail, learn to be more gentle with yourself even when you fail, but recuperate tmrw and try it again. Talk to friends, relatives, other people you respect look up to, and feel safe to communicate with. Do some light studying if you want to practice building a good studying habit, maybe start a workout routine, get a part time job, try shit, work on emotional regulation and being more aware of what you’re thinking and feeling. 

I’m sorry to hear that you have a strict household, but I hope that your family can find a way to communicate to each other as a TEAM, too often parents work against the child rather than helping their kid achieve a goal together.

Checkout videos from the YouTube channel, healthygammergg, they cover a lot of topic but most importantly failing in life and catching up and it really helped me.

Focus on one thing at a time there is no point of thinking about the distant future. Focus on the small things, make changes and overtime it will compound. Best of luck !",comment,1

I nearly failed 3 out of 4 classes during my first year in college and it completely crushed me to the point I had nightmares about it for months, a year later I got Dean’s list :D

It was a big big shock to me at the time but I took that opportunity to figure out the method of studying that really worked for me and started to improve my marks through a lot of dedicated study time.

Reprimanded yes, but death I don’t think so. So yes, the worst outcome is death and OP’s fear is worse than the outcome. I used to be just as scared to approach my family with issues like this, but I realized soon enough that if they love you they won’t do anything to hurt you and I think OP being in uni is a sign that they probably don’t want to hurt them, and love them instead. Only suggestion is - you’re an adult now - you have the right to your choices and you have to bear the outcome. If OP approached the conversation this way or in a way like this, that might be the start of a new outlook their loved ones will have of them - a chance you’ll have to take anyway. Failures don’t define you, but the lessons you learn and apply from them define you. As long as there’s life, there’s always hope is what the comment meant I assume. OP if you get this far in this thread - you got this ! Plan the conversation well and provide a contingency plan for the year following the 8 months along with a plan for the 8 months and they’ll probably just hold you to it. That’s where all the advice comes in as mentioned above. Take time to rethink … etc. Also use the time to get assessed regarding learning difficulties or other conditions with a chat with your program advisors as they might be able to suggest ways you could approach the years after the 8 months away, so that you don’t end up in this situation again. They will be a lot more empathetic to you than you might think. Just as well - This might be something you want to do before you speak with your family as it will help you draft up your plan that you will present to them as well.",comment,0

For example, I cannot study. The idea of sitting down and going through notes for hours is useless. However, I'm killer at retaining information from lectures. My brain works so fast that I can easily keep huge amounts of info there, so long as I pay attention. My hyper focus saves my ass when my ADHD procrastination tries to kill it. Making myself accountable to others means that I won't let myself procrastinate too much. 

Things like getting enough sleep and making sure I eat / drink are crucial so I can do that.  I'm also using an app called Finch that really helps me to get done what I need to.

Definitely visit learning services. Get every accomodation you are entitled to. If I had done that in my undergrad, my average would have been very different.",comment,2

It’s crazy how university kids with zero life experience seem to think they know literally everything about everything 

If getting a job at Maccas was so easy then why do you have 16/17/18 year old kids who can’t find seem to find employment in industries like fast food?

“…university kids with zero life experience seem to think they know literally everything about everything.” 

That my friend, is youth. I see a lot of posts like how you described on here. They are trying to gain life experience. My only problem is when they are unkind. Otherwise, I try to be patient and helpful because I was once like them too. But it all works out. 

Totally anecdotal, but I went to school at UofT on a student visa (I live in the States). I was not legally allowed to work. I could work on campus part time and I could work full time in the Summer (with an additional work permit), but that was it. Honestly, it was too much hassle I didn’t bother. Maybe it has changed? It’s been about 10 years.",comment,1
