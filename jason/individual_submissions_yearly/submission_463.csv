Like full on blowing bubbles and squishing it in between his fingers and putting it back into his mouth omg. O MG it was genuinely horrifying and disgusting and btw this went on for like an hour before I just couldnâ€™t do it anymore. Please stop playing with the gum in your mouth!! Chew with your mouth closed!! Donâ€™t intertwine it in between your fingers!! ðŸ˜µ,submission,50
