Got an AO for possession of unauthorized aid during exam,lilderkyderk,1h8doeq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h8doeq/got_an_ao_for_possession_of_unauthorized_aid/,1733524328.0,"Long story short I had my AirPods in my pocket and near the end of my exam I came back from the washroom when a TA asked me what was in my pockets. I obviously know that it‚Äôs dumb but I‚Äôm short on sleep and was stressed so it genuinely slipped my mind that it was still on me.
Has anyone gone through a similar experience? What punishment did they impose? Who should I reach out to and what steps do I take from here?
Any advice would be appreciated.",submission,56

In your case, the equivalent of a ""legal"" question may be whether you ""ought reasonably to have known"" you had the airpods on you \[based on their definition of the word ""knowingly"" in the offence description\]. Also, it may (or may not) be worth bringing up that you didn't actually have any way of utilizing the ""unauthorized aid"" with airpods but no phone. You said you had an invigilator with you in the washroom, so that might help too.

This is a repository of previous decisions made by the Governing Council of UofT. Only about like 5% of academic offences, if not less, make it there. Most of the time students come to some sort of deal with the University. Search offence keyword ""unauthorized aid."" I wasn't able to find any previous decisions involving just airpods and no phone.",comment,2
