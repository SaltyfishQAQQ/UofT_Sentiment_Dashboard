I‚Äôm thinking about taking families in canada in night school. I really wanna take it in day school but bc of scheduling conflicts, I cant (philosophy and FIC are at the same time) last year in APS I had a 92 so would it be okay if I take it during night school and get like a 97? I think that‚Äôs the highest I can do. I‚Äôm just worried that taking night school would be a problem because of like the grade discrepancy.",submission,29

If not it doesn't matter. And what program are you applying to? Uft generally doesn't care even if there is a ""high grade discrepancy"" if its for a non-competitive program.",comment,11

I did Families in Canada online in my first semester, and philosophy at my actual school that same term. I also did IAPS in grade 11. 

My admission requirements was: 6 U/M level courses, 1 of which has to be ENG4 and the other 5 being your highest marks. 

I had between 90-100 in those 3 courses as my final mark; you‚Äôll be fine!",comment,1

Private night schools are notorious for churning out grades and with all else being equal, just going to that night class for your 97 will rule against you if it's between you and another individual.¬†


Make a choice - philosophy or families. But I don't see why you think you HAVE to take it. You can take a course like it at university.",comment,0

If someone with a high average got rejected, there were probably other factors that made them get rejected. Try your best of course, but don't stress too much! A 5% grade discrepancy is not serious enough for them to reject you for",comment,2
