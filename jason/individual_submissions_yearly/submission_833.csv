Is it just me or have grade returns been very slow this semester?,hebra_ml,1h0y2ur,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h0y2ur/is_it_just_me_or_have_grade_returns_been_very/,1732689113.0,I feel like I have had to wait significantly longer for marks this semester compared to my previous four semesters. In some courses I have been waiting over a month for the grade back. And it's not even on assignments that are large. Is anyone else experiencing this? Does anyone know why?,submission,19

Very few people, if anyone is taking exactly the same courses in exactly the same sections. My experience is completely separate than yours and yours is completely different than mine. And In my experience, this year as a fourth year Iâ€™ve never had grades returned faster and for the first time ever it feels like my profs care about us",comment,1
