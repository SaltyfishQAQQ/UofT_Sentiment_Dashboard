I knew I gained weight, but it turns out I weigh WAY more than I thought I did, a whopping 20 lbs (and I‚Äôm really short so it makes a big difference). 

now I‚Äôm very worried about my gown not fitting or having it look like a bodycon dress on me üíÄ I fear I won‚Äôt be able to zip it up especially bc I‚Äôm kind of busty. does anyone have any experience with this? If it doesn‚Äôt fit, would I be able to wear the gown unzipped the whole time? my convocation is on Monday btw (I‚Äôm cooked)
