There are plenty of black students coming from the Caribbean and Africa who are ***very*** well off, but they would get preferential access to this class and other opportunities over this Vietnamese student - who literally lived in **a** **fucking homeless shelter** - based 100% on the color of their skin.

Since the point of this course is to expose at-risk black students to successful black university students it‚Äôs fairly logical why you would be asked to unenroll if you are not black. There is more than ample evidence that same-race pairing with mentors is more effective than mixed-race pairings.

All of this is quite logical (minus the ROs repeated failings), but it has clearly not stopped you from stripping the situation of context and starting a race-based pearl clutching thread. If the course instructor needed evidence that you were unsuitable for the course/placement, then you could not have handed it to them more effectively. Bravo.",comment,28

Heterosexual, financially stable, White and white passing people are the majority for who society is made for and caters to (within the U.S). Because of these, despite racial integration (or becauseof its recency) POC are often and casually overlooked in society. This means lack of representation, consideration, and equity. 

In order to combat this issue (that occurs for any sort of marginalized group), opportunities are given to specific marginalized groups so that they feel welcomed, included, and equal to someone like them who can understand their experiences. It's not about other assets out side of the targeted specific trait of a group of people .

As for breeding hate, you‚Äôre logic on this would only apply in a world where the obvious events didn‚Äôt occur(you know what I mean) these events were more hateful, destructive, and destabilized generations of people to come, that to me is whole multitude worse than a class being geared towards POC.
