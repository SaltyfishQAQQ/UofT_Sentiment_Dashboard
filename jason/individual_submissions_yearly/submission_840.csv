Feeling overwhelmed with university and I don’t know what to do,throwRA1929228,1fzls51,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fzls51/feeling_overwhelmed_with_university_and_i_dont/,1728458394.0,"I’m only a first year and I’m so stuck and unhappy with the way my life is going. I’ve come to the conclusion that I am unhappy with the courses I’m taking, but I can’t even drop or switch out because it’s too late in the semester and I don’t even know what I would be doing instead. 

I get so exhausted from just studying and traveling to classes all the time. I’ve stopped attending my lectures because I can’t keep focused on any of the materials being taught (I know it’s bad to do so), and I just feel so overwhelmed with the work I already have. I feel homesick and alone so often even though I have many friends already. 

I can’t even sleep well because I’m just stressed about the possibility that I’m wasting money on my tuition. I have no firm idea what major I want to pursue and I just feel like an idiot. I’m so stressed out about midterms and the prospect of not earning a high GPA. 

I don’t really know what to do. I’ve reached out to a learning strategist and got waitlisted by a month, I’ve reached out to some campus resources and I’ve only been redirected to other resources. I feel like I’m being pulled in all sorts of directions. 

If there is any advice upper year students could give I would really appreciate it. ",submission,19
Feeling overwhelmed with university and I don’t know what to do,HopliteOracle,lr2hoq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fzls51/feeling_overwhelmed_with_university_and_i_dont/lr2hoq1/,1728468186.0,"Future planning:

Look at GPA requirements of many graduate schools/professional schools. Don’t limit the types professions, it’s just a google search. Many only look at the last two years/best two years. Try finding which ones seem more lenient on superficial items like GPA, or undergraduate program name. You will be surprised on what you find. If there are GPA minimums, many have an alternative methods, like letters of reference, undergrad research.

Financial pressure:

Consider doing part-time studies. You will only be charged per course. If you have OSAP, funding might be affected. Your academic ‘year’ is actually based on how many credits you have earned, not actual year. (Check the website of your division to be sure)

Peer/family pressure:

Don’t get pressured/ashamed when others graduate faster than you. Way too many people are in your situation. Cramming every exam, chasing GPA, graduate, “university was just a blur, I didn’t even remember anything”, lingering impostor syndrome, grinding interviews, burning out, etc. The herd is trying to speed-run a midlife crisis. Don’t imitate it.

Study strategy:

1. Sleep. Study until perfection, sleep, try without any aid. Your mind is in a blank state after you wake up. It’s a really easy way to simulate an exam, because you won’t know what the questions are. If you can’t sleep you can try studying some different section, and flip back once your mind is fully reset. Make sure you don’t have access to previous answers.

2. Know when to use hints. Take a hint when it is needed. My rule is to take hints of definitions if it doesn’t ring a bell at all (no examples at all come up either).

Logic/proof should be even stricter. Only limit yourself to the most unintuitive step, and take a peak only for that one step. Highlight it and try to see if there is a similar pattern in other questions.

3. Be efficient. Some things are less confusing than others. If you are immediately confused by some concept, this is the most important thing to take note of. Quickly write down exactly and honestly why it shouldn’t make sense in your own words. Don’t embellish, or add additional reasoning on top of it. At the end, you should be able to look back and disprove these so they won’t conflict with you actually learn. If they don’t seem to be resolvable, clear it up with the teacher.

If you don’t know why you are confused, you need to disagree/doubt what is being taught more. Your doubt should be based on what was previously taught or what you already know. You should be willing to change your mind, but only after a (logical) fight. The socratic method is the best way. Don’t be discouraged if what you actually know is very basic.

If discussing with a teacher, remember to be polite, but use their words/common knowledge against them. Perhaps a term used in a lesson contradicts something in the textbook in their syllabus. They have academic freedom, so you can’t compare them with anything outside, it is a waste of time. But the bare minimum is they have to be consistent, and that’s fair game.

Practice confidence and self-respect by taking academic risks. Debating, blind diving into advanced material, accessing academic literature and trying to understand topics slightly beyond your expertise are all examples of this.",comment,14

Fear of hating what you’re doing and hating what you amount to in the future because of it is real and I understand you so incredibly. I have no interest in school or any of this. but i guess we have to understand that we’re just doing it for the degree so we can get outta here. don’t think about the future or how you’ll feel then, just live in the moment. do what the day demands of you. try and attending your classes especially if you have nothing better to do. even if you can’t focus just go. 

i force myself to go everyday and i do my best not to complain so i don’t make this resentment tangible. and it helps. 

i’ve also been taking ashwaganda as i beleive it helps my cortisol levels. maybe it does idk all i know is that im feeling better than i was a week ago. 

and other than that, just be at peace with it. that’s all this amounts to. come to peace with where you are, with what your doing. and if not that then come to peace with what you wanna do. accept that some things are out of your hands. 

hmm maybe this was more self-reflective than helpful, i’m rlly srry about that. 

but my advice is maybe talk to some kinda mental health services, bc yeah school is the central stress factor, but it’s your mental health that’s the main picture here. something isn’t right in how your feeling, being in school just adds or takes away from that feeling. so talk about your feelings maybe contact someone. it’s easier said than done, but idk. anyway, understand that this will pass. the time will pass, the term will end, the year will end…. you just gotta live through it",comment,5

I was in this exact position this time last year. I was studying humanities and hated it, and I couldn't motivate myself to do anything because I had no direct goal I wanted to achieve. I kept thinking 'why am I even here. I don't belong here' and I was sent into a massive spiral about my life and what I wanted to do and who I wanted to be. And it's a lot for someone our age to decide, we are so young!! There has always been pressure and the expectation that you need to go into university with a plan, but I suggest viewing it as a stepping stone, a new opportunity to learn about the world and about yourself. I switched over to life sciences this year, so I'm basically redoing my first year again. And yes sometimes I feel behind, and yes sometimes I wonder if I made the right choice. And honestly, there isn't really a 'right' choice it's just what is best for you. I have a plan now, and it actually has nothing to do with science. I actually plan on going into the military, but to do so I still need a degree. So I'm going to just do what I enjoy, and that's the best anyone can do.

First year is extremely overwhelming, especially at a school like this in a big city, with loads of people and extremely high standards. You will struggle, your GPA most likely won't be great (mine definitely wasn't) but that doesn't mean your world is over! It's really just beginning. University is such a small time in our big life span. you don't have to have it all figured out, you don't have to have anything figured out. Most jobs need degrees, but some (like the military) don't really care what you major in! So explore different courses, try new things, and stick with what you enjoy, because that is what you will do best in.

  
And remember, while learning, schoolwork and grades are important, they aren't everything. Take care of yourself first, and just do the best you can. Its okay to not be perfect and it's okay to struggle, one cannot be first in everything. It's hard to remember sometimes but just keep going and pushing through, everything will fall into place exactly as it should.

You've got this.",comment,3

If it’s feasible financially, don’t stress about reducing to 4 (even 3) courses and possibly taking an extra year. I’m in 4th year and my mental health, as well as my approach to school, have improved drastically since I stopped putting that pressure on myself. You have until after reading week to drop courses– you don’t necessarily have to be “doing something instead” either, if it means you get a bit more sleep, study more for your other courses, and take a bit of time for yourself. The last thing you’d want is to focus all of your time on being perfect and then burning out before your undergrad is even over.

As for worrying that you’re wasting time and money, I personally think most people figure it out as they go. I switched majors (stayed within social sciences tho) because I came to realize I was studying something I thought I should, rather than what I wanted and what was realistic for me and my abilities. It’s obviously not ideal to graduate in something you hated for 4+ years, but try not to stress about things that haven’t even happened. You might end up enjoying it!

Lastly I want to mention that you should take advantage of your registrar in case you haven’t already. It sometimes depends on your college, but most of them are really kind and supportive. You might be able to ask them to help you come up with a plan for the next few years in terms of mapping your degree. Honestly I’ve gone to mine just to get some validation for my stress, lol. She was really nice and just gave me a listening ear.

Just remember that it’ll be okay. It’s school, not a race ❤️",comment,1
