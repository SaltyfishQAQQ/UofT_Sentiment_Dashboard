I‚Äôd rather have midterms over with, rather than constantly having to study or review or stress over midterms during a week long break. 

With that being said, most other universities also do finish their midterms before their reading week; so technically in that case we just pulled the shorter stick. 

Oh well, gotta deal with what we get lmao.",comment,6

Although I dont understand why a ton of people think reading week is a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù. Yes its a break in the sense we don‚Äôt have to go to class, but its not a break for course content. Reading week gives us a chance to catch up on course material we‚Äôre behind in. It‚Äôs a plus if midterms is before so you dont have to stress out about studying for midterms during the reading week, although for those who need to catch up and have midterms after reading week, gives them the opportunity to study for and do well on their midterms. Definitely subjective tho.",comment,6
