Owner from the Caffe'in here - Sorry for the inconvenience. The reason that we don't give physical-copy receipt to customers is because we have limited space in our truck, it is really hard to fit in a receipt printer beside the POS machine. I remember you ordered a coconut latte. I am attaching your receipt[ here that i found from the back office](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a0BCGTHkzUIGEtgp0tBkNZLClZcVnqEB/view?usp=sharing). Please message me if the last 4 digit of your card is incorrect and I'll send yours to you. Generally, we can email receipt to customers if our customers ask for. If you need, i can make you an invoice, feel free to send me your email. 

Best,",comment,3
