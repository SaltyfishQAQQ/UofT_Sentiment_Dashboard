"I canâ€™t focus, do you want to go to a cafe and work in silence together?",mcroobie,1ft4nu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ft4nu7/i_cant_focus_do_you_want_to_go_to_a_cafe_and_work/,1727725528.0,"I just started my masters at UofT and most of the work Iâ€™m doing can be done remotely. However, due to a bunch of really sucky things in my life (long distance relationship, anxiety, family deaths, etc.) I canâ€™t really focus. Idk I think i might be depressed or something.

But anyways I really need to do work and I think it could be good to have a buddy to keep each other on track. I also just moved to Toronto so I think it might be nice to check out some different cafes. 

But yea, if anyone is in a similar situation message me and maybe we can start working together.

Thanks for reading! ",submission,27
