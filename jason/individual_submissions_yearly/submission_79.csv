We can stand up against various injustices while still focusing on the current protest, but at the moment this is the biggest ongoing issue globally, and more people are dying there at the moment than any other place in the world, so maybe this conflict deserves more attention for now.

Also the things we’re dealing with here in Canada are trivial in comparison to what’s most people are going through around the globe. There’s a global inflation trend where many people even in the developed world are finding it hard to keep up with housing costs and often times basic necessities as well so it’s not uniquely a Canadian thing. while improvements could be made Canadians were and are still some of the world’s most privileged people, and we should all be grateful we get to live here.",comment,-1

[This is so stupid I'm going to keep it for posterity](https://imgur.com/a/BQ9nE5b)

Like a thousand people are dying per day in Ukraine. 50k dead since the coup and *actual* genocide in Myanmar. Like 4x more people are being forced from their homes in Sudan than the entire population of Gaza.

Why care about other bigger, deadlier, actually unjust, and much more geopolitically significant conflicts? All I see on TikTok is the shitty little war in some shitty little corner of the Mediterranean where we can't have a ceasefire because the ratio of hostages to prisoners freed being offered to the terrorist government isn't quite satisfactory enough to make them want to stop fighting their much stronger enemy!

I fully accept that the only side that seeks genocide is maybe the ones who elected terrorists and cheered (oh and joined in) when said terrorists invaded Israel to rape, murder, and kidnap innocent people with the goal of eradicating Jews. While I agree that Israel has gone overboard in its response, it is not genocide.

Edit: Okay block me all you want, just cause you can't find facts to match your claims. Also when said organizations have a history of bias and lies against Israel + anti-semitism, not the greatest sources to use. Funny how the ICJ which all of you propped up as going to damn Israel, came out and supported Israel. 

Also why do you think anyone cares what you think? See I'm at least involved in university 'politics' and local politics so I actually do get my opinions heard better than someone like you. It's great when you can call up your local MP and they can get problems fixed for you fast or you can reach them easier and explain your perspectives rather than them having to read what their constituents might think online.",comment,0
