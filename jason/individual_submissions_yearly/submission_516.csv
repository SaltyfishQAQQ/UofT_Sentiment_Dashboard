Can't be the only one who dislikes the Voices of Vic guy,gentle-soliloquy,1e78ne6,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1e78ne6/cant_be_the_only_one_who_dislikes_the_voices_of/,1721408347.0,"Am I the only person that finds that Voices of Vic guy incredibly insufferable? I keep seeing his reels for some reason (atp I should really consider blocking) and every time it's the most re-hashed talk points from centrist-right wing influencers. He adds nothing to any broader conversation-- just the same, boring and obvious rage-bait content that was chewed up and spit into his mouth from other ""influencers"" baby bird style. The fact that he brought on that one super weird guy twice shows that there's nothing that he's contributing to our school or any broader social discourse beyond farming divisive comments.

  
Honestly, I'm just disappointed. I think it's so cool when people from our school create platforms for themselves, (i,e olisunvia is a huge example) and I love lurking/supporting my classmates' ventures into content creation. I think it's neat and I admire them. But usually, it's done very obviously with passion and care. This guy may have started this way, I'm not sure, but his podcast has become just brainrot spittle. Also I don't like the way he talks to his guests that he doesn't agree with, it's quite condescending and cringe. 

  
I'm just venting, but I hope I'm not the only one that sees through it. Just annoying. ",submission,43
