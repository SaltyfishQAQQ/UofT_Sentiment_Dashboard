UTSUâ€™s AGM was today and it was beyond disappointing,Upstairs-Drama2888,1g8fwvh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g8fwvh/utsus_agm_was_today_and_it_was_beyond/,1729479090.0,"UTSUâ€™s AGM was today, and two of the execs didnâ€™t even show up. This is despite the fact that they are paid full-time salaries funded by student fees. The president was one of the execs who didnâ€™t show up, and the other VP who didnâ€™t attend didnâ€™t even write a report ðŸ˜­ there was a question about it and the other execs didnâ€™t even know why she wasnâ€™t there. there was another question on how the presidentâ€™s report wasnt substantive even though he was supposed to be working full time since summer. Turns out he had an internship at Wells Fargo the whole time while still making a salary from the UTSU, which is really upsetting because this is all our money. Really disappointing, especially after the health plan mess.",submission,129

They had Elizabeth answering the questions and her answers sucked. Thereâ€™s no actual accountability system theyâ€™ll use and Iâ€™m pretty sure we were below quorum during the second half. Sad that so much of our tuition goes towards these people who donâ€™t prioritize us,comment,45
