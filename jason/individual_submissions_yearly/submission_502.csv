I can't compare to 1st semester of Aerospace Engineering, since I'm still in it, but to date, 2nd year 1st semester was the hardest academic period of my life. That being said:

Pull out of major time commitments for the next 3-4 months. I used to work part-time and was also part of 2 design teams during the semester, and while I made it work, it hurt way more than it needed to. 

Understand that you're going to be having 1-2 midterms every week starting October 2nd all the way to 1 week before finals. You can not afford to fall behind, so never skip lectures to catch up on something else. I've seen many many many people cascade into failing this semester this way. Skipping lecture to solve a problem set or assignment just means you'll have to skip more to catch up on the next one, and it's a vicious cycle.

You absolutely must find a way to organize your deadlines, as you should expect to have around 3 or 4 labs, 1-2 midterms, 2-3 quizzes/PCEs, 1 reading, and 0.5 problem sets due per week (These being just the mandatory ones, any extra practice you do on your own is not included here). This requires a herculean effort in terms of time management, so at the start of every month, just sit down and map all your lab/midterm/problem set/deliverable due dates based on the syllabus.

You should select the labs in a calculated manner. They're usually all doable in 2 hours unless you picked some crazy PHY ones (which you shouldn't, because the upper years would have already instructed you on which ones to choose). 


You're studying Waves right now in PHY. It's actually quite straightforward conceptually, but the Professors explanations may not be the clearest. Don't get too bogged down in the details and just understand how to apply the horrendous formulas and when to use which. You will get to make an annotated formula sheet, so ensure you know which formulas are important. It only gets harder from here with Quantum and S.R, for which the main thing is to be good with Integrals. 

I found Waves very useful both as an Aero, as someone taking RF/Radar courses, and also just for doing Complex Number/PDE math. 

ODEs is one of the more straightforward courses. Understand the concepts very deeply, it's how you score top on the midterm (and to a lesser extent the final). You should have the Lin Alg especially down packed, as that's where a lot of the conceptual understanding comes from. Also pay attention to the Rocket Flight and various real world case studies taught in class, as they'll directly be on the midterm. Try and get the MATLAB labs done in your assigned tutorial block, they shouldn't take you more than 2 hours each if you focus. 

Vector Calculus requires a lot of practice and understanding. Do the assigned practice questions and don't fall behind. Same goes with Fluids, as your main content will be on Hydrostatics (and it's very much not representative of what you'll be doing as an Aero, apart from maybe the last few chapters). However, you will be cooked as soon as next semester's Electromagnetics if you don't properly figure out how to do Vector Calculus, and this will extend for the next 2 years. Especially so if you're in one of the more intense majors like Aerospace Engineering or Electrical Engineering where VC makes up a great deal of what you're doing. If there's only two courses you really try and do well in, make it be ODEs and Vector Calculus (and if you're an Aero, add Thermo/Heat Transfer to that list).

For Thermo/Heat Transfer, it's one of the easier courses if you don't fall behind. Don't fall behind, keep up to the lectures with the textbook. Just solving the examples from the textbook and then doing past exams is entirely sufficient to score in the top percentile in your exams. They follow the same pattern.

Digital Logic and Comp Arch builds on itself significantly. You won't be able to understanding anything in the future lectures if you fall behind or miss a concept from a previous one in my experience. Hence, don't fall behind and ensure youre up to date on concepts. Review things immediately if you're unsure on a lecture's main idea. The key to doing well in this course is just being very strong in Verilog and Assembly. I would say just being good at doing stuff in these languages is more important than even understanding the course concepts, because you'll be able to dump whatever concepts you need on to your cheatsheet, but if you're not familiar with the Verilog nuances, you're going to get griefed on both midterms and the weekly 3 hour labs which can be difficult and time consuming. 

For Ethics, ensure you're legitimately paying attention to what's being discussed in lectures. Oftentimes you'll end up being assigned 5-15 page readings, and it can become unrealistic to keep up with every week when you have 90 other things going on. Read the readings in lecture and understand the main points. In seminar, participate actively and just give honest well thought out viewpoints. It's the effort and engagement that really matters. Make sure you give yourself enough time to do the ANT assignment, but don't spend more than 1 or 2 nights on it, since you'll have a LOT of stuff going down around the time it's due. Give yourself a week to write the research paper. For the midterms, Ctrl + F is your friend if you need to reference a concept from a reading or two for your long answer questions.

If you're in a really difficult spot deadlines wise, reach out to your professors. Your professors in EngSci are very kind and reasonable people, and they care a lot about your experience/empathize with students. If things are getting out of hand and deadlines are piling up, approach them and explain the situation. 

We had a week where there was a Monday where we had 2 problem sets, 2 Labs, a midterm, and a culminating research paper all due on the same day. I spoke to the profs and they were willing to move things around in a very generous and compassionate manner (Our research paper got extended all the way to the start of the exam period, which was like a 2 week extension). 

Try your best. It's hard, and it doesn't always work out. If nothing else works and youre at your wits end, I'd say just pay special attention to the specific courses relevant to your major and do as good as manageable in the rest.

It gets so much better, I promise. Next semester feels like you're on early summer break in comparison.

Sending my best wishes. Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. EngScis are able to power through because we help each other out.",comment,12
