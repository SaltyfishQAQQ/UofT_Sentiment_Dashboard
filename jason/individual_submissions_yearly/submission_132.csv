Lemme clarify and say as a human being i do support Palestinians and I 100% sympathize with the cause. I’m trying to be careful with my wording here because tbh no matter what I say someone’s going to get pissed. Long story short yes I support palestinians..

**MY QUESTION**: lowkey what’s the point of protesting at uoft, why not protest at/nearby the Ontario legislative building literally right across the street…? Uoft is funded by the government, so naturally they’re just going to copy whatever the government is doing. The Canadian government supports Israel therefore naturally so does uoft. 

**SO IF ANYTHING** wouldn’t it be better to protest against the the government instead of the university,  pressure the government into making a humanitarian stance and naturally the university (and then some) will follow along like a domino effect…. 

That being said I just don’t understand why I don’t/rarely see any protests against the Canadian government. I see more people bashing Starbucks even tho Starbucks doesn’t even have a store in Israel…? I hate to see it but it’s like these encampments/boycotts are just a trend with no original/critical thought ……. Literally not a dollar from Starbucks is going to Israel and yet if  u go to Starbucks u will be treated like the spawn of Satan… ",submission,186

During the fight against apartheid in South Africa, a lot of universities had encampments pressuring the university to divest. They were able to get a lot of demands met and biiiiig stuff at the university changed. Uoft changed a major statement  (I forget whether it was their mission statement, statement of aim, etc) to include a commitment to human rights. These types of things really do pressure government to step up and that’s so important.",comment,146

UofT is not transparent with where their investments are (we have no idea what companies they are invested in or where they get donations from) and thus one of the main goals of the protest is to **disclose** all investments UofT may have. If anything, it's a good thing to advocate for transparency of UofT's assets given that they also may have investments in sectors like fossil fuels or weapons manufacturing that students do not want to see their tuition money spent on.   
  
In doing so, the protesters are also demanding that UofT **divest** from any holdings, both direct or indirect, that have a relationship with the ongoing brutalization of the Palestinians. It's a pretty clear ask from the encampment in that regard. Gertler accidentally revealed in a meeting with the organizers (back when they did a sit-in at Simcoe Hall in the Winter) that UofT **has indirect investments into Israeli firms** but he denied to take action to divest from them. 

They're also demanding that the administration **sever ties with Israeli academic institutions** that involve themselves in the conflict. This one is a little more vague, given that it's not very clear what degree of involvement would constitute grounds for cutting of ties. 

I believe that the adoption of the definition of anti-Palestinian racism by the University was/is also one of their demands, but it seems to have been cut from the primary messaging in favour of the above three demands. **Unlike Starbucks, UofT has a role in the conflict and the student encampment is there to reveal the extent of this involvement and to demand a halt to it.**",comment,44

Every single week there is at least one protest, these are at least 2k each week, with most being over 5-8k people, and MULTIPLE being over 20-30k.


These targeted Israeli embassies, US embassy, Canadian parliament, and so on. 

Dozens of thousands have protested at every major city in Canada weekly. 

They ARE protesting government. 

At the same time, we can't just protest the government. UofT is the biggest university in Canada, and one of the best in the world. If UofT divests, it creates real pressure against the Canadian government through 2 things:

1. Its divestment pressures the government to do more. 

2. More Canadian (and other countries) universities will divest, leading to even more pressure. 

Remember, the people who are donating to these universities are HEAVILY Zionist.  Divestment is the last thing they want. When a university as big as uoft divests, it flips the table upside down . It causes a ripple effect, AND it also does mean that our money doesn't go to apartheid through the channel of UofT's investments. 

Think about it. If it's so hard to get UofT to divest, what hope do we have with the actual government, which is a thousand times worse? We need to start with what we can. 

Apartheid South Africa fell through divestment. We need to start the ripple effect.",comment,182

I am Jordanian and speaking from experience we have been boycotting years back in solidarity with Palestine. In my lifetime I have only once stepped foot in a Starbucks, only because it stays open longer than other coffee places on campus and I wasn’t aware of the Theo’s coffee machine yet. The issue is that a group of people that you are able to count on your fingers will not have the same impact of having hundreds, thousands or millions of people boycotting. You may see the boycott as a current trend, however it is not. Thankfully it is becoming a global movement and is now making an actual impact. A number of Starbucks branches have closed down in Jordan so has a number of McDonald’s branches as well. In return we have seen a significant increase in local businesses and economic activity in only seven months.",comment,8

Note the date on that communication!

When, at the beginning of April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied President Gertler’s office and an agreement was made to engage in discussions, the meeting was unproductive and ill-intentioned on behalf of the university. President Gertler showed his inability and incompetence to deal with the situation by repeatedly conflating Arabs and Muslims, misunderstanding the history of the Palestine-Israel conflict, and lying about the lack of support for Palestine on campus. During this meeting, it was confirmed that U of T does have active investments in Israeli apartheid and weapons manufacturing. It was also revealed during this meeting that the university initiated their own meeting with Israeli students to support them, meanwhile it took six months of attempted communication with the President’s office (all of which were ignored) and a sit-in to be heard by Palestinian supporters. After this unproductive meeting, University of Toronto has refused to discuss any demands past the sit-in.

When, at the beginning of April, pro-Palestinian demonstrators occupied President Gertler’s office and an agreement was made to engage in discussions, the meeting was unproductive and ill-intentioned on behalf of the university. President Gertler showed his inability and incompetence to deal with the situation by repeatedly conflating Arabs and Muslims, misunderstanding the history of the Palestine-Israel conflict, and lying about the lack of support for Palestine on campus. During this meeting, it was confirmed that U of T does have active investments in Israeli apartheid and weapons manufacturing. It was also revealed during this meeting that the university initiated their own meeting with Israeli students to support them, meanwhile it took six months of attempted communication with the President’s office (all of which were ignored) and a sit-in to be heard by Palestinian supporters.

Israeli businesses targetted by BDS are actually those who hire Palestinians, providing salaries much higher than those available to them in Gaza, and improve chances of normalization between Palestinians and Israelis. Much like the brutal attack of Oct. 7 (whom more than 90% of Gazans support) murdered many Israelis who had dedicated their lives to an attempt for peace. Beyond that, before Oct 7, there was an increased amount of Palestinians being given work permits to work in Israel - some of those visa holders took part in the atrocities. These protests like to pretend this war is just another element of a long lasting conflict. No. It is a war on a scale that would NEVER have happened if not for the insanely brutal and sadistic attacks of Oct 7.

Edit: those crying about the extreme right gov't in Israel (me among them, I hate them) - one could say they did not rise in a vacuum.

Also if we're just talking about the boycott stuff, this doesn't necessarily just apply to students.

So sure maybe they weren't as informed but like people knew. It was online, it was in the news. Fuck for so long the headlines used to be things like ""IDF shoots innocent doctor in Jerusalem"" as headlines. In reality the 'innocent doctor' stabbed a soldier out of nowhere and got shot. The news used to be heavily anti-Israel. I used to even use this website when I was around 16 and r/Worldnews used to be anti-Israel while r/News was the pro-Israel one. 

  
People like you say stuff like this ""I knew that Israel was bad but I didn't realize how bad it was."" and that is exactly my point. In the past it was disproportionate how badly the news misrepresented things at times and would swell in the popular thought. Israel was painted consistently as worse than they were acting (Now its 50/50, depending on who wrote the article it will probably not be neutral and will be far more pro-one side). The reality is though I think you guys need to realize how bad Palestine is. Too much of this pro-Palestinian narrative is 1 side bad, 1 side innocent victim. Reality is, Palestinians need to do far better and be denazified, the Israeli Jews in turn need to be less racist towards Arabs (Fuck an article just came out saying within Israel, the Arabs tend to be less hateful towards the Israeli Jews than Israeli Jews towards Israeli Arabs, but the Arabs from outside Israel but within the Middle East hate Jews more than Israeli-Jews hate Arabs. Granted this was a recent post Oct-7 study). The reality is, Palestinians are overwhelmingly supporting terrorism and Israel has every right to put an end to it but it doesn't give them free reign to just go and do whatever. 

  
Like also lets not pretend teachers didn't have us in political shit all the time. Kony 2012? WWF? WE Day stuff? Fuck they were getting us into politics when we didn't even understand what right and left wing meant.",comment,-8

I also agree with how much of the arguments can be turned right back around on them. I agree wholeheartedly that this is not a 1 side is innocent and 1 side is bad conflict (as I've stated in my other comments despite being rather pro-Israel) both sides have a lot to work on if they ever actually want peace, and both sides are suffering very real trauma from all the conflict which doesn't diminish the other's.

I'm all for supporting whatever you want but be factual. Tik Tok information has time and time shown to be wrong about this conflict. Remember according to Tik Tok, Israel sent a JDAM into a hospital killing 500 (and the numbers were posted minutes after the attack) which then turned into it being a Palestinian rocket that actually hit a parking lot. Tik Tok also said that Israel was shoving men into mass pits then murdering them, but the reality was they were tied up so that they could be identified and if they weren't suspected of any terrorism, they were released (You can argue its fucked up but it is a necessary action that Americans also took when dealing with terrorists who embed themselves within civilian populations). Tik Tok has also spread the false death numbers that the UN just had to halve... This isn't to say Israel is innocent and can do no wrong but Tik Tok has done far more harm in spreading lies than anything else.
