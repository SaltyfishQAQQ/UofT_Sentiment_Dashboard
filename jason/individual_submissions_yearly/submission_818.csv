Aside from having 9am classes four days a week all year long, you also have an average of three hours of classes and tutorials each day. Your day starts at 9am and goes on until 3/4pm. While a 1-hour gap might be good for a lunch or coffee break, these gaps can feel frustrating. They're not long enough to get much studying done, and they don't give you the mindset of ""I'm done for the day, let's go do this or that.""",comment,3

You are also going to get really hungry on monday winter.

Also are you living in res? or commuting? Large gaps are fine for people living in res but might not be good for people that have to commute, especially if you plan to live further out to save on rent.",comment,1
