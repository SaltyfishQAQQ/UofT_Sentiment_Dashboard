"So, how is your enrollment time calculated? Demystified",Prior-Citron-3616,1dtlwgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dtlwgm/so_how_is_your_enrollment_time_calculated/,1719927039.0,"**ONLY RELEVANT TO FACULTY OF ARTS AND SCIENCE**

Based on threads here and me individually asking other students, here's how your current credit count determines your enrollment time. Note that this is based on data, and it might not always be consistent. Try to figure out the ""why"" in the trends.

Blanks mean I do not have the data. If you have the data, comment here. Remember: for the purposes of enrollment time, `credits you have + credits you're taking = credits for enrollment time`

Based on other posts here and surveying I've conducted by my own, alongside official documentation from UofT, here's how it works:

* If you're a first year, the more ""exclusive"" your enrollment stream the later your time. In other words, CS & Rotman have later times than Math&Phys and Humanities.
* For 2nd-3rd year, the more credits you have, the earlier your time. Courses you're taking in the summer count towards that, even if you did not complete them.
* For 4th year students, the more credits you have, the later your time. Again, courses you're currently taking in the summer count towards that. From data I've collected, here's a mapping of each credit count to your enrollment time:",submission,40
