You have coverage for certain things like free annual checkups, teeth cleaning, and polishing. I believe you are covered for dental care if you have an accident but any cosmetic procedures are not covered.

2. What is FT

FT means full-time student.

3. Any information would be greatly appreciated!!

Most of these are incidental and¬†*ancillary fees.* they are not things you can get out of. You can opt out of the health insurance plan if you already have private health insurance.",comment,64

I am a UofT alumni and I can confirm they have made no progress towards modernization of their billing system in the 23 years since I graduated. I recommend your parents not waste time scrutinizing the ridiculous invoice and pay the fees early (in case they have trouble interpreting the *actual* ""amount due"" or *when* the due date actually is). The consequence for miscalculating the payment or being late on payment is the student is withdrawn from courses...and they say they send emails about this but they don't. If your parents have dental coverage for you they can get that money back from UofT but nothing else.",comment,5

If you're asking if it's worth it, my answer is yes. Considering the country I'm from, where money can't buy quality education, attending one of the best universities in the world is beyond what my parents could have dreamed of. Money isn't my main concern; my challenge will be surviving university with good grades and managing to graduate. I'm truly grateful for this opportunity. In my home country, unlike Canada, job experience isn't valued as highly as where you graduate from. Saying I graduated from the University of Toronto means everything. No one cares if I had ten different good jobs without a degree from a well-known university. I understand that a degree isn't everything and that skills are crucial, but this cultural value is something I can't ignore. I hope this could give you a new perspective.",comment,2
