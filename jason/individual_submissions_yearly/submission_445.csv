The campus is so damn HUGE. 

For those who already spend time on campus, what do you recommend I visit/experience? 

Where do you usually chill/study? And why?",submission,55

Just open your phone and get google maps out and just walk around from one side so Spadina (architecture building side) and sweep through campus all the way to the other side and things will feel less daunting. Also check out Queens park during the fall! Iâ€™ve graduated and Iâ€™m moving away for graduate school and Queens park during the fall was by far my favourite place to just sit around and relax during the day (if you like chilly weather) because of the vibes and the squirrels! Thinking about it now makes me wish I accepted my UofT offer to come back but oh well haha",comment,23

if you want to explore, i recommend going to all the libraries uoft has to offer! my favourites are the emmanuel college one, the 12th floor of robarts (up in the stacks where it's quiet) and anywhere in victoria college. the little courtyard/pedestrian area around victoria college is also a lovely place to sit for some peace and quiet! :)",comment,12

Usually much less busy than Robarts, Gerstein, etc and both are very nice inside. There are probably other small libraries and study spots that I havenâ€™t even heard of/been to!",comment,6

I am going to write from my own experience as well. I will not suggest you to excessively rely on Google Maps. Try not to use it frequently, and explore places on your own, rather make your own mind maps. Use GMaps in case you get stuck somewhere, although most of the places mentioned above are themselves prominent landmarks. A good way to explore the downtown campus is on foot, or on a bike. A beautiful and quiet place that has not been mentioned is an open courtyard at the back of Bahen Centre, and a small alleyway that leads you to Anthropology Building. From there, you can walk to the EEB and School of the Environment building and see the rustic cobblestone pathway and exit on the Willcocks street. A short and slow walk. 
Another beautiful place is the green lawn of Sir Daniel Wilson Residence. Spend time there and marvel at the amazing Oak trees there. You will be touching history. Keep walking North and North East and you will exit on Hoskin Avenue. An interesting road, just one block west it's called the Harbord Street. If you move further east on Hoskin Avenue, you have two incredibly beautiful walkways to take. One is Philosopher's walk. I can spend a lot of time there, especially on a sunny day, as I look at the green sprawls around me. You won't believe that when you will exit this walk on the North, you are standing near to ROM and the affluent neighborhood of Yorkville. The second path keeps going east and you can also checkout HartHouse on the way and it's hallowed hallways. You can walk straight into Queens Park from here, and as someone said, spend the whole day there. I do sky gazing during summer as cloud roll by in the day time and the tall trees of Oak and Maple just lures you in in their calming shade. I sometimes doze off and wake up relaxed. You can keep walking east and slightly north to exit towards Victoria College, walk near EJPratt Library (which you should definitely visit more often) and as you enter the green courtyard infront of it, look at that immense, romantic, handsome Oak tree, which has a park bench underneath it. I always imagine a hundred love stories formulating under its lovely shade, I can sit there and write a small fiction. Slowly you walk ahead and north to exit on Charles Street and again find yourself in the flourishing Bloor-Yonge area. 
These places and names will become a part of your lingo at the University in sometime, although these places adorn different Colors and moods in different seasons. Don't miss any, I would say ;) 

I think I missed the cherry blossom area near the Robarts library, which attract tourists from world over. 

Another suggestion - use directions when navigating yourself- for eg. this place is west of this place, north of this place - like this. It's intuitive and easy, atleast for me. 

And I wish you a happy exploration of the UniversityðŸ˜Š",comment,4
