Is $140k worth it for University of Toronto? (international student),saarfsi,1cbzrcv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cbzrcv/is_140k_worth_it_for_university_of_toronto/,1713969234.0,"

UPDATE: I looked into the fees and realised the fees increase each year RIP. I don't think I can afford 160k... 

Hello, I'm an international student from South Asia who has been accepted into U of T with almost 55k CAD scholarship for first year and 45k CAD for the remaining years. Now, the COA for my 5 year double degree with Co-op would probably cost around 140k CAD, of which my parents can barely afford 85k and I can amount to around 30k from Co-op (might have to go to debt).

I also got into a few US colleges like UTA, Sweet Briar, Drexel with a COA around/less than 20k (with Drexel being around 40k but I'm trying to appeal for more aid). I have also been waitlisted from Franklin&Marshall and Denison, and rejected from 20 LACs (wild, I know). I realise none of these colleges are ""glamorous"" when compared to U of T but I'm really trying to determine which will have the greatest ROI in terms of career opportunities, and also PR in Canada.  
Could anyone please let me know how job opportunities are for a U of T intl. undergraduate student right out of university?

My major is Economics for American colleges and BBA (Management & Finance) and BSc Statistics (Quantatitive Finance) for U of T.  
I am really worried as May 1 looms upon all of us and I'll have to commit.",submission,37

Question, do you need the double degree? As in, if you just dropped to getting a management & finance bachelors or the BS in stats would that lower the cost? I feel like there’s a bit too much overlap in your dual degree program and if you can cut it down to one program while lowering the cost that would be super helpful. 

UofT is a very challenging school. Especially the exams they are no joke. But if you can come out with a 3.0+ GPA that’ll look amazing on a resume. 

When it comes to PR it’s not so cut and dry. Now immigration law/rules can change and I suspect they will change as Canada is clamping down on immigration. But essentially for intl students, when you graduate you’ll be granted a PGWP (you need to follow rules to get the permit such as maintaining full time status) which will allow you to work unrestricted for a couple of years. Then you need to get skilled employment to get enough points to qualify for PR through express entry. Please connect with the intl student office for a more in depth break down. All this to say PR is a non guaranteed privilege for intl students not a given right. Best of luck!",comment,12

The most prestigious on that list is probably franklin&marshall.  If it costs that much more than the other colleges i dont think its worth it.  As an international student it's more important to figure out where you want to stay if your intention is to immigrate.

If this is now or soon, then maybe, depends if you have a high earning role after graduating.

Entry level roles are extremely competitive in Canada and for significantly lower pay than in the USA. With what you earn you’ll barely be able to afford rent and a decent quality of living, nevermind purchasing a property.

Mind you many people graduate from business school in Toronto, therefore a lot of finance jobs in Toronto pay a lot less than let’s say software engineers. If you truly want to stay in quant finance, I’d add something software related as a minor. If you really want to stay in Canada, software related finance jobs is better pay and work life balance too.

Another plausible route is, excel in studying at UFT and somehow getting a job in the USA and living in the USA. So if you are able to graduate and reside in the USA, then I would do that. USA market is just so big and offers so much opportunity.",comment,4

Job market is crazy and it is very difficult to get a job regardless of the uoft branding. I recommend going to cheaper universities like TMU if you plan to immigrate and then when you get your PR maybe do graduate studies at uoft.. that way you can study at uoft aswell .. if immigration is not in your books then US is better option.

Whats wisdom to you?  Wear your regrets; you're damned if you, and you're damned if you don't.  Can't go back to change something to predict a more satisfying tomorrow. That's resentment.   

The 140k debt is what it is; its never gonna be worth it to someone - that's kinda what you're trying to get at im assuming?:

You don't gotta live that $140k.  Of course, you're gonna want to validate the investment - that goes without saying. We're all in some sort of dick measuring contest(s).  Yes, you better get a solid return on investment - you gotta be honest with yourself though only.  If you're the one walking with a limp - yea its worth it. Whether you decide to go to U of T or not.

No matter the path you take, whether it passes through an academia route or not.  Life is hard; money is a qualifier to even play the game of life. Can it buy happiness - fuk yes. However, trust me you're worth it to play.

Most loans will start racking up interest after you graduate, and you most likely won’t be paid that much money when you first graduate Bachelors, so it’s a harder struggle to pay when you’re fresh out of Bachelors. If you’re looking into Masters eventually, I’d suggest rethinking “expensive and prestigious universities“ later on when you get there (hopefully with more experience so it’s easier to get a good paying job after Masters).

I would suggest doing your own research though and checking out some of the subreddits people have mentioned (r/Torontojobs paints a pretty grim picture) to decide for yourself.

Personally, if your goal is immigration, I would not attend a mid tier university in the US. The pathway to get a green card is incredibly challenging compared to Canada’s immigration system. Plus, with an election on the horizon it could get even worse. Again connect with the intl student office at those uni’s to learn about the H1B process and STEM OPT.

I’d lean toward a Management/Finance degree as Stats is more theoretical and imo trains people more to go into grad school than industry. But then again uni is what you make of it.

I see student budgets frequently in my work and 18-20k is tight unless you are very diligent about not spending money. Plus you may live off campus in future years because res spots can be hard to come by for upper years and then you are paying for summer rent, possibly utilities, etc. FYI - My experience is primarily with the downtown campus.",comment,2

The whole point of liberal arts colleges is to provide an intimate and rigorous education to its undergrads, so everything about the school is designed to facilitate that. This means hiring professors who are actually good at teaching, helping them teach better, making teaching a critical factor in tenure reviews, making sure classes are small enough for students to get individualised mentorship, creating a campus environment primarily centered around undergrads, etc. Of course many of these things can only happen in a well-funded school, that's why LACs are primarily private, receive a lot of endowment relative to its size, and charge a high tuition rate. 

For big, research universities (UofT, McGill, state flagships, etc), their focus is research. That's how they get money and that's how governments (which fund them) want the money to be spent. Therefore, neither the school nor the faculty really cares about undergrads. Schools are under the pressure to improve their ranking, and faculty members are under the pressure to do research and publish. This is not problematic itself, obviously. The problem is simply that publishing and doing cutting-edge research mean little as far as undergrads are concerned. In fact, the money and resources that could be used to make classes smaller and hire more competent professors are now shifted for the sake of research output.",comment,2
