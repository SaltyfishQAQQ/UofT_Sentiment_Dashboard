Most people going to orientation have nothing better to do.

If you’re Canadian and plan on staying here, you’ll be much better suited investing your time money and energy into learning French as opposed to attending these events or going to clubs. These young adult years are years that determine who you’ll be for the rest of your life. Don’t waste them.",comment,-9
