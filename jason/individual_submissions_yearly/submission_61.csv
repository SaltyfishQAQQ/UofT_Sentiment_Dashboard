ACORN is the worst it has ever been this year and the university needs to fix it ,ihatedougford,1dzzyrx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dzzyrx/acorn_is_the_worst_it_has_ever_been_this_year_and/,1720628591.0,"I just had my course enrolment this morning and oh my days that was the worst experience Iâ€™ve ever had trying to do something at UofT. Constant crashes, website freezing when I press enrol on a course, buggy lag, and my course enrolment cart didnâ€™t appear for 2 minutes. That is a disgrace. Absolutely disgusting behaviour from a top 30 university in the world with state of the art technology. 

Iâ€™ve seen others on this Reddit with the same concerns. How are 1st years going to deal with this? What about the influx of 2nd years too? Itâ€™s ridiculous how you can not get into a course you have priority for because of a horrendous portal that never had these issues in my other years as a university student here. 

Meric Gertler spent too much time on the injunction to fix his website. Genuinely bro what the heck was that experience and donâ€™t get me started on the fact everyone has different times to start. What a joke.

University of Toronto, fix your website.
