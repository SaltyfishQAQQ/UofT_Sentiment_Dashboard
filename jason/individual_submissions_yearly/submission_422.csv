Here are some examples:

Most of the art posted was done through burner accounts, so I want to ask where did everyone go?

Way back then I drew short comics of those characters; this is my most popular one (https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/pj8277/yorku\_strikes\_back\_at\_u\_of\_t/)

I still draw, I've drawn illustrations and comics for The Varsity in the past two years (I've slipped the U of T animification into this [drawing ](https://thevarsity.ca/2022/09/11/lo-fi-and-new-age-music-as-a-balm-for-the-brain/)as an easter egg as a figure). I've been working on manga that's a for fun side project with UTSAMA (U of T's anime club) mascots. It's called U-Chan Struggles in School and is on Tapas.

You can see some of my fanarts if you scroll through, but yeah, it's pretty nice people still remember that whole era of posts lol",comment,34

All of the UofT-related art is posted on this account, which means that unfortunately, I haven’t drawn any since.

I’m active in a few fandoms, but I prefer to maintain relatively separate burner accounts. My art skills have improved considerably these past few years. I’ve had the opportunity to make and sell my own merch (keychains, pins, etc.) and contribute to a few zines. Maybe I’ll even get to booth at a con someday >:)

Life-wise, only a few things have changed since that era. I got a screen tablet (yay!). I’ve chosen to leave CS in favour of pursuing academic philosophy (one must imagine u/notredherring happy!). But before that, I took CSC404 and snagged some awards at the game dev student showcase (cool but useless!). I’m also in the UofT fanfiction club (shameless plug!).",comment,11

If you want to see what I'm talking about, search up `uoft x waterloo` on either the r/UofT or the r/uwaterloo subreddits.",comment,3
