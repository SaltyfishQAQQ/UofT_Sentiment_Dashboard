If yes, contact unit asap. They will help you (will have to, it‚Äôs their requirement) and especially if you can provide documentation to prove you have been trying. Worst alternative is, if this is a Specialist requirement, you may need to switch it to a major, but the unit should help you plan that too in case you only had this one POSt.

Edit: and if this is for HMB- be persistent in your expectation  that unit will help. Of course be polite but if you‚Äôve been trying on your own, they SHOULD HELP especially as it‚Äôs THEIR requirement (think in lines of Dean‚Äôs Promise, but also check Calendar in case there‚Äôs deadlines for by when you have to ask for help etc)",comment,49

It usually helps if you have volunteered with them or were recently in their course/ went to office hours to discuss research. 

Ideally you have good questions and detailed areas that you want to pursue as opposed to a general idea of wanting to do research. It's good you contact so many but make sure that you are really knowing theor research otherwise you risk coming off as just somebody who just wants experience but does not care about their work. 

Are you doing this because you want to do grad school? If so then this is good praactice to find an advisor. It's not easy and it's a big committment for the profs too so you have to show you are serious and there is a trajectory other than to simply get experience.",comment,12

I don‚Äôt need it to graduate but I do need the experience, I‚Äôve had 3 interviews and previous research experience. Meanwhile, so many people have gotten supervisors for last year‚Äôs research courses and they‚Äôre not mainly teaching professors of courses those students have already taken so I‚Äôm confused what I‚Äôm doing wrong",comment,6

I just finished my 4th year in neuroscience specialist, and did HMB496Y1 this past year,¬† it was required to graduate. The admin last summer at HMB told me if I could not find a placement they would give me an equivalent course to graduate as a replacement for HMB496.¬† Although the course was required to graduate the onus to find a placement was completely up to me. What the office did do was provide a list of supervisors that were willing to take on students. No one is gonna give you a placement because you can't find one lol ¬†To answer OPs question though¬† my advice is be persistent and curate each email to that particular supervisor, keep it short, and actually email ones that you are interested in. check out hospitals as well with professors affiliated with UofT, aor. of then could use the help and are eager to take on students, the list provided by admin often get inundated with applicants. read briefly some of their most recent papers to help you with that. For example I ended up working in a genetics lab at CAMH involved in schizophrenia. I had taken a behavioral (PSY390) genetics course in 3rd year and I used that in my opening email how my previous experience in that course resonated with me and how it could connect with the work my supervisor was doing. Obviously give them your transcripts etc right off the bat in the first email if your grades are good",comment,2
