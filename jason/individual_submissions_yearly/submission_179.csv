Taking 6 courses while also having to do a workstudy is insane. I am trying so hard to balance everything and I feel so tired by the end of everyday. 

How do people who stay super busy during the academic year do it? I wanna be a GO GETTER and not be DEPRESSED and TIRED. 

  
Any advice is appreciated. ",submission,154

I am literally so freaking burnt out already and it's just week 5?,cea91197253,lpwn6mc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fu37ts/i_am_literally_so_freaking_burnt_out_already_and/lpwn6mc/,1727831345.0,"As a rule of thumb, a typical course is expected to average to roughly 8hrs of work per week (40hrs for ""full time"" divided by 5 courses; the ""Carnegie standard"" for university work is technically a bit higher, recommending 2 hours out of class for every hour in class, or 9h per course per week for 45hrs). Realistically most of this gets lumped around major assignments and midterms for most students, rather than smoothed out over the term.

So taking an overload of six courses is already about 50hrs a week on average, and more during midterms. If you added a workstudy on top of that course overload, it's unsurprising that you're feeling burned out. That's a lot to commit to even for a go-getter.

The most basic advice is to let something go before your mental health does. If you don't feel like that's possible, as your other comments suggest, you might consider meeting with a learning strategist on campus to discuss optimizing your study habits: [https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/learning-strategist-appointments/](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/learning-strategist-appointments/)",comment,18
I am literally so freaking burnt out already and it's just week 5?,herueru,lpwnlgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fu37ts/i_am_literally_so_freaking_burnt_out_already_and/lpwnlgl/,1727831502.0,"hi!! currently in a similar situation rn but hopefully we can do this!!

1. please eat normal, healthy meals and sleep over 6 hours a day :))

2. try your best to study before your work hours. i think information unfortunately absorbs better before we go through 5h worth of lecture and 10h worth of work, which unfortunately means waking up to study earlier, rather than pushing back late.

3. please try to rest in a way that allows you to be distracted from work, whether it is hanging out with friends or going to the gym, or playing video games. you unfortunately aren't productive when your mind is constantly focused on what you have to do, even when you're not doing the work in question. i like to run on the treadmill!

4. please ask your friends for help, whether it is notes on a previous lecture, or general tips on a worksheet/assignment. visit the tutoring centre if you can - a lot of the time, you can get that tip you needed a lot faster, rather than spending hours looking for it on youtube or in a textbook, just through communicating with people also learning the same thing (or people teaching the thing in question!)

5. focus on the midterms, worth 40% of your grade, rather than the weekly assignment worth 1%. if completing the assignment means forgoing 3-4 hours you can spend studying for the midterm instead, it is better to score poorly on one assignment than one midterm.

6. this is very very old and basic advice, but sometimes you just need to force your thoughts to be positive. i really like talking to my friends in the same major, because a lot of the time they remind me what i find beautiful about the disciplines in the first place. why did you decide to pursue physics and math? was it because you wanted to learn more about the world? always keep it in mind and close to your heart! 

7. talk to professors!!! they can likely help you, understand your concerns (and push that deadline), and potentially give you inspiration and motivation to persevere in your courses further all at once. i also find that once profs can put my name to my face i feel a lot more pressure to do well in the course, as i don't want to disappoint them by slacking off LOL

8. try and do at least one thing you look forward to, at least once a day. even if you can afford to read 5 pages of a book, play games for 30 minutes or watch 1/2 of a movie, that new experience will make your day much better as youve 1. achieved a positive goal, 2. gave yourself a treat, 3. have a good memory associated with that day, so that it doesn't fall into monotony 

i hope these help at least a little bit !!",comment,16

Advice is: don‚Äôt waste a single time between classes. Those small participation mark works even do it in the 10 minutes before class starts. 

If you feel like procrastinating , procrastinate while doing work from another course. 

Study in 45 min/10 min break sessions. I usually do breathing exercises during those 10 minutes so I legit don‚Äôt have a mental break down (LOL)

I like to get most of my work done at school so when I go home I rest well and always get 7-9 hours of sleep.

Food is so so important. Eat healthy!!! If u have time to cook packing is better Becuz it also saves you time instead of going to Tim‚Äôs or some. If you have to buy go for healthier alternatives (lots of veggies and fruits as snacks)

As others are sharing in the comments, look after your mental health. I'm unsure if your schedule allows for a mental break. Assuming you have no time available for social gatherings I would recommend seeing if you can try getting into a study group for some of your classes. Socialize with your classmates, talk shit about your TAs, split work assignments with each other for courses that don't worry about shared answers, looking at you maths.
