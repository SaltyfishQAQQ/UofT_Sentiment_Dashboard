I am not doing too bad in the course prior to the final, got a 73 in the midterm, full participation marks, and okay grades in the first two parts of the project (i lead my team btw), and got absolutely destroyed like an ant in this final.",comment,6

This final I literally just left the first and last question empty. On all the past exams I went over, I've never seen anything like those before. They are like trying to make everything different from past exams. I reviewed for hii and ri but the result is we had that DFBETA, which I never saw it appeared on previous exams. I don't know what other people is doing, but I think if there is no curve I'm gonna get cooked on this one.",comment,4

However the questions were worded confusing. That's why me (and many others around me) found it to be very hard.,comment,1

I hope to see an overall grade curve as well. This exam is just so terrible. From what I heard, last year the midterm was hard while the final was easy. But this year literally every single thing in STA302 is VERY hard. 

I had high expectations and goal in this exam before going in, but since the exam was THAT difficult, my goal would be shattered into a million pieces.",comment,4

Some others are also confusing in my opinion as well, as some questions give so limited information that I don't know where to start or where to end, and had to change my answers multiple times.

Not all questions are confusing, only the ones with confusing wordings and/or limited information. Some questions are quite straightforward, but I might have made several easy-to-make errors unfortunately.",comment,1
