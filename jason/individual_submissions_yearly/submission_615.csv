First week in and I already wanna switch universities,PresentationNo4528,1fb7ydh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fb7ydh/first_week_in_and_i_already_wanna_switch/,1725718677.0,"My question is as the title states. I got into this university (TMU) that I was so sure I was going to and I was basically a hundred percent committed going to. However a few months after, I got into this other top university in Canada( UofT) which I knew from the start was a hard school to get into and also the way they work things around are purposely made complicated to enforce a stronger learning opportunity for students. When I found out I got into this top uni, I wasn’t even sure abt going to the uni I was so committed to. I told myself that most of my friends and people I love are going to TMU, however, I got into a top university which made me feel more obligated to go there because I was able to get into such a hard university. I chose that university and now I wanna transfer to the same initial school I wanted to go to. 

The reason why I wanted to switch universities is because of how much it has affected my mental health only in the span of less than a week. Not even in the first day of going to this top university in canada, I already felt extremely overwhelmed and anxious and you cannot imagine how worse it got when lectures actually started. I absolutely feel like I am not smart enough for this university as everyone around me seem to know what theyre doing. I also do not like the way I am being taught in my one hour lectures and 2hrs for this other course, because the way the teach me is as if I already know it and they expect me to learn everything by myself which is something I suck in because I learn best when everything is taught. I tell myself to give it some time perhaps I am overreacting, but I feel like the longer I stay, the worse my mental health is gonna get and that I am afraid it is getting later and later until it is too late.

And now I’m considering and I am convinced that I really wanna transfer out of this school. However I have a multitude of worries now in terms of my financial aid (OSAP) and how I am gonna apply for the sane program I got into at TMU.

My first and biggest worry is if I were to leave as early as now (which I hope I do) is, would the osap grants and loans given to me all turn into a debt or will I be able to get a refund from UofT and use that same money from osap as my funding for when transfer schools.

If I wanna leave now, will I have to drop out of this school hence turning my osap funding into a debt? Because I plan to just reapply to TMU but start in the winter term which I do not mind. But i dont know how the osap funding works If I were to switch universities.

Uoft has also taken abt 8k+ from the osap funding they gave me and I dont know how to get a refund back for osap or if that is even possible. Will I be in debt of the amount spent on uoft? Or everything osap gave me FOR uoft. 

I an reallt hoping there is a way I can get a refund for the amount osap spent an still be able to use this same funding fir a different school and term.

I tell myself to give it sometime however if I keep staying I feel like my mental health is gonna get worst and that the later I stay is the more too late it is for me to transfer out of this school onto the one I’d rather go into.

I am a first gen daughter and the pressure really is on me, the way I am the first person in my family to even go to a big university like UofT.

Please help me out and tell me the steps to take.",submission,33

University IS overwhelming and for most people it takes a lot longer than one week to adjust. This isn’t high school, so professors have much different expectations of you than your teachers would have. Everyone is coming from different backgrounds so they don’t know what you’ve learned and they can’t tell what you don’t understand in a lecture filled with hundreds of people. If the people around you look like what they’re doing, spoiler alert: they don’t. Some people are just better at hiding it than others. 

Also, it can be hard to go to a different school than the people who have surrounded you your whole life. However, I believe that it is one of the best decisions you could have made as it will allow you to grow in leaps and bounds, compared to if you were to stay in your comfort zone. That being said, you are lucky that uoft is close to tmu, so visit your old friends whenever you’d like. Don’t forget though, that everyone in university is looking to make friends. Talk to people. Most of the time they will be happy to chat with you. Small talk may be awkward, but that is how you hit it off with people and create lasting friendships. 

Overall, I’d recommend you take a minute to step back from all the new things that are happening around you, and notice that you are not alone in your journey or your feelings. Give it a semester, you’re here now because you deserve to be here, so make this most of it. If you don’t like it even then, you can look into transferring, there’s no shame in that. It would be a great idea to talk to someone at the university for the rest of your questions, they might even be able to connect you with someone to help you process everything that is overwhelming right now. 

Good luck!",comment,38

So don't worry, you aren't alone on that.
* Make good use of your profs'/TAs' office hours. You say they teach like they expect you know everything. Well, try noting down what you don't understand and go ask them. If you can't/don't wanna go to their office hours, you can also do this after class / over email. I'm sure most profs/TAs would be more than willing to help you out.",comment,25

In that option, you aren't a transfer student. The next admission cycle would be for January or September depending on the program. January admissions open on OUAC very soon, September admissions typically in October. 

 Your second option is to apply to TMU as a transfer student for the next admission cycle and continue as a student at UofT in the meantime. After you accept a TMU offer, you would apply for transfer credit for completed UofT courses. You might find in the meantime that you've adapted to UofT.",comment,11

I would suggest talking to your registrar or college to seek advice on the process and going through options. 

University is a big jump from high school and many students aren’t prepared to be left on their own but I don’t think this is any different whether you go to TMU or UofT. It seems like you’re looking for a support system and being with your friends does that for you. Do what’s right for you. Have you been studying? Are you able to understand the material on your own? Id make a decision quick because you don’t want to waste your time or money. If you think you can do well by putting in effort, you can stick it out. But if the pressure is too much or the pace is too fast, you might want to consider dropping soon and reapplying to TMU for January. 

Here’s the refund schedule: [https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/dates-deadlines/academic-dates#academic-dates-deadlines-accordion-4](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/current/dates-deadlines/academic-dates#academic-dates-deadlines-accordion-4) Again re-confirm this with your registrar/ college.

First week in and I already wanna switch universities,ktissan,lm0dwqj,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fb7ydh/first_week_in_and_i_already_wanna_switch/lm0dwqj/,1725741882.0,"First of all, the university you go to does not make you special. It is you! I go to UofT and I got into many internships including Microsoft and I will tell you that in all my internships, I always met TMU students more than UofT students. So in the end of day, having UofT degree is not that special compared to a TMU degree. 

Now is TMU easier than UofT? Maybe but also I think some people find it hard to go to UofT because how competitive it is (POST, etc). But university in general is harder than what you are used to and probably people like you are in TMU who regret going there.

High school is easier compared to university and everyone can agree with that so don’t get discouraged and don’t feel like you can’t achieve the marks you expect. University is all about progress, leveling up skills and this includes the way you learn things, manage time. The good thing is that you will learn a lot about yourself. As soon as you get into job market, no one is going to be holding your hand to get work done. 

So try to see what you need to improve to make your university experience better. Maybe a new study strategy, a group to study with, etc. Also don’t follow what other people are doing cause it may not work for you, so from now try different things and if you see you getting the result then stick with it. If it doesn’t, then try something else. If you don’t see the progress and you 100% that UofT is allowing you to progress, you can transfer to TMU after this year but if you don’t recognize what you need to work on, you will probably experience the same thing at TMU. 

Remember you are not the only one. For some people it takes for years to adapt like myself. But don’t blame the university cause that will prevent you from improving.

If you need help with a course there are a lot of resources and you can maybe ask profs and TAs about where you can get these resources such as textbooks, videos etc. Or get help externally such as asking help from someone who has taken the course.",comment,3

First year university is always hard and you usually have no idea what’s going on. Id say take a couple hours just scrolling through your courses’ syllabi, make a calendar or list of all due dates, test dates, and what not, and start making little steps to accomplish what you need to do. That way you don’t feel overwhelmed.
Theres no need to switch, drop out, or do anything drastic just yet. It sounds like you’re adamant on getting out but I’ll say that mindset tends to make things worse.",comment,4

I recently re-enrolled at UofT after a long absence, and had to have my visit with my Registrar, so I am a little aware of the process.  
\*So by the way, I also dropped out of Engineering, and was at UofT for years so I do get it.  It's best to do it Week 1 and get on with your life.  I myself did not realize until much after Week 1.  
  
So, I've been reading a little about deadlines, and from what I expect, yes, you missed a deadline, but you can still drop courses.  What that means is that because you registered already and are de-registering during the school year, they'll refund your money for your courses but they'll charge you for registering and de-registering.  In Arts and Science the fee is I think $350.

I don't know exactly how Engineering does it, but your best bet is to get to the Engineering Registrar Monday morning and sit down with them.  Sleep on it, make sure you feel good with your decision.  And go there and de-register.  It should be pretty simple.  I went to my Registrar in Arts and Science to re-register after a long absence and they made it fairly easy to do it.

So that's what you do.  And yeah, I totally agree with your decision.  You've got to go with what feels right.  If you're getting that instinct that this just isn't working out, then maybe that is the truth.  I ignored that feeling myself and tried to stick it out.  Wasted my time and energy and yeah, mental health and youth.

I think you may have an out because you are making this decision in Week 1.  You can even make your way to Ryerson (it's like a 30 minute walk from College and St George to Gerrard and Yonge) and ask them what your options are.  Explain the situation, that you're currently not a student and that you've received your offer of admission from them.  You can even bring your offer if that may help.  Try it out, who knows, it may work out for you.

But yeah, I hope things work! :)  We all make mistakes, the best thing we can do is spot the mistake quickly and address the situation.  Instead of panic and make more mistakes.  I hope this finds you well, and your schooling search gets solved :)",comment,2

I understand that it’s a struggle, but honestly the only thing we can really do I our best right? If that’s not gonna be enough than maybe it wasn’t for us in the first place. I say that you should try to stick it out for at least a couple of weeks before considering that transfer. Who knows maybe you will find your element, if not than you can transfer.

I had so many acquaintances and a few friends going to UBC, even my parents and university counsellors suggested I pick UBC because of social circles and better grades. I picked UofT because of the prestige and because I did not want to associate myself with people from my high school. I started questioning my decision big time in my first semester seeing how well my friends at UBC were doing. Now, after graduating, I don’t regret staying here even a bit because I found such incredible friends and also met very supportive profs (can also depend on your department). 
ONLY THING: don’t let your first week determine what UofT might offer you. First week is generally the worst, everyone is a snob, people cannot get enough of their planners, and this definitely is intimidating for some people considering how pretentious some students might come off as. This is okay, and it’s very normal but don’t let this discourage you from giving UofT a solid chance because it deserves this.

UofT is crazy hard.  Maybe you could do it.  But I wouldn't gamble my OSAP on hoping that maybe you could graduate.  This is a bad idea.  They should be a little more open about telling students the reality of university, especially a top-20 University in the world, which UofT is.  These schools are no joke.  You really have to make the grade.

It is definitely not the end of the world if you don't go to UofT.  There are other universities. UofT is the only one that places in the top-20 worldwide.  The other ones are more ""normal"", nothing about UofT is considered normal.

I know people, smart people who had to leave UofT.  It is a more common occurrence than you think coming in from High School.  Think of UofT like Harvard or Yale or MIT or one of those Ivy League universities.  Would you apply to Georgia Tech or Cal Tech or one of the top American Tech Schools?

I would guess probably you would not.  That's what UofT is.  Except it has a reputation for also being highly cold and individualistic.  It is for a certain type of person, and it is one of the top schools.

You probably wouldn't complain or feel bad about not going to MIT, or Cal Tech or one of those schools.  So don't feel bad about not doing Engineering at UofT.

Anyways.  Those are my thoughts.  I have to go get my Psych Textbook in the next hour and start my year.

Take this as a learning experience.  If you have to pay off $329 well you'll need to get a job and save money however you can.  You can do it.  However much time it takes to pay that off.

What you don't want to do is follow up one mistake with another and another.  You see the Stop sign, and you stop.  You figure out why it happened and then you actually fix the situation.

I am going to guess that you are, as a 17/18 year old, probably not ready for university.  Definitely not UofT.  Many people make this mistake.  Not everyone is ready to go, and you risk doing further mental health damage by continuing just because you're scared of not being in school.

I had classmates, international students, that took a year off to work.  It is common in other countries to do this.

It's okay.  Go back next year.  You need a year to grow up and mature.  At 19 years old, you will feel better and stronger and able to make better decisions.  It's a big difference between 18 and 19.

It's not a big deal.  The other option is worse.  I can't even tell you the amount of people at UofT that wind up in mental health problems and fail out.  I don't want to scare you, it is a LOT.  It is way, way better to just quit while you're only $300 bucks and a minor mental meltdown behind.

Take a year, figure it out.  But more importantly.  You're not ready.  Don't force it.

You’ll prob get used to it very soon. UofT eng gives you good advantage when applying for jobs. I’d try it out before trying to switch, you may regret transferring and not pushing yourself at UofT.",comment,6

After high school, college was the only place where I was given step by step instructions on how to do anything. In university part of the challenge was figuring things out on my own with some guidance from profs and TAs, which is a far more useful skill to learn. 

what will help OP if they’re struggling in class is doing the readings before the lecture, this way more of the lecture will make sense",comment,3

Being overwhelmed is a very common feeling and it may pass after another week or so. Uni is super different from high school and the adjustment is hard in everyone.

With that being said, there’s no shame in switching and trying a different school. TMU is a great school and I’m sure you’ll do great if you decide to switch.",comment,5

It may seem too fast but ultimately you are learning to learn here. When you get better at problem solving, you will find it so useful in your future career when you are asked to do something that doesn't have steps! One of the biggest thing I learned in school (and it took many years) was the amazing feeling of ""I don't know how to do what's asked of me but I'm going to find out."". 

In my first year, chemistry sounds like what you're describing, people seemed to already know everything. What got me through was working with other people.

Right now too be honest it sounds like the fear of not being able to do things is stopping you more than your actual abilities. That sounds like a bad thing but it's not. It means that you have abilities you can unleash once you let yourself take the risks to really try something you don't already know. 

You could be honest with your TA and say 'I'm used to being taught step by step, do you have advice for learning how to solve problems without being given the steps?""",comment,1

And I refuse ti stay longer because I am afraid it might be too late ti switch out of this school and that I also need to spend more money on textbooks and a specific calculator and theres so much more.,comment,1
