This is for a humanities, heavily writing focused 300 level class. I understand that this TA has a lot on their plate, getting their PHD and having a family but I feel like after paying so much for this course, it's not unreasonable to want actual feedback I can use for my academic career and not some AI slop. 

I don't even know what to do, whether I'm overreacting or what steps to take but I was just in shock finding out. This paper was worth 50% of my grade, and if I had submitted AI for it I would be in the department head's office right now. ",submission,192

However, if your TA was sloppy enough, it is pretty easy to notice AI generated text if you've read enough of it. I'm guessing you have a hunch it's AI generated because you ran it through the detection software. Unfortunately, you can't prove it, so you're only recourse would be to ask the TA to explain his feedback to you and go through the paper with you. If they wrote the feedback themselves, they'll easily be able to pinpoint why they gave you certain feedback.   
  
Don't go into this meeting assuming your TA is guilty, make that judgement after the meeting (even then you can't be sure tbh). If they refuse, then maybe take it up with the prof.",comment,65

While I have heard‚Ä¶whispers of some people using AI generated statements to give feedback, it‚Äôs actually was more annoying to do that way than to just have some pre written statements that we copy and paste, which, because they are often vague and non specific, sound a lot like ai. Nobody I know would take the time to write a GPT prompt and copy and paste each paper into there to get pre written feedback. 

Was the only feedback you got the assignment comment? No in-text grading or rubric comments? If so, I can get why you‚Äôd be annoyed. As others have pointed out, we get like 15 minutes at the most per paper, so it is hard to be super personal. 

Here‚Äôs the good news: the papers I grade that get little to no feedback beyond an assignment comment are the ones that I think are excellent, or at least very well done. The ones that get no feedback are the ones I don‚Äôt have to worry about. It‚Äôs when a paper is far below standards that I add lots of feedback. You also are far more likely to get a student asking for grade clarification when you give them a bad mark over a good one, so you add more feedback in order to support your critique. 

It is the winter break, and if your course isn‚Äôt a full year your TA is likely done their marking and getting paid for working with your class. Still, I would recommend sending over a quick email to them, thanking them for their feedback but asking them if they noticed anything in your writing that you have room to work on. While it‚Äôs not guaranteed, they may take a Quick Look back at your paper and offer some advice. The more specific you can be with asking for advice, the easier it is to give it to you. 

You have a right to proper feedback on your work. We do our best to give it to you within the (often very strict) guidelines from the prof and the time allocated to each assignment. It‚Äôs why at UofT you rarely have TAs in your actual class (at least in humanities, idk about the sciences) and you never meet them in person, unlike a lot of smaller schools. We simply don‚Äôt have the hours to go, as much as we‚Äôd like to.",comment,7

It does not matter how busy your TA might be: They are being paid to work a set number of hours on their TA duties and they must fulfill them regardless of what else they may have on their plate. Having a thesis to write is a heavy burden but not a free pass on falling short of the responsibilities they took.

If you're seriously convinced that the feedback was generated by an AI, you should 100% report this to the main course instructor. If you're not so sure, and if confronting the TA directly is an option, I think you should do that. Do not accuse them, just ask for feedback and clarifications to see if they actually read your paper and if their reaction is consistent with what they wrote in their feedback.",comment,2

The latter is plagiarism, the former is not so. In extremely large classes of more than 700+, TAs often have a prewritten blurb that they will tweak a bit for each student. If you want more feedback, just ask. If you want the TA to get into trouble, I doubt they would be found guilty of anything.

I'm actually not sure how I feel about this specific situation. GAI is everywhere, and it has the potential to make our lives a lot easier. But where is the line?

For OP (student), the line is using GAI to generate any content used to draft an assignment. I think it's ok to brainstorm with GAI and help to organize your thoughts. Even generating an outline with the help of GAI I think is kosher. However, using GAI to generate substantive content or using GAI verbatim is crossing a line.

However, I use GAI all the time to generate marking rubrics, and I copy some of that content verbatim.

For the TA, my first thought is that they didn't do anything wrong UNLESS the feedback was sub-standard. OP swears it sounds like GAI and because of that, it's slop. My guess is that it's a higher quality of feedback than the TA was capable of generating independently. If the TA generated a draft of the feedback that they reviewed and found was it was accurate, I see no problem in copying verbatim.

**The difference is that students are here to learn, while TAs are here to facilitate that learning. I don't need the TA to be original, I need the TA to be consistent.**

My second thought is that the TA probably had to give your intellectual property to a GAI platform, likely with an explicit user policy that doing so means that the IP now belongs to ChatGPT (or whatever). THAT is problematic.",comment,2

I could also see a situation where the TA submitted the paper to an AI, reviewed the response, saw it made sense and just used it as is. I assumed the suspicion was that the TA may have fed the assignment to an AI without even reading it, asked it for an evaluation, and then just returned that to the student without revising it. Now that, I insist, looks like academic misconduct to me. There may be several reason why older students, and not random unqualified people, are hired as TA's for courses, and one of those is you want someone grading papers that has actual expertise in the field. Chatbots are famously unreliable when it comes to content, and they can be fooled with relative ease into telling you the opposite of what they may initially have said. As a form of feedback, an AI-generated response (assuming the ""Write up some feedback so I don't have to read it""-type situation) is absolutely worthless because it comes with no guarantee of accuracy, and besides it's something that any student could get on their own without paying a PhD candidate to do it. Even worse if it's actually being used for grading ‚Äî personally I see that as marginally better than drawing grades from a preset distribution and assigning them randomly to the students. These people are going to school, paying top dollar and working like crazy, to get an education from interacting with experienced people and a fair unbiased evaluation of their efforts. As it stands today, no AI is able to provide either, and abusing it to get out of your own responsibilities is without exaggeration a form of academic misconduct.  
  
(Imagine if you were trying to publish an article and it got rejected because Reviewer 2 refused to read your work, and instead chose to feed it to chatGPT and submit the response to the editor as their review. You'd be pretty pissed I'm sure).

Now I wasn't meaning to throw gasoline on the fire, and I do fully agree that the situation should be assessed carefully before escalating. That's why I said ""If you're seriously convinced"", and why I suggested talking to the TA first to see if the content of the feedback may have actually come from them. Which is essentially what I would do with a student if I suspected they (ab)used ChatGPT to cut corners doing their homework. If that turned out to be impossible (e.g. because OP mentioned having a history with this particular TA) I would see no harm in scaling up to the main instructor, as long as the tone is appropriate. Not to look for justice, but to report that an investigation might be in order, and then let them sort it out and adjust the grades if needed.",comment,2

I‚Äôm not expecting a book review, and that‚Äôs one of the reasons this feedback blurb rang alarm bells: it was like 4000 characters long. Not sure if I‚Äôve just been lucky in the past, but at least for final assignments I have usually gotten some form of useful feedback. Even if that is short like edit tangents to make your main points clearer or specific feedback about how I used a source, it has been very helpful. I‚Äôm definitely not looking for quantity here, but I think if they have read our work enough to submit a mark they probably have some form of explanation as to why I got a certain mark and how to improve.",comment,3

For context, this TA has never replied to any of the numerous emails I have sent throughout the semester and is seemingly resistant to learning how to operate quercus. Other students in our course have had similar experiences. That history of showing that their position as a TA is probably low on their priority list is the only reason why I would suspect they would use AI to cut corners again here. Worse because I really enjoyed the professor for this course because he was such an expert in this field. The bad course organization and admin work by the TA ruined it for me.",comment,3

https://www.viceprovostundergrad.utoronto.ca/16072-2/teaching-initiatives/generative-artificial-intelligence/

How can I tell if a student used a generative AI system on my assignment? Can I or should I use one of the new AI-detection programs?

The University does not support the use of AI-detection software programs on student work. None of these software programs have been found to be sufficiently reliable, and they are known to incorrectly flag instances of AI use in human-written content. Some of the AI-detection software programs assess if a piece of writing was generated by AI simply on its level of sophistication.

Sharing your students‚Äô work with these software programs without their permission also raises a range of privacy and ethical concerns.

However, instructors are encouraged to continue to use their traditional methods for detection of potential academic misconduct, including meeting with a student to discuss their assignment in person.",comment,21

This right here is the ai detector, 9/10. If you ask them to rephrase the major points in their own words and they can't, that's the actual red flag.
There's a reason many teachers as for an in class writing sample in the beginning of the term too. It sets a baseline",comment,6
