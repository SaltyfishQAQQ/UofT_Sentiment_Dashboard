no proper friends after my first year at st george,BBerry7527,1epukuv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1epukuv/no_proper_friends_after_my_first_year_at_st_george/,1723408045.0,"basically what the title says ‚Äî i‚Äôve made about 2-3 proper friends this whole entire year lol. idk what it was, but on my end i tried my best to be friendly to people and make new friends, especially those of my ethnicity (indian), as I never had any indian friends myself. However, most groups formed quickly and would always give weird, judgy stares or just look at me or my friend weirdly, like when someone stares at u for too long and makes a weird/judgy face?? idk how to explain it tbh it was just uncomfortable and honestly ruined it for me. Like what did i do to you?? 

I became less social and hated going out, even to the point of missing my classes and just being a homebody. 

I‚Äôll be entering my second year at utsg now, and I still feel pretty demotivated with no proper friend group. What should I do? Do ppl in big groups still accept new ppl after 1st year (lol), especially the indian people? 

I honestly just want that stereotypical college experience with a huge group of amazing friends ‚Äî i don‚Äôt wanna miss out.

Has someone else also gone through this or am i finally having an original experience for once lol. pls help/lmk anything is appreciated.

edit: I‚Äôm not saying i don‚Äôt appreciate my current 3 friends, they‚Äôre amazing! i just want to be part of a big friend group yk i always have. Thanks for all the responses btw! ",submission,52

The best thing you can do is what you‚Äôve already done; be open to conversations, be yourself, be confident, and don‚Äôt be discouraged by bad experiences. Don‚Äôt go into conversations trying to ‚Äúmake new friends,‚Äù Just be urself and see where things go naturally. 

I also just finished first year, and like to think I have a really nice solid friend group. Groups are almost never made all at once, different people come in at different times, and each time it‚Äôs spontaneous. Sure groups are already close, but as long as ur being urself, the right people will always gravitate towards you :)",comment,22

If I were you I‚Äôd go to nightclubs or bars and try to go out even if you hate it just put on a smile and get networking. Luck will find those who look for it,comment,10

Professional and post graduate school at UofT was vastly different and positive. I am still friends with so many of them and go out a few times a year.",comment,5

So don't feel discouraged! Your experience is normal and I guarantee there are more people in your situation than you think. Keep talking to new people and looking for opportunities to make new friends.¬†


Also, instead of just looking for a ""big group"" to join, you can also try inviting out the friends you've made so far to do something fun, and maybe those friends can invite their own friends as well, expanding your network more organically.¬†",comment,2

I also wonder if there's a sense in which OP has an image of ""a large friend group"" like the kind they have seen in movies or shows, or groups of people who happen to be walking around campus together, but in practice I am not sure if the majority of people really have this sort of ""large group of good friends""-  more like, you might hang out in a big group of people sometime, but I am not super confident that all 4-5-6+ people in that clump are your good friends.
