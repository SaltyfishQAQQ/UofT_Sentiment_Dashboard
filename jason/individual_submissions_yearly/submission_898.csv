Also, talk to a healthcare provider if you can. I have the same problem as you, plus a few others, and I can tell you that if nothing's done about it, things will get worse.

The thing about depression is you don't have the will to literally live sometimes, let alone study. During this time, reach out to your instructors and prioritize your health. At moments when it isn't as bad, ""ignore"" your depressive thoughts and feelings and start studying because there's literally not much else you can do. For me, nothing will ever get done if I let my thoughts be the basis of my actions.

Finally, don't apply the same performance standards academically or cognitively to yourself when you're depressed. Depression makes it harder to function, that's why it's important to seek help. Be kind to yourself. Being in university is hard; having depression makes it that much harder. Take care of yourself,  join a sport, take your vitamins, reach out, and try not to lose touch with the world and isolate.",comment,12

Forst off, if you haven’t already seek treatment. Antidepressants can help a lot. After that Forcing yourself into a routine is essential. I found I had to break everything up into defined/small goals. Also find things that minimize your symptoms. For me regular exercise helped a lot.",comment,3

I know several people who struggle with depression and/or anxiety, and they have been able to receive accommodations from UofT for it. The one caveat is you generally need a medical diagnosis to get accommodations, but you can potentially go through Health & Wellness (or your GP) to do so if you don't have a diagnosis already.",comment,2

If it makes you feel better, most people who use accessibility services do so for mental health issues like anxiety and/or depression. By the way, if you don't know how to get started, you can check out the Health and Wellness mental health resources on their site. If you haven't talked to a healthcare provider yet, you should book an appointment at your GP's clinic or the H&W clinic for a mental health assessment. Don't wait! I know what you are going through and the reluctance you must be feeling, like what you're going through is not a real issue and that you are the problem. But let me assure you that what you're going through is very real and is definitely an uncontrollable factor. As someone who has a learning disability, I can confidently say that depression is worse in terms of what's limiting me academically. Remember, if you honestly want to improve and not let things get even more out of hand, seek help. The same thoughts that caused you to be in this predicament are stopping you from getting better.",comment,1
