Stop this right now.
Sign up and just go. 
Stop overthinking. Give yourself 4 seconds to make the decision to go or not to go, and follow through.",comment,5

University is the best time to make friends. Once you start working its harder to find people who fit your schedule. You will look back and realize that these fears you have are very small and insignificant as you grow older.,comment,2
