I'm in no way a good person and It's time for me to leave,deleted,1f8ikp0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f8ikp0/im_in_no_way_a_good_person_and_its_time_for_me_to/,1725417769.0,"I'm not saying I'm bad as in being a dick to everyone (because it's not my ethic), but I personally don't think I'm ready for Uni. 

  
I'm good at checking emails, socially interreacting with other people on campus, maintaining my self-esteem, but I think it's probably time that I need to get my bottled up feelings off my chest.

  
I had become an scholar for my excellent work in 12th grade three years ago, and I was accepted into the university. I was excited at first. My first year, due to my naïve knowledge of the difficulty of the university, was not great, as I wasn't doing well in eco. Second year was worse. I found eco to be too difficult, despite all of the studying that I had done, and I ended up not doing so well. 

  
The thing is, I should have realized that University is difficult and I should have made my own decision of going to either any college since I now realize that it's not the perfect fit for me. 

  
In addition, I started to become stressed out and infuriated, and besides contemplating transferring from the UofT to some college, or just taking up sports instead (either basketball or track and field).

  
I have no choice. Once again, I may be a friendly person, but in no way I am competent on being a University student.

  
I'm sorry.",submission,35

I was excellent at school during high school and loved attending class and doing homework. 

Now that I’m in university, in my third year, I can confidently say that I despise school and everything about it. Whether I was ready or not doesn’t matter, the fact is school isn’t for everyone and it’s only too late to realize once you’re in it. I totally regret every decision I’ve made school related, and wish I could go back and do it all over again from grade 10 choosing courses.
