Urgently need help on what to do with life (entering 2nd year),Zealousideal_Back959,1duvacy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1duvacy/urgently_need_help_on_what_to_do_with_life/,1720057945.0,"So basically my entire life I have been struggling financially, as a matter of fact I am homeless right now. I have finished my first year (Computer Science + Math) but due to these struggles I did terrible in my winter semester and will be on academic probation as a result. I dont have any family or any sources of financial support whatsoever, and have been trying to get a job since Grade 12. For the past year I've been eating 1 or 2 meals per day hoping things would get better but nothing has changed. OSAP and UTAPS collectively gave me about $3000 which I have been living off since September. I dont understand why the amount was so low, I tried appealing and applying for extra support but I got nothing. I feel like I am slowly dying because I simply cannot support my health anymore. I've been considering dropping out and somehow joining the military because I do not know what other options I have. Please does anyone have any idea on what I can do?",submission,30

OSAP only granting you 3k means they have taken other sources of income into account. 

The registrar is extremely helpful with assisting those who are homeless and in need of emergency funding.

People don't need a life story from you, but lying ain't cool. This isn't r/ontariograde12",comment,17

I would suggest postponing taking courses, so youre still enrolled in uoft but like not currently taking courses or soemthing (talk to an qcademic advisor regarding this). And in the meantime  start hunting for jobs actively. Since you are in comp sci and math, i assume ur pretty smart. Theres a lot of high school students who need tutoring esp for math, maybe offer your services there. Maybe apply to varsity tutors, they dont require a degree for u to start working there, just give a very good interview thats the hard part. You can also work as a cashier or something. Maybe work in mathnasium or something. Bascially try to monetize your mathematical skills. A lot of ppl need math help and you have that advantage. Once you start making some money  hopefully it relaxes you mentally and you can get back into studies. You can also apply to become a TA which pays quite well. Good luck, do not give up hope, you will do great !!!",comment,6

This is of course a medium-long term solution. With a better redistribution of wealth maybe Jeff won't travel to the moon, but workers might stop being so damn anxious and probably will find time to hang out with others and enjoy the little time we have in this adventure we call life",comment,-4
