CHM247/249 still forcing 8:30 AM labs in the past couple years?,WideProposal,1d4as1k,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d4as1k/chm247249_still_forcing_830_am_labs_in_the_past/,1717093597.0,"Considering a chemistry specialist but I have a 2.5h commute each way and learnt from old posts that CHM247 had 8AM labs. Looked at the current summer timetable and found that both 247 and 249 have 8:30AM labs in all PRA sections. Not sure if that’s simply a coincidence or only a summer session occurrence. Those who know of the Fall/Winter sessions for these two courses in the past couple years, are they still all at 8:30AM? I’d have to leave home at 6AM to make it ><",submission,24

U cover more topics and more lab sessions. 247 have labs biweekly and 249 have labs weekly.,comment,1
