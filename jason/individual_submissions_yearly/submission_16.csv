Summary: At a Halloween party at the Theta Delta Chi fraternity on Madison Ave., Toronto, two individuals, 19-year-old Jacob Alves and a 15-year-old girl, allegedly forced their way in after being denied entry and began attacking people with a knife. Five people were injured, with three being stabbed, including one person with life-threatening injuries. Alves and his accomplice are facing charges, including aggravated assault and attempted murder. The incident is still under investigation, and the allegations have not yet been proven in court.

Summary: Jacob Alves, 23 (article written in 2023, 19 at the time) was convicted of manslaughter for the 2019 stabbing death of 19-year-old Firdous Nabizada at a fraternity party in Toronto‚Äôs Annex neighborhood. Originally charged with second-degree murder, Alves was found guilty of the lesser charge due to his extreme intoxication. The court presented conflicting narratives: prosecutors argued Alves intended to kill, while his defense claimed self-defense or diminished responsibility due to intoxication. Alves was also convicted of multiple counts of assault, while his 15-year-old accomplice was acquitted of murder but found guilty of other assault-related charges.

Also it doesn‚Äôt help the victim that people are usually VERY intoxicated, and well‚Ä¶ initially you are the one who chose to attend their party.

I am not saying that choice makes the assault any less valid or harmful. Rape is rape, but in this case there are a lot of different bullshits they can pull. Especially considering many of them come from wealthy families.

It is hard to prove that they meant to sexually assault someone. Like in court you have to prove that they had planned it all along.
