what is up with professors lacking some empathy? ,Extreme_King5955,1hafw1m,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hafw1m/what_is_up_with_professors_lacking_some_empathy/,1733767240.0,"I have an assignment that was due last week, but I couldn’t submit it because I’ve been struggling with my mental health after being sexually assaulted by another student in fourth year. The assignment was announced within the first week or so of November and I was able to complete majority of it since its's a short essay.

Currently i'm going through with the reporting process of the assault. all my other professors seem to understand except this one that is relatively new. I asked for an extension—possibly until January 9th (I won't even need this long that's what was just suggested towards me because professors can accept term work for the Fall up to then), which is when term work can be submitted. 

And my professors reply to me was that, it's up to students to time manage more effectively and start earlier. Like hello??

I didn't outwardly state to them I was sexually assaulted but I don't think I should necessarily have to disclose that just for you to somewhat empathic especially after mentioning a hospital visit.

i'm not expecting my professor to just let everything fly just because this happened to me. My mental health has been pretty low in November and I've reached out for support. I know being assaulted is not the end but it does make me feel a little hopeless about university or everything in general.

I've kept up with my work in all of my classes, I just wasn't able to finish this one with the time permitted. it doesn't help that this is a full-year course too, so I'm not sure why it seems impossible to give an extension considering this is like our second assignment of the year and the next one wont be until February.

but whatever literally have no idea what to do, because they're basically telling me to just take the zero on an assignment",submission,95

It's not necessarily that they're unsympathetic. Profs are being overloaded with this kind of request and it's not really their job to evaluate the legitimacy of claims.,comment,10

If you’d like, feel free to pm me or message them on instagram/ email them. myself and the group have supported survivors through trying to navigate getting extensions/navigating the university’s system after assault and we’d be happy to support you as well. no pressure to reach out, but we’re here if you’d like to chat <3 sending you lots of care and strength",comment,22

I went to her for mental health, yes I had to get a medical form signed though to get out of practicum (it was the easiest thing to do because by default, professors need to honour your request if you have doctor’s approval so if you can get one to sign off, that would definitely help). She’s there to support you, and will even reach out to your professors directly and you do not need to disclose any specific details",comment,2

Of course you can hold grudge against them for what seemed to happen during a couple or two email exchange, but it is possible that either of the followings happened: a) you didn't communicate your need clearly, b) consequently the prof mistook you as another student who begged for extension when it was on them for failing to manage time, c) thus the prof is convinced that granting you the extension is unfair to those who submitted on time. These reasons are more likely than the prof wanting to screw this student in particular. 

If you can withhold the belief that the prof is beyond reasoning, you could book a private office hour with them to explain your situation. You never have to mention that you were sexually assulted. But if you can bring it up in reddit to establish your case, you can mention to the prof how being a victim to some crime and having to visit hospital for it had affected you beyond you capacity of time management. If they are still stone cold, consult with your academic advisor and do a petition with your college register. 

There are almost always help to rectify unjust situations, so don't lose hope or assume malice just yet.",comment,3

I can imagine how it feels, having put through the wringer myself. Some professors and staff at this institution lack even a semblance of empathy – and I understand that a couple bad apples make it very taxing to empathize, but I’ve often felt incredibly dehumanized and othered trying to each out for support. I’ve had an equally terrible experience trying to seek support with the SVPS, but once you do get in touch with them they can and will reach out to your instructor or the Registrar for you. I also recommend support from the TRCC’s crisis/chat support line, I’ve connected with a case worker to get documentation to petition a semester’s worth of coursework. Most importantly, I do hope you’re taking care of yourself. I know healing isn’t linear or easy, and I hope you’re getting the support you need otherwise. All of this is secondary, and there are options incase you need more time and energy to deal with academic concerns. Feel free to reach out if you need any advice, or just a person to talk to 🤍",comment,1

which at this point if i have to say something for my professor to understand, its just not my first pick option. i gave my prof a VOI from health and wellness, but like they literally didn't seem to care. which is kinda insane",comment,18

I just find the situation a bit odd.

in my email, I did communicate my needs clearly, mentioning my mental health and hospital visit. I’m not sure how my professor could categorize me with another student begging for an extension, especially since most students aren’t being hospitalized during finals. I also provided a VOI that clearly states some assignments may be late due to some circumstances. Additionally, my professor knows I’m registered with Accessibility Services and I mentioned this was recommended by my advisor to have a due date for Jan 9th.

I don’t think granting the extension would be unfair, considering that papers are being marked anonymously, so it wouldn’t make a difference to other students. Again, I don't think I should have to mention I am a victim to a crime for my professor to understand slightly. The reason why I said it seems like there's a lack of empathy because of how they replied stating how next semester I should ""time block better"" to help with unexpected obstacles. Even if my professor doesn't know I was assaulted, I still think thats kind of a weird thing to say with someone who is facing mental health challenges. but thats just me

thanks for your advice about petitioning, but im not sure if that would be the case considering the course is still going on and my professor has the ability to grant an extension.",comment,14

If you have a properly completed VOI, and were clear in your request to the instructor, such that it wasn't merely a case of misunderstanding etc, your registrar should be able to lobby on your behalf. A registrar's letter is treated as a ""recognized form\[\] of documentation"" at UofT, and ""should be considered sufficient on its own when requesting academic consideration"" (I'm quoting from the [academic handbook](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/faculty-staff/teaching/academic-handbook), section 4.7). That letter, coupled with VOI, would be strong documentation. They're likely busy right now, like any office during exam season, but will be able to help you out if you'd like.

Also: Jan 9th is the deadline for H1F-courses. A Y1Y-course is not restricted to that date. So if it's slow moving through SVPS or the registrar, it shouldn't by itself impact your chances of an extension.

You stating that you were struggling with your mental health and that you were in hospital is not documented proof. Unfortunately students lie and cheat all the time meaning that for a genuine request you need to follow whatever protocols exist regarding providing documentation for extenuating circumstances.,comment,9

Which should be sufficient enough for the professor to not respond the way they did. If OP VOI form states severe or even moderate it indicates term work may be late.,comment,10
