Try to research about the question‚Äôs concept, I am not talking about copy pasting the question to find a solution, I am talking about like if question mentions Fibonacci Sequence, research about what it is and how it works etc.
For final and midterm, you should be good as long as you understand the psets. So after they release the solutions on psets try to understand the solution. 2 years ago we had in tutorial practice problems, those problems were also pretty close to what they asked in exams. Imo, exams are way easier than psets. Also, first pset is the hardest one not because of its material, but because it is the first time you are writing proofs. Right now you should work on writing proofs and how the proofs are structured, because that‚Äôs what you will do for the rest of the course.
Good luck!",comment,15
