It was never meant to hold lectures, and it shows with its lack of desks. I also find the seats are uncomfy and a bit small, but that's more a me problem I suppose. 

On the flip side, I would say the best is Isabel Bader Theatre. Comfy chairs, good sightlines, and great acoustics, which makes sense since it was designed to be a theatre.",submission,89

The absolute worst offenders are some of the SS rooms and Alumni Hall (AH) for not even having left-handed tables.
