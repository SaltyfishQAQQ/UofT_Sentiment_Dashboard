Classes are way smaller, professors knows who everyone is. And the expectation is everyone is getting no lower than a B+.

It's also a lot harder to get into a grad program than undergrad. Think of grad school classes as only being filled with the top 5% people in your undergrad classes.

Admission rates definitely vary by faculty and school, and you can get much more info on that via GradCafe or grad school admission/apps subreddits. Not sure what you mean by lower GPA here, but be sure to calculate based on your last 60 and last 30 credit hours, since those will be the GPAs graduate programs consider you under in Canadian schools. So long as you meet the minimum GPA requirement and have the requirements, you’ll be considered. 

It’s still important to have a great statement of purpose/intent and ensure you have referees who will speak highly of you in a not so generic way. If you can’t get referees who know you super well, you can always supply them with a document with information on the programs you’re applying to, what your goals are following it, and why you’re a good fit for the program so they can utilize that to create a more personalized reference letter. If you get to the interview stage (where applicable), that’s your chance to stick out despite a “lower” GPA, as well. If you’re still in 3rd year, you have a chance to try and pull that GPA up further for grad school purposes. Best of luck!",comment,4
