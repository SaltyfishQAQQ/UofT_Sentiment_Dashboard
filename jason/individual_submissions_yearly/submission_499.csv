Tell me why this prof has the audacity to be like ‚ÄúRaise your hand if you‚Äôre taking it for the second time üòÅ‚Äù FIRST OF ALL THATS SO MESSY. Second of all, a lot of people were hesitant to raise their hand so most kept their hand down I guess. Then, she pulls out a percentage like ‚ÄúI know about 40% of you are retaking this course.‚Äù Mother Mary are you serious right now??? You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôve been teaching this course for a while and you‚Äôre unphased by your horrible pass rate??? What kinda professor‚Ä¶. anyways.

I understand of course biochem is a super hard concept generally but a lot of it has to do with the type of educator you get, you can‚Äôt convince me otherwise. This being said, I‚Äôm going to ask the age-old question: what can I do to maximize the grade I get (ie passing the course with at least a 75). Any advice would be appreciated (should I read the supplemental readings, should I memorize stuff not mentioned in class, etc) üôå

A little concerned ‚Ä¶ any advice would be appreciated for BCH210,quicklivvy,l2whpj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1clw4bn/a_little_concerned_any_advice_would_be/l2whpj3/,1715037112.0,"i took bch210 for the first time last summer and got an A. I put a lot of work in that class and my efforts rewarded me. the class was overall alright, and from what i can tell with my friends, the summer term is easier than the fall in my opinion. 

first, don‚Äôt stress yourself, it is a doable class. if u‚Äôre scared u won‚Äôt be able to do it, that in itself will affect your performance. second, UNDERSTAND the content, don‚Äôt just rote memorize it unless it‚Äôs all 20 amino acids. say your line of reasoning for every practice problem out loud if you need to. whatever u do, have a line of logic behind why u choose ur answers. once u start guessing, it‚Äôs over. third, burn those amino acid structure, codes and names into ur brain. i spent over the course of 3 days memorizing everything by rewriting the same thing over and over again. after a year later, i still remember all 20 just from the sheer amount of times i made myself write it down last summer.

in my opinion, the midterm and final were fair. HOWEVER‚Äîi had an absolute HEADACHE trying to decipher some of the wording in her weekly quizzes. pay very close attention and vigilant about the possible interpretations of her wording. it is no fault of ur own if u get them wrong, I personally also felt some were petty.

how did i study for my exams? i annotated every tutorial problem and lecture on my ipad. i stared at my ipad lecture slides, then recited conceptual ideas out loud so I would be confident that i actually understood the prof‚Äôs lesson and line of reasoning for why certain things are the way they are. grab a friend and teach them the lesson. teach it to your stuffies. teach the air, it doesnt matter so long as u know it.",comment,25

Personally for me, it was super memorising heavy, like KNOWING everything on the slides was a bare minimum. The test questions itself are more application-based though. For example, in the 1st half, they teach you purification methods. Knowing how those work is the bare minimum, then they'd give you a scenario and ask which purification method you'd use.

My advice for the 1st half: start early with memorising the amino acids. Do that whenever you can (when you're shitting, eating, walking to school, etc. Legit shout out a letter of the alphabet then recall the AA name and draw out the structure in your head. U'd memorise it in no time). Generally, just note down everything ur prof says because they usually test even the smallest details üòî i still felt the midterm was quite fair n not too hard overall tho.

2nd half..... now that was pure memorisation and recall-style exam questions. You'd literally just be memorising pathways: metabolites, enzymes and their regulation (glycolysis, lipolysis, protein synth, etc.). Honestly dk how i survived that, short-term memory ftw i guess? (Legit dont remember most things anymore lol)

How I study (I study like this for all my courses):
Since this class was online async, i just set time every week to watch the lectures and annotate the slides as i watch. I write down everything the prof said (sometimes word-for-word bcs i need context when i study lol). It takes a while cos I pause often (20min vid could take an hour to do ;-;). But when I actually do study for the exam, i don't hv to rewatch the vids again :)
Come exam time (usually 2-3 days before), i'd open my slide notes and a paper notebook and handwrite my slide notes into bulletpoint form in my notebook, draw diagrams if needed, copy down figures if needed, basically convert those annotated slides into notes in a format i learn best with :). When im done with that I just keep reviewing and memorising those handwritten notes over n over again + do practice questions (after i feel confident in my knowledge, in one go as if it were the exam).

Gluck to u and may ur brainpower and memorisation skills prevail ü•≤üëç",comment,10

It‚Äôs not the content that is the hardest but the wording. I took it in 2023 fall and personally found some questions were weirdly worded and you need to pay attention to them since one word difference can entirely change the meaning:/,comment,7

The content during Fall was defo worse. 

IMO her makeups (all short ans) are easier than the actual Midterm. 

Definitely agree with quicklivvy that you need to have a line of reasoning for every slide. 

For memorising amino acids, I like to use mnemonics. For example, those that tend to form alpha-branch are LMK ARE Q. I imagine an alpha male handing out his number to someone, saying ‚ÄúLMK if you wanna hangout. I think you ARE Q(cute)‚Äù. Stuff like that HAHAHHAHAH",comment,7

For the first half, don‚Äôt just memorize how the techniques work but understand what technique would you use in a given condition and how to interpret the results (like gel electrophoresis). I found the second half is easier than the first half, and ended up with a higher grade in the final than midterm.",comment,6
