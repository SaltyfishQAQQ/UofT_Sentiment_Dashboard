	•	Innis College
	•	New College
	•	St. Michael’s College
	•	Trinity College
	•	University College
	•	Victoria College
	•	Woodsworth College

Since I live far from Ontario and can’t tour the colleges, I’d really appreciate your insight. If you were back in grade 12 and had the chance to choose again, which college would you pick?

+ I’m applying to Rotman Commerce, Physical and Mathematical Sciences, and Social Sciences.

Thanks in advance!",submission,42

Woodworth, if you don't wanna pay for a meal plan

Victoria, if you want to get a 1k scholarship every year, if you get over a 3.0 or 3.5 GPA every year (I forgot which one) 

New if you're going into stem, (all the stem buildings are basically right next to New) The food is the best in ArtSci. U can use your meal plan at other faculties, too. 

Trinity, because it looks cool (idk much about Trinity besides everyone in their mother that's going to Trinity puts it in their insta bio) 

UC if you want a good all-rounder.",comment,29

If you're interested in a good comparison, here is a good link: [here](https://www.artsci.utoronto.ca/future/student-experience/college-system/college-residence)

I'd choose Innis again in a heartbeat. No mandatory meal plan, decent suite for what it costs, and great socials. Like everyone else said, the college is central to campus and pretty much within a 15-min walk from everything (like Chinatown). Also super close to the St. George subway station on line 1. It's one of the smallest colleges and one of the only two without a mandatory meal plan. Also, it has air conditioning, which other colleges, unlike some UC buildings and St. Mike. 

I met some of my closest friends here! Best of luck to you and your application :) 

(To my knowledge, St. Mike has a meal plan that you can only use at the dining hall. It's a pretty far walk where likely most of your classes will be located if you're doing PMS, SS, and RC, so just something to keep in mind if you pick St. Mike's.)",comment,9

It was the right choice. The dorms are better than any other dorm on campus, assuming you’re fine with cooking for yourself. Having multiple roommates means your experience isn’t so dependent on whether you mesh with one person. And I found friends and community through extracurriculars, so I didn’t really need the social activities that a lot of other colleges offer. 

That being said, if you don’t want to cook for yourself, want the traditional dorm experience, or want to have more of a sense of community from your college, WW probably isn’t for you",comment,5

I’m 100% sure I would choose it again. I lived on rez for my first two years. First year in one of the older buildings, second year in the newer one. Both were enjoyable experiences. I liked that SMC had a lot of history behind its name, lots of nice traditions. I really felt like I was in a community. People that I knew were commuters were either barely there or  got involved with something in the SMC community to get themselves to that side of campus more often-it’s all about what you want and don’t want. I honestly liked that it was on the other side of campus. I liked being close to Bay Street to go for walks and I was close to
Museum, Wellesley, Bay and St. George subway stations. I liked feeling that the main part of campus was “school” and the SMC campus was “home”. Additionally, the Kelly Library on the SMC campus was my fave library to study at because it was close AND I loved the layout and vast amount of seating.",comment,3

i’m a first year and chose WW so i wouldn’t have to pay for a meal plan and cook for myself. this sounds great on paper but in practice it’s terrible.

i’m living with 5 of the messiest people i’ve ever seen, outright refusing the wash dishes or put away anything once they’re done in the kitchen. it’s the most hideous thing just walking by the kitchen, and it’s definitely not inviting to cook at. as a result i end up eating out a few times a week, and really do wish i just had a meal plan instead.",comment,3

I thought this school was so prestigious, but they don’t even help you get a job, and nobody really cares whether you graduated from UofT or McMaster or whatever.
