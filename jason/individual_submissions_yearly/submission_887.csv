Question from an A&S course instructor: what would help you get more out of a humanities class?,smallbuildings,1fuhopl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fuhopl/question_from_an_as_course_instructor_what_would/,1727879747.0,"I'm a sessional instructor working on designing a 200-level history course. I get the sense that with the pandemic, general burnout/trauma, social pressures, availability/temptation to explore generative AI, stress to do well in their majors, the university's use of international students as money cows, etc etc. - students are exhausted and generally end up not getting the most out of humanities courses or don't have a lot of confidence to do work outside of their comfort zones/priorities. So before I set my course syllabus in stone, I was curious: what would you find helpful to do in class or as assignments that would help your confidence generally? Or have fun in the course? Or get a lot out of it? I'm not really interested in offering up a total bird course, but rather I'd be interested in setting aside some time to help students get some useful skills out of the course, if at all possible.",submission,17

I think for 200 level as people are still trying to understand what to do, I think emphasis on exploring ideas than formalism can be great to be more engaged. I guess assignments with more open ended questions that just want you to share your thoughts on paper like a discussion. A lot of folks are too concerned about getting the “correct” answer when there is none, I feel the most important thing is to express how open ended the field is.",comment,3

- giving readings that are as short as possible to get their point across
- giving readings that obviously contrast/are in dialogue with each other. This especially I’ve found has helped me understand the argumentation of the readings by showing how other scholars have responded.
- essay writing support! Especially explaining a brief overview of different historical theories for looking at the material and also showing good and bad examples of analysis.",comment,1

I’ll say lots of my fellow humanities instructors are re-introducing exams bc of generative AI. I really can’t remember the last time I saw a final exam in a humanities course before last year, and then bam, every A&S course has exams last year and this year. Would an in-class test be preferable? ",comment,7

I should also clarify my personal position, which is that AI, to me, is fine when used as a tool, but not as an agent. But in a humanities course, a prompt might ask, let's say, what is Tintoretto's contribution to the stylistic maturing of early modern art? And discuss an example of his work that you think demonstrates your argument. Such a prompt, seemingly simple, might have been used in an A&H course for a low-stake writing assignment (= not a full essay, but a short paper to demonstrate engagement with the course material). But now that prompt gets plugged into a ChatGPT, which means A&H instructors can no longer engage in low-stake writing, which was really, really a good thing, reducing pressure on students and also letting instructors set multiple small assignments to track progress instead of relying on a final exam. I hope this makes sense.

This unfortunately also means we do need to give some other means of evaluating work. It's also hard to make these writing assignments in-class only because A&H instructors do take their coursework and teaching content seriously, and we do need time to teach. We don't necessarily only want to think of themselves as relief-providers for students riddled with tests in other majors. I really miss being able to give writing assignments though.",comment,2
