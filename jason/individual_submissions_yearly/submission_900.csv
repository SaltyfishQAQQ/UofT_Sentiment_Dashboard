On one hand, I know that CE has both hardware and software, and while I do enjoy software more, I am interesting in learning more about the hardware side of computers. CE also does have less math/proof based courses. I've also heard that co-op is better in the CE program compared to CS. However, CE does have a higher workload compared to CS.

On the other hand, CS is a lot more software focused, with a lower workload. However, there is a lot of proofs and math involved, which I don't enjoy too much. Additionally, there are the POST requirements for CS.

Which program would be a better choice for me? Additionally, does either program offer better/worse prospects for entering a software-related career after graduating?",submission,17

Last year I got accepted to both UTSG CS & CE, and decided to go with the latter because of my interests in hardware and I don't regret it... yet hehe.

If you are already dead set on software there is no point in enduring through 2 years of electromagnetics and hardware courses just to get the same jobs as CS people.

The ECE curriculum in the first 2 years has only 2 programming courses with a software design course and we do not delve into computational theory or proofs as much as CS students.  The rest is hardware, electromagnetics, circuit analysis, signal processing, etc.

However if you are interested in hardware, ECE is great imo. There are 5 hardware/physics/electronics streams you can go into which delve into many broad areas of ECE, all the way from power electronics to computer architecture. And suppose you lose your interest in hardware halfway through, no worries because you can always switch to to the software stream or do projects on your own and get a SWE job.

To address some other things,

>I've also heard that co-op is better in the CE program compared to CS.

I do not believe one field has an inherent advantage over the other when it comes to co-op. It's true there are more lucrative jobs in software than there are in hardware though as other users have posted.

>CE does have a higher workload compared to CS.

Largely depends on what courses you take in CS, in theory you can make a schedule in CS 2x or 3x as harder as ECE if you overload on all hard courses and take no bird courses however most friends I know usually don't.

As for POST, supposedly they changed the rules and it is much more lax now if you are admitted in-stream CS, so I would not worry about that.",comment,12

It's just a more tight knit program with more group projects, skule activities, and in my opinion overall easier to make friends. 

Not sure if that's important to you, or if others would disagree though.",comment,7
UoFT St George Computer Science vs Computer Engineering,Just2Ghosts,l3pvg33,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cq8me0/uoft_st_george_computer_science_vs_computer/l3pvg33/,1715526218.0,"How badly do you not want to do the proof course? MAT137 (For CS) is pretty brutal but passable if you get your stuff straight from the start and you put the effort in. And you only NEED to pass it in order to get into CS, for both in stream and out of stream. If your out of stream and you really don't want to do proofs you can take MAT135+136 but I don't recommend it because you have additional minimum grades to worry about and then your forced to take higher level proof courses anyways in the forms of CSC236. I can't speak to the difficulty of the math in engineering because I'm not in it but I think MAT186+MAT187 are about equivalent to MAT135+136, being a lot more application heavy, but I think the computations and math you've got to do is way more tedious and time consuming in 186/187 than in 135/136. 

Are elective classes important to you? To my knowledge CE students get very little room for elective classes and its more of a predetermined schedule, whereas the prereq credits for CS are only 2.0/5.0 (CSC148/165 + MAT137) OR 2.5/5.0 (CSC110 + MAT137 + CSC111 OR CSC108+148+165 + MAT137). Leaving you with up between 5-6 spaces for any class of your choosing (probably take off a credit for back-up PoSTs realistically). Personally I used this space to fill up with easy courses to take the load off the other courses but I ended up really enjoying ALL my electives way more than any of the required courses. If you have the appropriate transfer credits coming in you can choose to just not take a course instead of an elective and enjoy the break while still graduating in the same time frame. Most pre-requisite courses are required for PoST though and you can't use transfer credits for them so be aware of that. PoST also allows you to double major or acquire different minors way more easily than engineering, so keep that in mind too. (Think a major in Econ with a major in CS, or Stats+CS, or Math+CS, or a minor in math, minor in philosophy, major in CS, possibilities are endless)

I cannot speak to the workload differences, but do keep in mind this is a university, and there is a good amount of workload no matter the area you are in.

I think job prospects are equal for both programs. Job acceptance depends way more on the effort an individual puts in rather than whether they went to UofT CS or CE. Maybe you'll have an easier time getting internships in engineering because of the projects you can get exposed to, I've no clue honestly. Point being is worry more about making yourself appealing to employers once you get into your program I guess.

I wouldn't really worry too much about the PoST requirement if you are in stream. A 70/77 in 110/111 is pretty achievable for most and you only need to pass MAT137. The same cannot be said if you are out of stream. The PoST requirements are not a specific number and change every year for CSC148+165 depending on other students' performances and how many spaces are available. If you are confident in your ability you shouldn't be worried as 148/165 are relatively easy (compared to other UofT courses) to get 90s+ in if you really know your stuff. But 165 is entirely math and proofs, albeit simple and very much manageable, they are still proofs and you expressed your dislike for them. 148 is OOP in Python, if you have any significant history in any OOP language (1+ year of serious coding in Java/Python/C++) you will pass that class with flying colors without revising a single bit. You also still only need to pass MAT137.

It comes down to this, basically: How badly do you not want to do math? And how important are taking elective classes/getting a dual major or minors?",comment,10

First year you will do almost no programming, there’s a single C course you take in the winter and it’ll be the easiest course you take all year based on your programming interests. Second year is hell if you don’t like circuits and physics. It’s hell regardless but I hated the circuit courses and found them pretty hard. I can’t speak for CE, but if you just wanna do programming after your graduate we get the same jobs.

Yes CE will be harder than CS because engineering is controlled by the accreditation ppl so there’s a bunch of classes you HAVE to take and CE labs take forever.",comment,1

What about with the onset of AI rn? I have little interest in hardware, but I'm strongly considering CE just for more flexible job prospects.   
I wouldn't consider myself in the top 50% of programmers, so im deathly afraid of AI replacing most entry level swe jobs.  
As such I was considering CE or Indy with a minor in business.

The only things left will be jobs where humans are required by regulation or social norms (e.g. lawyers). Jobs that require physical presence in the real world will only last as long as it takes to develop humanoid robots. I just hope that society adapts fast enough to accommodate massive unemployment. 




For what it's worth I'm extremely bullish on the capabilities of AI and cynical of the ""human spirit"" or whatever you choose to call it.


Edit: in conclusion I wouldn't worry too much about what you want to do cause it doesn't really matter if AI takes over. If it doesn't you're in a field that you find interesting. If you're chasing money until the singularity just go with CS",comment,1
