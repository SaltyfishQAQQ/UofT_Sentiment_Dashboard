THIRTY DOLLARS. my guy i had to check if i have a hip fracture can you just believe me. i'll send a pic.

what's the point of free healthcare if there's goddamn MICRO TRANSACTIONS IRL I DON'T HAVE TO PAY FOR HEALTHCARE BUT I HAVE TO PAY FOR PROOF OF HEALTHCARE

  
edit: i had to go to a non-uoft clinic bc i couldn't walk and uoft didn't have same day appointments",submission,60

If you show up at a walkin clinic to then tell the counter from the start that you're just there to get a form signed, they can make you wait for some family doctor to show up and charge $80. You want to bring up the form to whatever specialist you see instead, after you sign in at  the counter. Should be $20-$30. 

If you need the form for an appeal or some other ongoing accommodation then unfortunately you might need a scan etc",comment,1

my real annoyance aligns with your last point; i was left with the choice between spending finances or consequences for my grade. i needed that voi the same day, so i didn't have better options.",comment,6

Overhead costs are a thing and if we look at it average income for a doctor hourly in Ontario is like 80+ that's 1.35ish a minute I would argue that Doctors around Toronto make significantly more so it's not really unheard-of especially if Ohip doesn't cover that,comment,1
