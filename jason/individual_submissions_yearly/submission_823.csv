Does anyone think it's weird that work study has two maximums?,hebra_ml,1dfcun5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dfcun5/does_anyone_think_its_weird_that_work_study_has/,1718321294.0,"For context, my work-study job for the summer allows a maximum of 15 hours worked per week AND a maximum of 100 hours worked for the entire summer.

I don't know if other work-study positions are like this, but I think it's just a bit odd. I understand that it's a funding thing but still, why?

Like, if I were to work 15 hours a week, every week, I would have been finished with all of my hours by the 7th week of working. Like, can you PLEASE just give us one limit? The amount of work I am doing right now is worthy of 15 hours a week (maybe even more), but I am hesitant to even work over 2 hours in a single day because I want to work until the end of August.

I don't know, it pisses me off. Because it is just simply not enough income coming from it (obviously), so I am looking for another job and entry-level work has proven to be impossible to obtain in Toronto.

Thanks for listening to my rant. Once I find another job I will be less angry at the world <3.",submission,20

Most employers tell you to aim for 8-10 a week. When it’s 15 every week it adds up insanely fast and then you’ve used up all your hours before the end date. Some weeks are also slower in terms of tasks so you aren’t expected to be clocking full hours every time. Some employers even reach out and say to be mindful of the hours.",comment,13

They prevent employers from gaming the program for quick, cheap labor. It’s not meant to be an employer subsidy for a short-term employee, but an incentive to give a student a chance to experience work. The two maximums make sense if you consider the goals of the program.",comment,14

As was pointed out, one reason is to prevent University departments from exploiting your labour.  The other reason is so that you don't prematurely exhaust your available hours, as you noted.

You're pissed off because you're misunderstanding the fundamental purpose of Work Study as a program.  It isn't there to be a primary source of income.  It is there to be a work integrated learning experience so that when you graduate you have actual work experience to put on your resume.",comment,4

I wonder if workplaces would allow students to work some more hours a week without claiming it for income on their timesheet. It still sucks income-wise but I think it’d be great for learning more skills on the job and also showing your boss your dedication.,comment,3

For context I work around 3 shifts each 3-4hours per week. And have 8hours of lectures/tutorials per week for my one course. 

If I worked any more than I currently am it would be difficult to balance. The main issue is definitely the fact they want you to work from start to end date — you’re providing assistance and support usually. If you work 20+ hrs a week, you are likely taking on other peoples’ responsibilities that you shouldn’t be.

My only concern is that maybe they shouldn’t add 100hr cap for the total. Seems extremely low. Especially for me, I get paid $1800 post deduction for the 100hrs at my current pay. But my single engineering course costed me $1600. On top of that, this is a half summer course. I would like the option to at least spend the second half of summer working max weekly hours for some additional income to pay future tuition instead of it being limited to the 100hrs.",comment,1

I'm just doing what I can and getting paid for the work I do for my department.,comment,8

I already do a lot of free labour and it’s made me a very competitive candidate for post-graduate jobs in my field, which will then lead to an acceptance into my desired graduate programs which have an acceptance rate of 1% at all schools in North America. 
Of course it’s not ideal and I’d prefer to get paid for all of the work I do, but at the beginning of my career in my chosen field, I recognize the sacrifices I have to make and which will pay off later on. I don’t mind the free labour, because we don’t live in an ideal world, and I’ll do what I need to do to get my desired degrees and career.",comment,0

You should be able to recognize the difference.",comment,5
