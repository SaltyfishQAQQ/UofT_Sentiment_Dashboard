In the past 2 weeks, Iâ€™ve just been feeling overwhelmed, burnt out, and overall stressed. I know I canâ€™t be the only one and burn outs are a pretty common thing to experience especially if youâ€™re a UofT student lol, but how do yâ€™all deal with it and carry on with the work? I usually try to take breaks to regain the mental strength to do it but itâ€™s hard when so many deadlines are coming up",submission,43

The following semester was brutal. I felt incredibly burnt out and just fed up with school. 

I took 3 months off this summer due to burn out. All my mentors insisted on it before I started my Masters. It felt weird not doing anything for the first month, so I was still working on some projects here and there.

After convocation I mentally checked out. Started working full time in August for one of my profs, he needed the work, I needed the money but also an outlet to get my brain working again.

Thereâ€™s one thing I learned through this whole ordeal. Take time off. You need time for yourself to recover. Whether itâ€™s reading week, or the holidays; you need to block off time for nothing other than yourself. People do it in the professional world all the time, but that culture doesnâ€™t seem to carry over to school (at least for undergrads). 

Course deadlines arenâ€™t easy to juggle when you really need uninterrupted time for yourself; but itâ€™s something you have to work towards to truly get some degree of recovery.",comment,13

Iâ€™d either study few courses while working or donâ€™t work while study full time. Youâ€™ll be able to take on more interesting courses and gain more from studying that way. There are exceptions of course. There are people who can take 7-8 courses at once and 4.0 them. I have no comment in that case.,comment,3

Everyone is burnt out I think, even those in different years/in school/out of school/job/no job etc.

Be nice to yourself! Some things that help me:

1. Try and find some time to go outside every day. Even if itâ€™s just for a few minutes. 

2. Treat yourself. A lot. Lil cute drinks/coffee/matcha to motivate urself. 

3. Find time to do 1 thing you love everyday. Even if itâ€™s just for 10 minutes. Behavioural activation works, you will feel more motivated to accomplish hard things once you start doing something you love. Romanticize boring tasks!!! 

4. Itâ€™s ok to ask for help and use tools. Have alot of readingsâ€¦.Unriddle ai. Get friends to proofread for you if youâ€™re tired. Talk on the phone with someone while you complete a task. Take it one day at a time.

5. Ask for extensions! Most profs are pretty good about this. Helps if you add in how much ur struggling lol they usually feel bad I think ðŸ˜­

6. Itâ€™s ok to drop a course and take one in the summer instead if you can. The best part about uni is there is no rush to graduate. 

Hope this helps!",comment,2

I never felt this elsewhere. The staff in my dept are nice though, but the amount of coursework, complexity, and expectations is through the roof. I find cardio and lifting helps, I stopped doing that for 2 weeks because I wanted to prioritize work but I ended up getting neither done. Today I went back into the gym and I was able to get work done after. Maybe working out burns out those nasty stress hormones or something.",comment,1
