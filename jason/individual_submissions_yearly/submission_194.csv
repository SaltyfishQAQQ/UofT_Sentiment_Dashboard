Seven pieces of advice from a graduating student ,queenofrealitytv,1f59nnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f59nnn/seven_pieces_of_advice_from_a_graduating_student/,1725061340.0,"Today was my last day at UofT. I am finally done my degree! This subreddit helped me so much during my time at UofT. I’d like to pay it forward with 7 pieces of advice. Also, feel free to AMA. I have experience studying life sciences, doing an ROP and independent study projects and navigating UofT as a student with a disability. Good luck to everyone starting and continuing at UofT! 

1. You may work very hard and still not get the results you want. Being okay with this is very helpful for coping with the stress of UofT especially in first year. 
2. You can recover from a bad first semester, but you need to learn from what went wrong and try to improve. My GPA from first semester to graduation went up around 1.2 points. For me this involved taking less classes sometimes and learning how to study for different types of classes
3. For students registered with Accessibility services, don’t be afraid to use your accommodations and be proactive about contacting accessibility services if you need something. 
4. Talk to people in lectures! I meet one of good friends that way. 
5. For students interested in life science research, consider contacting profs with labs in departments that are have less of an undergraduate presence such as dentistry or pharmacy. On the flip side, labs in psychology are often looking for undergraduate students. 
6. Use the writing centre for major writing assignments, they are very helpful and underutilized resource. 
7. It is not the end of the world to not be the traditional student who taking 5 classes per semester, finishing in 4 years and graduating at 21-23, you can still be successful. ",submission,140

Very powerful and I agree with you for the most part (can't speak to the accessibility or life sciences aspect personally).

I'd also like to add to not compare yourself to your peers and to understand that everyone has a different path, circumstance, perspective, and priorities (similar to your comment on taking a reduced courseload). What I mean by this is that internships, GPA, friends, extracirriculars, etc. will vary from person to person and that you shouldn't mark your success by someone else, but rather your own and what goals you want to personally achieve.

It's okay to take advice from others, take inspiration from others, etc. but it's usually not healthy to put others on a pedestal and determine whether you're successful or not, based on either what they say, or their achievements.",comment,18

I remember having done so badly in my 2nd year, my GPA straight up went DOWN by almost a grade point lmao.

But learning from what went wrong and good study habits are so important because even though I took more, harder classes the next academic year, I still achieved significantly better results and my GPA recovered. I've learnt to never be complacent and overestimate your abilities, especially at a place like UofT, and always put in your A++ game in whatever course u take (and whatever u do tbh).",comment,3

It did complicate things in terms of prerequisites for later courses and having a  later enrolment time for most years. I wouldn't let these things discourage you from taking less courses, they have can be easily overcome with enough planning and having back up plans. In terms of opportunities, no one cared how many classes I took per semester. Best of luck!",comment,3

It’s very manageable compared to 5. I graduated in 4 years with my last term having 3 courses. It will definitely help with your mental health and GPA (I finished with a 3.93/4.0),comment,2
