There is so much suffering in the world that nobody has the capacity to care about everything all at once, especially if it doesn't actually affect their daily lives. Just a reality check. People need to be incentivized to care - through intrinsic or extrinsic rewards - for example, non-palestinians protesting feel a sense of fulfillment because they believe they are helping a moral cause which gives them credibility in their ideological communities. But for the other people who would have cared to the extent of not resisting against the protest or at least being performatively supportive of the cause, they now only view the ordeal as their daily lives being infringed, graduation ceremony ruined, and commutes blocked by angry mobs. Moreover, it's exceptionally easy in this instance because the issue isn't domestic, and even if it was resolved, they wouldn't get any tangible benefits.

I’m sure the protesters appreciate your good intentions too, but I think your confidence in knowing how the world works is too premature here. All of us need to learn more. And we all don’t have to wait till we learn everything to know that we, as a colonizing nation, are never too far from the crime scene of a colonized nation.

It’s like saying “there’s a past serial killer on the loose but we’re very sure the murders happening now aren’t related to them”.

As to the defeatist sentiments in your comment, again I want to assume you have good intentions. But protests are one mechanism in the way a democracy works. Protests (“Deaf President Now”) are how Gallaudet University got their hearing president to resign and their first Deaf president to replace them. Tunisia’s protests got it a change in governance.

And yes, sometimes protests fail. But to hear of calamity and to sit and say: well, odds are it won’t change. That just means you effectively voiced support for the status quo. We are so lucky to witness the energy of passionate university students that have not yet lost hope in the world. We are so lucky to witness those who believe in change. We need a self regulating mechanism, those who question it, as well like yourself. But mind your commentary such that you aren’t actually involving yourself in upholding and defending the status quo",comment,7

I admit it contains a lot of sound arguments. I will say it’s a good riddens situation to lose those that would’ve only been performative supporters, because like you said change requires a long and sustained effort carrying across time. And that just isn’t going to come from performers. We need a concentrated mobilization of effort and concern. Mounting pressure will potentially recruit more on the fringes (who just needed the exposure to the argument that clicks with them or resonates with their world view), but barring that any low quality activism or performative concern isn’t going to free Palestine 😅😆 so I guess all that is to say: sucks for those who will be pissed, but they were never those who were going to bring about the change. It’s going to be those who follow this through to the end, committed to the results they wish to see. 

I am sorry for those impacted by the disruptions, but I’ve also grown bitter of those who think so highly of themselves and their own joy.

However, I (unfortunately) have been debating this for long enough to know for a fact, that many of these people are just eating up propaganda. 

I'm not going to argue that Israel is innocent, however they are absolutely being misrepresented. Typically it goes ""Israel does something shady"" then ""it gets posted without context or with false context"" to make them look as bad as possible.

Then people who don't know any better see it on tic-tok or see it straight from Hamas's news channel, and they parrot it.

You appear to be blaming us for the British's decision, which even taking Canada's position at the time I would be *extremely* generous to call a reach. In fact Canada isn't even mentioned on the wiki page of the document those articles are referencing.

Protests are fine. However you can still execute a protest poorly. I don't see any protests at actual government buildings, you know, where people who actually have any power (let's be real though they don't really have any influence over Isreal) and are instead choosing to protest at schools who are guilty of having *checks notes* a research agreement? What!?

And what completely baffles me is how consistent this is, not just in Canada, they will protest ANYWHERE that isn't a government office. Schools, on Highways/roads, shopping malls, skating rinks, hardware stores.

When I said people don't know how the world works, I mentioned war crimes, rules of war, and military tactics. They also don't know how protests work (or economy but I don't yet know if I'll touch on that in this comment)

So yes it is genocide. They have decimated a significant part of the population. 

Also, putting aside the genocide, let’s go back to 1947-48. There was no Hamas. Between 400-600 Arab villages were destroyed. There was a biological warfare program to POISON WELLS. Almost 300,000 had to leave or be expelled. Israel’s bone to pick is not with Hamas. It’s the presence of Palestinians on the land, and their ongoing ties, which was and remains inconvenient for the creation of an ethnocracy.",comment,2

I would say it’s an interesting position to imply that Canada didn’t have autonomy from Britain at the time. Let me recap to make sure you know the facts on this.

1947: Canada is one of 33 nations to vote in favour of the Partition Plan of Palestine.

1948: Canada granted recognition of the State in Israel…. That’s a validation of the creation of the state. 

1970s: Canada adopts anti-boycott laws in Ontario and Manitoba. 

In response to government offices, yes, they’re great to have there. There’s been plenty of protests at the Israeli consulates! There’s also been plenty of work towards reaching MPs. Mind you many of them have auto response where they’re paying lip service. And are you saying that Canada disagreed or opposed the British position? Canada’s current and former leaders are buddies of Israel, let’s not forget…

Stephen Harper:
“Former prime minister Stephen Harper has made a surprise “solidarity” visit to Israel, meeting top political leaders as well as survivors of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attacks.

“On Monday, the long-time vocal supporter [Stephen Harper] of the Jewish state visited two stricken kibbutzim, Nir-Oz and B’eri, and the site of the Nova festival massacre. He spoke to survivors of “unspeakable atrocities,” he said on the X social media site.” 

This is recent (2024).

CTV news headline with Trudeau recently: “Trudeau affirms support for Israel in call with war cabinet member Benny Gantz” 

None of this is a conspiracy. If Canadians want to be fully open to Truth and Reconciliation, locally and globally, we need to acknowledge our role and not act like we lack power. We’re top 30 in military power in the world…",comment,1

We were still kind of working on our true independence at that point. For the others, would voting against it have been a better solution? I'm not going to pretend to have an answer for that. There was a shit tonne of displaced jews, and Britain was finishing up dismantling their empire. They had some spare land left, and wanted to do something with it.

As for the people who are actually going to MPs and protesting at the embassy (even if they get met with the same response all our MPs give about any of the myriad of issues our country is currently facing), even if I disagree with them, good, their doing it the way its supposed to be done. 

Stephan harper is retired. I don't really care what he does. Trudeau however basically has to support Israel. Israel's society values are a little behind, (by like, 10-20 years) but they pretty closely align with western societal values, such as not executing gay people for example, and their overall stance on things is pretty hard to find in the middle east.

Now I've been defending Israel a lot so I want to clarify my position.

Israel is conducting a war in a populated urban enviroment, against an enemy who's ""uniform"" is civilian clothing, that hides amongst a civilian population. This is an unenviable position. I would even say that not even the USA could conduct a clean war under these circumstances even if they tried.

I do not believe they are executing a genocide, I do not believe they are committing an abnormal amount of war crimes (which is important, there will always be accidents in war) beyond what could be expected given the operating environment.

With that disclaimer out of the way, I believe Israel operates under the branch of ""technically correct""

They aren't doing anything ""technically wrong"" but they absolutely are doing things that they could, if they wanted to, do better. (The current agreement regarding ownership of water in the west Bank for example.) Making this worse is propaganda. Showcasing these instances, and then removing the context or making false context to make them look as bad as possible.

Now I absolutely believe this makes them the lesser of two evils. I've seen the videos Hamas proudly uploaded of Oct 7th, and I know of all the horrible shit they've done in the past. I see their refusal of reasonable terms (given what started this war I'm amazed Israel would accept anything other then unconditional surrender), and I see the laughable excuse of what Hamas considers reasonable terms while they are responsible for the death of thousands of their own people, which they per an interview with vice a couple years ago, don't even care about.

Israel absolutely can be better, but they are in an awful position, and Hamas as proven that it needs to be exterminated.

I wish Palestinians were led by a government that cared about them.",comment,3

Not just Muslims but also Christians, too. Do you think it was a coincidence that both in 2014 and in 2024, there were only 2 casulties of rockets being fired at Israel, and they were both ""Arabs,"" meaning Palestinians? Why? Oh, that's right. The government doesn't protect them with bomb shelters. That's only reserved for Jewish settlements and towns and cities. Not Arabs. Despite both communities that experienced causulties asking for it. The mother of the 10 year old girl blamed apartheid in Israel for her child's condition. 


But that's just one area. In so-called ""Israel,"" 2 million Palestinans live as citizens. But guess what? They account for 90% of home demolition risks and permits. Why? They do this so that they can get rid of them and build Jewish settlements just like they do in WB. 

The Palestinians also can not purchase land or homes in Jewish towns due to a law that allows people to discriminate. As a result, it's very much segregated with the Palestinians getting the short end of stick when it comes to services like schools, Healthcare and etc. Because a lot Jewish people don't become doctors or work in Healthcare, and because Palestinians emphasize studying and education, 65% of doctors are Palestinians in so-called Israel, and yet their communities are undeserved when it comes to Healthcare due to discrimination and segregation. 

Lastly, so-called Israel openly admits its an apartheid state because it's a state not for all its citizens but only for the Jewish people. They were that way since its inception.",comment,-3

I don't necessarily disagree with you but the way you phrased this is also disingenous lol, like how are you going to make a claim to critize how the Palestinian protest is for people on the other side of the planet and not even mention the same thing for people protesting about HK, like either acknowledge that point for both sides or don't make that argument at all. 


It's also weird to talk about how one side is about democratic freedoms and not mention how the student group protesting is also AT THE VERY LEAST doing what they think is supporting human rights in the world while also getting their university to stop associating with the country they think is violating those rights (not saying what they are doing is effective but the way you painted the two sides is very skewed and unnecessarily biased imo).",comment,2

the context in which they respond to. colonized people can be equally “brutal” toward their colonizers; that is not illegitimate violence just bc it’s wielded against white Europeans (bc that’s what they are. “americans” are immigrants.) 

and exterminating themselves??? “extermination” is a word of genocide. people will not exterminate themselves but they will also not be exterminated by someone else. relationships between “indigenous tribes” are the same as any society because competition over resources and, now, neoliberalism and big bad capitalism, stratifies society. ofc people would be violent toward chauvinistic foreigners destroying the extant sociopolitical and ecological order. but please, go ahead and tell me that indigenous peoples exterminate themselves because they are uncivilized degenerates incapable of even fathoming such complex societies. i can give you links to or pdfs of scholarly works about this if you’re interested. 

and who’s we??? where’s your civil war uniform??? bayonet??? what’s your age-defying skincare routine??? you didn’t do anything. you are stretching one version of the historical “truth” into general statements that purposefully obscures context, without which render “arguments” vague, unproven, and, generally, useless. actually, maybe it is “we” for you because those are your ancestors whose descendants are clearly still whining about losing their “privilege” to conquer anything and anyone. 

give me your sources and i’ll leave. specify “indigenous tribes”. give the context in which indigenous peoples were killing each other. substantiate your argument. simply stating your opinion and justifying it with “just because” or “well i think it’s xyz” is not an argument; save that for your journal. prove me wrong with contextualized, historicized facts weighed against other similar works to corroborate that your statements do, indeed, explain patterns across space and time succinctly.",comment,1
