Is it normal for a TA position to be retracted due to CUPE agreement favoring PhD students?,InternationalYouth78,1gfpt8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gfpt8u/is_it_normal_for_a_ta_position_to_be_retracted/,1730303499.0,"Hello everyone,

I am a master's student in an engineering department, and a professor emailed me about a TA appointment. However, just a few hours after receiving it, I received another email from the professor stating that the department must adhere to the CUPE agreement, and the position can only be offered to a PhD student. Is this a normal?",submission,31

Unless you received a formal offer, this sounds less like a retraction and more that they were eager but didn't check the policies or earmarks. There may have been a subsequent appointment already in place, for example, or the unit may have otherwise needed to meet funding package quotas etc. ",comment,46

PhD students are supposed to be guaranteed a certain number of hours of TAships - we have to work that amount to make up our base funding. In departments with research based MAs the same applies to masters students but if it’s not part of their funding package then they won’t get priority.

I understand your annoyance but PhD students have to fight for our entitled hours even with union laws — that’s where the majority of our income comes from. If they were able to give them out discretionally we would starve.",comment,2

My department probably only gives 10% of funding as TA, so we do things differently. (We are also guaranteed only 60 hours per semester). But I believe that research based master's also get guarantees, so it doesn't make sense to always prioritize the phd student over the master's student for every single course. OP is in engineering and I'm not in that department so I don't know if they are research or course-based, but if they are guaranteed they are equally entitled to those hours. 

The only time I was annoyed at this rule, was when I was hiring TAs and had to give a reason for not hiring every single unqualified PhD student before master's and undergrads who actually knew the course. 

Besides, it is pretty bad to retract offers. Maybe the professor didn't know - I certainly didn't know when I was teaching and no onboarding materials were given to me.",comment,1

I know there is also the union requirement of “past experience preferred” and the category of “pursuing PhD in subject”, both of which restrict hiring. As a MA student in a non-TAing dept, one of the other depts wanted to hire me but could only do so after two different PhD students had accepted and then backed out of the contract (with good reason, the instructor was horrible) - then it went out as an external emergency posting and I got it that way.

In our dept we have ZERO control over who is hired as the TA as grad course instructors. Even profs can only indicate preference but often don’t get the person they request. These various union rules need to be better publicized. Like you I got no on-boarding when i started teaching, and it’s a real problem.",comment,1
