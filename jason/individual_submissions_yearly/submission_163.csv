How do I get out of a friendship that I don't want,Business_Ad_858,1faplsq,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1faplsq/how_do_i_get_out_of_a_friendship_that_i_dont_want/,1725655665.0,"Hello. I'm a first-year student, and there's a girl in my class who thinks I’m her best friend. I know everything about her because she never stops talking about herself. She even told me how badly she did in her first high school exam. Honestly, I didn’t ask, and I don’t care. But she knows nothing about me since I never get the chance to interrupt her monologue. She constantly complains about how miserable and stupid she is (her exact words). She follows me to lunch, to coffee, and to our next class. Since she sits next to me in the afternoon class, she often asks me, ""Do you understand this?"" or ""What did the prof say?"" while I’m trying to concentrate, and sometimes she just copies my notes without asking. During the group discussion with my friends, I felt sorry to exclude her, but when I invited her to join the conversation, she remained silent.

What can I do without hurting her? She’s a nice person, and I don’t want to sound selfish, but I want some privacy and I really can’t handle all the negative energy as I’m trying to adjust to uni courses.",submission,161

Second, she must realize that you are not her tutor or teaching assistant. So a nice way is ""I don't know the answer, but post it on Piazza."" or ""I think the prof has office hours tomorrow."".

Make yourself busy with your own activities (eg. sports), work and actual friends. Also, perhaps try to find a different sitting where you have strangers on your left and right or better your actual friends or meet other people in the class and keep yourself busy talking with them.

Keep conversations short and be discreet about your activities, saying ""I am busy with some stuff"". Avoid asking her any questions, that will just open more conversations. 

Be honest about wanting to work on your worn e.g. ""sorry I just need to read through this on my own."".",comment,4

I'll just share a few phrases if you need help with the words themselves.
""Since we spend so much time together, I don't get to talk to new people. I would prefer if we only hung out during xyz time""
""I don't feel comfortable talking about xyz"" 
""If you talk to me right now I won't be able to pay attention to the professor"" 


About the notes thing: that's pretty normal in uni. Even people who I never spoke to will glace sideways at my page if they missed what the professor said. If she isn't interfering with your note-taking, ignore it. 

If she is preventing you from being to access your notes, ie sliding them over to her spot or blocking your view with her head, then you are well within your rights to cover them with your hand, give her a dirty look and tell her to not touch/block your stuff.",comment,2

While talking it out and being honest is polite, this is university, there are thousands of kids, and just cutting ties with people is pretty easy.

I had a friend like yours in my first year as well, very clingy, follows me everywhere, annoying, and worst of all, tried to sabotage my education (shes a ""gunner""). I just made small changes to my usual routine, by hanging out with my other group of friends, sitting with my other group of friends in class. It wasn't abrupt, but we saw each other less frequently and by second semester, I never saw her again.

Sometimes, you gotta put yourself first, and get out of a toxic relationship, otherwise you will suffer for years. You will meet many people during your time here, and many more will leave your life as quickly as they came into it. Surround yourself with positive people",comment,1

If this is your case and you want some untraditional options, you can also: 
-Tell her a family member passed away and you want space and slowly ghost her
-Tell her you’re going through medical issues and need time to adjust
-Avoid her until she gets the hint
-Be completely boring and disengaging

If she wants to hang out, tell her you have plans with someone else. If she insists on coming with, start setting your boundaries and say “no, I’m meeting them one on one”.

I had a couple people I initially bonded with during orientation but once I got into my own schedule I just didn’t have the time or energy, so I made a conscious effort to sit in different spots and talk to different people. Nothing wrong with shifting focus and letting them figure it out on their own, especially when they seem as pushy as the one OP is dealing with",comment,1

The longer you go expecting an ignorant person to take a hint, the longer you’ll have this energy drain in your life.

Just be clear upfront and polite. Done and dusted.",comment,28

You have to stand up for yourself so that ""she asked why would I do that, and she wanted to join me""- I know it can be hard.  But you just have to have an answer to it.  It's easy: you can make something up or tell the truth, which for me is:  ""I'm tired after listening all through class (or whatever), and I need some time to eat quietly by myself to recharge.  Sometimes I need to be away from other people's energy for awhile and to sit by myself.""  -  At the end of the day, ""No, Sorry""  IS also an answer.  It is not your responsibility to keep her happy or entertained.  I know its hard to say tho, I do get it.  It sucks but we have to stand up for ourselves and our boundaries, our own happiness and well-being, at the end of the day.  ""I hate to be blunt, but I guess that's the only way."" - Exactly, you've got it.",comment,4

She might be using you as a crutch and as an excuse to be social. I know you mentioned that all she does is talk about herself to you, but you have been kind enough to listen, so good for you, you're a good person already. Good luck!",comment,9

Ask about that, ask what they do also. It’s important to find common grounds. Can also join clubs or whatever so you get to meet consistently. Have you tried being the one to make plans? I often find it’s easier to make plans in person also. 

In the end you gotta recognize that not everyone matches your energy or is interested. Just keep talking to people, listen(important) and show interest. People like talking about themselves so keep asking questions. Ask if they wanna get lunch or whatever also

If you talk to someone long enough consistently you become friends pretty much. To reach that stage though you gotta find things to talk about, and try to make the conversations interesting and fun. 

Good relationships rarely happen overnight, it takes time for people to open up so keep at it, keep asking to hang out",comment,1
