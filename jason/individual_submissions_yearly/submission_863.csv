I've been at UofT for three semesters now, and every semester my exams are always in the worst possible studying order. My absolute first exam on one of the first days of the exam period is always a math or computer science course. MAT135 was literally on day 2 at 9am sharp this semester. CSC108/CSC148 were both at 9 in the damn morning too. 

Next up is BIO120, also at 9am (STEM loves to punish night owls evidently) 

The courses I have the easiest time studying for are always dead last. SLA100/SLA101 (language courses), LIN101/LIN102/LIN228 and PSY100 were all near the end of the exam period, all fell later in the day.

This is UofT we're talking about, so I wouldn't be surprised if they purposely scheduled the most difficult and competitive courses earliest for ""prestige"" or ""weeding out"" or some other bs. But I'm curious if there's some logic or reasonable explanation.",submission,18

(In general, because instructors want marks to be in before the next semester starts, more of them are working during winter break than you would expect.)

Large courses w/ multiple-choice exams are quickly graded and so there's less scheduling pressure.",comment,36

They do, however, take preferences/ considerations into account wherever and whenever they can. And it could be that professors teaching those courses may have asked for the exam to be early/ late for many reasons. Some could be projecting and think it's better to have a difficult exam early and ""out if the way"" so the exam fatigue is not there yet.",comment,1
