I heard the food is mediocre, bathrooms are dirty, and the AC/heating system is terrible so I am lowk regretting choosing it. I did hear that Morrison Hall has the good stuff, but I'm worried that I might not be placed into that selection. **I just want to know how to prepare myself if I do move in and how I can make friends and have a good first year as a science student.**",submission,18

Lived there all 4 years (mostly Whitney, Morrison final year). You have a good chance of meeting people who will be important for the rest of your life - spouses, best friends. Met my wife there. Yeah no AC in older buildings, but windows and ceiling fans will get you by. I lived there in the summer a couple times and survived. People complaining about the small stuff are missing the big picture - you get to live in the centre of campus with other people your age experiencing true independence for the first time. Donâ€™t blow it by staying in your room all the time.",comment,29

She wanted Morrison but was glad in the end she didnâ€™t get it. She says Whitney is the best. And UC is the best. You made a great choice donâ€™t worry.,comment,9

I've been living for three years straight in the same room at Sir Daniel Wilson, and I don't regret it one bit. The food is pretty aight, it's nothing top shelf it's literally dining hall food, you get what you pay for. Heating ain't bad, there's no cooling tho. The community building you find at sir dans is quite amazing too. I'm returning there for my fourth year, hoping to get the same room overlooking the quad. I think staying in UC was one of my best decisions",comment,7

And there is a large kitchen right next to it. Eating in the dining hall wasnâ€™t bad and also a chance to be together and socialize. But sometimes they would make meals together. Make sure you buy the smallest meal plan. You can always top up if needed but leftover meal plan dollars donâ€™t roll over. Meal plan is required.,comment,4

The dining hall food is alright, and UC is at a central enough location that you have easy access to a lot of food options. You need to pay for the meal plan with your residence fees anyways so why would you want to waste money you already paid by not going to the dining hall?",comment,2

It felt like I was wasting money to buy my own ingredients when I knew I had cash sitting in my account for the dining hall.",comment,2

You canâ€™t use it for any other establishments on campus.,comment,1
