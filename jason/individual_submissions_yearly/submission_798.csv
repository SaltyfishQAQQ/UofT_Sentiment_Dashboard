to incoming first year math/cs students: register for PUMP II,NotAName320,1d7mdsu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d7mdsu/to_incoming_first_year_mathcs_students_register/,1717467964.0,"PUMP II is a very underrated summer math course available to incoming first year students. it goes over all the basics of proofs which will really help for those preparing to take MAT137, MAT157, or CSC165. there are actual TAs grading the problem sets and tests you do as well, so you get a taste of how to write things that TAs are looking for. if you're looking for something to do to prepare for UofT during summer, i heavily recommend this course since it really helped me through my first year.

you can register for it here: https://sidneysmithcommons.artsci.utoronto.ca/arriveready/learning-modules/",submission,21

I personally took 135/136 in first year, but decided to enrol in PUMPII, because I was on the fence about 137. The basic ideas of the course helped me a lot in my calc courses, and especially in linear algebra I. I'm self-teaching myself 137 over this summer, and (even a year later!) the PUMPII material is a huge crutch when learning formal proof writing.

It's free, it's serious, and, it works! Please take PUMP II.",comment,3
