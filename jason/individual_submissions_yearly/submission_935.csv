I will have a part-time job but I will still have lots of free time. I am looking for things to do outside of the house. I am not going to take any summer courses. Do you have any suggestions? Are student clubs running during the summer? Are there workshops/small courses for students somewhere on campus? Thanks! ",submission,15

I think some clubs definitely run through summer, but the only ones I'm aware of are engineering design clubs (fase, autoronto, etc).",comment,2
