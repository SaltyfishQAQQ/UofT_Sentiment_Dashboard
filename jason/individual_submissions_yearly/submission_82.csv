It’s really expensive major if you guys know. I’ve gotten a job lined up after that but I recently got laid off due to overstaffing. I tried looking for other jobs but I’m still searching. I haven’t found anything despite getting interviews. I’ve even started applying for minimum wage jobs, haven’t had any luck. I’m aware the job market is terrible currently and I’m behind on rent. I think I’m going to have to sell my car but the only way I make money is doing Uber but it’s not enough. I sent my portfolio to a million different places probably and no replies. I wouldn’t even mind a commission only job. I called my parents back home and told them everything is going okay when it’s not. In a few months or so I’ll be homeless I think. I might have to move back to my country if I don’t find a job sooner or later. I’m not sure what to do.

Edit: weird how some people are assuming I’m Indian when I’m actually from Azerbaijan lol",submission,275

As for your car if you sell it you would be limited in terms of where you can travel for work and the car could give you a place to sleep if you can't afford rent. So might be good to save selling it as a last resort.

Perhaps you could expand to beyond Toronto or consider moving outside of Toronto? 

It mught be good to find a good temp agency also to help with your job search.

Now we are just revenue streams to the big retail banks (student lines/LOCs) , tuition fees for the universities, and cheap labour to the corporate world. The only way to make it in this fucked up country is to join the Ponzi scheme of buying a house as quickly as possible - which in and of itself is an utter pipe dream for the average gen Z person. You cant even turn to social assistance in this country without facing a glut of administrative knobs who serve no purpose but to shuffle you around, while answering 2 or 3 emails all day. We have some seriously deep rooted issues in this country and a lot of them require significant dialogue that many young Canadians are not  mature enough to have.

There are still some options that you can look into to help you.

Rent bank toronto provides grants for those falling behind on rent. They may or may not be able to assist you with utilities as well

There are also food banks located nearby that can help you

  
Have you looked into applying for TA ships or RA positions in the different universities located around the GTA? It might also help strengthen your application as you apply for graduate school!

Second, it is commendable that you have taken up on yourself to find employment before pursuing masters realising the financial constraints.

Third, it is true that job market is tough anytime.. but as an uoft grad, you will always have a better chance to crack it then the next person .

Fourth, there is no need to fight the battle alone, open up to your family/parents, it will take some unnecessary pressure off immediately. Reach out to peers, professors, seniors for leads. Try offering tuitions to high school students while the job search is on. Expand your horizons, look beyond the city, province , country..

It is not always as bad as it seems! Take days one by one, try to do something positive each day, things will automatically improve!

Always believe in yourself!",comment,3
