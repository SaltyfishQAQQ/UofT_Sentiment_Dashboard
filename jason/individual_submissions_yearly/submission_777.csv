Anyone know why the Fall term is starting earlier and ending later than last year?,freshwaterwalrus,1f5ombc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f5ombc/anyone_know_why_the_fall_term_is_starting_earlier/,1725114674.0,"Based on the Engineering academic calendar: Classes begin on Tues, Sep 3 vs Thurs, Sep 7 last year (traditionally, engineering always began on the Thurs after labor day). Exam period ends on the Dec 23rd vs 20th last year. Winter term starts on the Jan 6 vs Jan 8 last year.

I get that part of this is based on the days of week, but it seems odd that they would increase the length of the term by 7 days and also shorten the winter break.",submission,22
