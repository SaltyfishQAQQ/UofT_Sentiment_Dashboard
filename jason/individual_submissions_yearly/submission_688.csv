"Wasted $70,000 yearly tuition and one year computer science",usef468,1fzcryn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fzcryn/wasted_70000_yearly_tuition_and_one_year_computer/,1728427319.0,"I know an international student who is registered in UTM’s first year computer science, but they are taking all the out of stream UTSG CS courses to get into the program in downtown. I told them that they are wasting one year and a lot of money because it’s not possible to apply to a UTSG Post while being a UTM student (they would need to transfer first then take the courses). Even then, getting in is difficult.

Just wanted to ask if what they are doing is even possible because to my limited knowledge on CS post, it’s not possible.",submission,27
