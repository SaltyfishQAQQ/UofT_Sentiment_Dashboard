Chestnut Residence: Trade agreement Pastries for Mentorship,emxss,1el2ksd,https://i.redd.it/mg91ezdmjxgd1.jpeg,1722900456.0,"I stayed at Chestnut two years ago and love their pain au chocolat pastry (photo attached). I am now living off campus but am craving the dessert. 

I’m seeking a Chestnut resident who is willing to bring me some of these pastries. They are available in the mornings around 2-3x a week. 

In return I am willing to mentor you as an upper year engineering student interning at a F500 company. I can give advice on coursework, exams, school life, and resume review.

Why this benefits you:
- most people do not finish their meal plan anyway 
- can give lots of good advice for the low cost of a pain au chocolat 

Thanks :) ",submission,83

I was not a Chestnut resident, but the pastries sold at my residence (Trinity) tasted very similar to 711's pastries. I've never had their pain au chocolat, but it might be worth a try.",comment,6
