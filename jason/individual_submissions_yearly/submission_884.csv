(also if people could please provide insight on how to make friends more easily it would really help‚Ä¶i literally dont have any friends so i cant judge if this is ‚Äúmaking a friend‚Äù or just being friendly partners in tutorial",submission,17

Also alot of them cosplay as bears üêª and have bunk beds because they are asking if I'm a top or bottom. I was on the bottom bunk as a kid so I say bottom and they send me a smiley face.",comment,1
