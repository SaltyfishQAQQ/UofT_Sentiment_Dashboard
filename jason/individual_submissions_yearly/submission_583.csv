You need a PhD to be a tenure-track professor and the ones you see doing well and making pretty good money, are in the top institutions in their field. If you do get tenure and you are still doing well w.r.t publishing and other associated things, then you can have a really good time. However, you will make no money in your 20s and some of your 30s. There are multiple points of failure. 

50% of students who enter a PhD do not graduate with one. Of those who graduate, less than 20% find a tenure-track research position. Of those, less than 5% are in the top ranked departments in their field with a good salary, benefits and other setup.",comment,123

Profs here are some of the best in their field. Not every university will have the same benefits (and funding) as they do here. There are so many PhDs who are in adjunct positions and post docs barely making ends meet. There’s the added issue of having very little agency in where you end up, tenure track positions are rare and you may not get to choose where you want to work. 

With all if that being said, if you get tenure at a well respected institution, and you’re in a field that you enjoy and has good funding opportunities, then yeah it may be a very good life after that.",comment,24

Profs have always made good money. It’s always been financially viable. Lately I’d argue it’s less so given that 100k doesn’t go as far as it used to, but it’s still pretty damn good. What isn’t viable is the ability to become one. If you truly are committed to being a prof, enjoy working for under 50k a year until you’re 35, because thats what it is these days. I’d honestly bet that 65-75% of “profs” for undergrad classes are just course instructors, these days, all PhD students whose best funding package still places them in financial insecurity.

Speaking as somebody who was very very…very naive before I went to get my masters, a career in academia is possible, but rare, and relies far more on luck and who you know rather than merit. If you do get in, you’re chilling, but always plan alternative career options.",comment,2

I finished my PhD pretty recently and my lab was pretty prolific at placing graduates into faculty positions either directly out of their PhD or shortly after a postdoc. 

I had two labmates in particular that were model researchers. Their output was absolutely insane (e.g., they published like 4x more than the average *good* PhD student) and they won paper awards at conferences, departmental awards, and school-wide awards. In short, they are both really brilliant researchers who have set my mental bar for what a fantastic PhD student is. 

Both of them managed to find faculty positions at *good* schools, but neither is at a super elite school. These guys were probably the best PhD students in a cohort of a department that ranks top 10 in the US in our field. They probably *could* have been placed at an elite school if circumstances aligned for them, but the point is that not even these guys are guaranteed the top-of-the-top positions and the rest of us humans have to compete with these guys for just the *good* positions. For comparison, I had other labmates who went into academia that weren't quite as prolific, but were definitely *good* PhD students. They're currently at what you would probably consider a mediocre university in the US.

The kicker is that I was a pretty average PhD student in comparison. I never had designs for academia and I got an industry research position after graduating. I'm currently making more than either of these guys. They're obviously not doing it for the salary, but that's just how academia vs. industry works in STEM.",comment,43

However, there is an interesting complication to this. Many savvy professors, especially in STEM fields make a lot more than their industry counterparts (through a combination of salary and consulting) and can create an excellent quality of life for themselves by leveraging their career social capitals in way that is hard to do for an industry person.

But yes, I completely agree with you. I would think that just about *everyone* (aside from the uni admin) would be happier if there were more teaching Profs (who are not paid peanuts) and the teaching load of research Profs was reduced significantly.

For more context, I think the idea of having Profs teach isn't necessarily a bad one. But the problems arise because their incentives are all out-of-wack. Profs don't get promotions, research grants, and prestigious external career awards based on the quality of their teaching. Their job security and growth is pretty much entirely dictated by their research. Of course, they can get into trouble if they're *really* bad at teaching, and they can get ""bonus points"" if they're really good at teaching.  But ultimately the main thing that matters is their research.

You can make an argument that any effort put into teaching beyond the bare minimum is actively detrimental to the career of a Prof (from the perspective of min-maxxing).  Of course, there are lots of a Profs that put a tonne of effort into their teaching despite this because they're passionate about it and they have a strong sense of responsibility. But you begin to understand why so many Profs neglect their teaching responsibilities when you view things from this lens. I still think that Profs have the responsibility to do more than the bare minimum, but the reason that this system often doesn't work is that it's entirely built upon the altruism of individual Profs.",comment,2

Research is what gives universities their prestige and brings in funding. School rankings are often based on research output too. And a PhD is essentially a researcher training program and all tenure track professors will have PhDs. Most professors (would like to) have their focus first and foremost be on their research program. Professors run their labs and “hire” graduate students to carry out research and when these students publish work, some of that credit is attributed to that prof. The more a prof can publish and the more prestigious journals they publish in is an indicator of success and will help them when applying for grants and tenure. Since this is what makes the university money and increases ranking, this is also the university’s priority. Hiring people to solely teach requires the university to pay them but because they will have very minimal research output, will not help the university in their primary goal.

Teaching is usually a professor’s second focus, at best. So that’s why teaching quality is hit or miss. Of course, there are profs who care deeply about teaching but at the end of the day research gives them money, prestige, and a job.",comment,4
