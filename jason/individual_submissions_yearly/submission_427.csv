Why are you spending 30+ mins on the same machine in the gym,Tiakitty967,1fmvi15,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fmvi15/why_are_you_spending_30_mins_on_the_same_machine/,1727017799.0,"When I show up to the gym, I‚Äôm not trying to spend a crazy amount of time there, I‚Äôm working out and leaving pretty much. I lift as heavy as I can without hurting myself and when I can‚Äôt do that I go and hit a last little bit on the cables at light weight. Usually after hitting heavier weight I get to the point of failure pretty quick, like less than 10 minutes.

What the heck is up with you guys that will spend like 30 mins + on those standing cable machines though. Last few times I‚Äôve been I‚Äôve seen people staying on them for so long repping super light weight for longer than it takes me to do an entire workout. Like what‚Äôs the point guys? üò≠ ",submission,56

I can 109% guarantee op lifts too heavy and a ""light weight"" workout with correct form would kill them. 

Don't shame people over weight amounts

some peoples programs based upon goals, sports etc require it. If its a good back day with lat focus its 60 mins on cables for me

Lastly you're cable portion is likely junk volume

But also most people have no plan or idea what they are doing. If you are a serious lifter youll drop the 20$ on a hone membership and be able to lift in your needed time requirement.

Common op your a uoft student problem solve 

Also given your post history i think 30 mins on a cardio machine may be essential for ya üòâ",comment,13
