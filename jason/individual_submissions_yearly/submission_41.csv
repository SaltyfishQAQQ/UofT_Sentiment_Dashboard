Doing that would not, however, give the parties or Intervenors the sense that they have been heard and would make a peaceful resolution less likely. I have therefore taken the additional time to address the arguments of both sides in greater detail and have tried to write these reasons in a way that is understandable to the many non-lawyers who are interested in the outcome of this case.""

Took the time to read the whole decision. Pretty fair and measured explanation where he goes to great pains to explain and be clear every step of the way. As he notes at the beginning, he didn't have to do that. 

tl;dr - judge found evidence around antisemitism and violence unconvincing and plagued by hearsay, but that protesters can't just take over property by force + there is nothing stopping them from protesting sans tents 7am-11pm daily + if they weren't restricting access to front campus to other groups (or even people wanting to eat their breakfast) then he would have a harder time giving the injunction.

The judge said there wasn't prima facie (""on its face"", roughly) evidence that the language used by protestors, as described in the university filing, was bigoted enough for an injunction on its own.

You're correct in your assessment here, and that's basically what the judge ruled.

Although there is public ACCESS to front campus, it is not a public property. Therefore, it is not bound by the Charter (the charter only applies in relation to the government, not private entities). 

The occupiers said that the Charter did apply, and in order to limit the free expression of occupiers, the university had to prove that it was reasonable to do so. Section 2 of the Charter discusses free expression, and Section 1 discusses the reasonable limits.

UofT basically made the argument that:

1. If the Charter doesn't apply, then its our land and we want it bad;  
2. If the Charter does apply, it is still reasonable to limit their speech because it is causing reputational harm.",comment,29

>The overall goal of the protesters is to get the University to divest from certain investments. The  University has procedures in place to consider those sorts of requests.

They have succeeded in catching everyone’s attention and in obtaining an expedited process.** It is now time for the protesters to peacefully dismantle the encampment and focus their energies on building support within the group that will investigate divestment and within the broader University community to persuade both groups that divestment is a worthy goal. Persuasion will not be achieved through occupation but through reasoned discussion.

Okay, so they _did_ submit evidence that did not link specific members of the encampment. UofT lawyers would not argue ""irreparable harm"" and not bring _any_ evidence. So what gives? The point still stands that the judge found no evidence of ""antisemitic intentions"" in the encampment.


If you want to argue that antisemitism exists in Toronto, go for it. It does. It's just weird that you are trying to ""no, actually"" a literal quote of the judge saying they did not find any link between the encampment and antisemitism.",comment,7
