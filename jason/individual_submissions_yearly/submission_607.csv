Either way, I would highly encourage you to go to frosh week as it's a great opportunity to meet new people and possibly form life long friendships.

I do have a special fondness for New College (was a leader for all years I was there) so I hope you have an amazing time if you decide to go! And consider becoming a leader once you're in 2nd year+. Personally, I met more people when I was a leader, had more fun and genuinely enjoyed guiding new students through their years in undergrad with tips and life advice (for the ones that kept in touch).",comment,1

I am a new college second year student who did not go to orientation. To be very honest with you I think not going to orientation was the biggest reason why I had no friends for at least the first month of uni.

You don't really have to go if you can't afford it, this is just ONE opportunity to make friends, you will have loads and loads of opportunities later on. 

  
As far as I am aware you pay some $$ to cover meals, t-shirts, and perhaps pay the organizers/staff, but it's not mandatory given that you've already paid $$$ tuition to come to UoT. So you will not deeply regret not going.",comment,18
