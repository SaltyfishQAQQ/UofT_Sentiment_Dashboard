I didn't stick around long enough to see what exactly they were doing, but same thing happened to York a few months ago, and they were apparently trying to sell monitors they bought off temu for like $400 each to gullible students, so yeah keep an eye out if you want to waste your money for no reason at all

They were just like ""This is going to sound super weird, but we just did a installation job for uoft, we were suppose to only do 3 TVs, but they gave us 5. Do you want to buy this one off of us? I'll give it to you discounted."" 

 They had a clip board with a invoice or some sort of documentation, but I didn't really give it a look. I politely declined and I remember them mentioning that they had already sold one already. They were kinda pushy, but I just continued to decline and wished them well.",comment,5
