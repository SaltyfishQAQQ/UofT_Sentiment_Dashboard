Basically the title. I’m also especially interested in hearing from international students who aren’t from a Western country that studied in Canada but ended up not staying after the completion of their degree (or are planning on not staying). Why didn’t you stay/aren’t you staying? What did you do after you left—return home to work? Took a break? Travel? Move elsewhere? What are you doing now? If you’re studying in Canada rn but aren’t planning on staying, what’s your plan? I’m just curious to hear your path.⭐️

The graduating class of 2021 faced significant challenges because our PGWPs all expired in 2024. In contrast, those with PGWPs expiring in 2021, 2022, or 2023 benefited from an 18-month extension under a special COVID-19 policy aimed at addressing labour shortages.

This policy allowed anyone who graduated between 2018 and 2022, with a 1- to 3-year PGWP that expired on or before December 31, 2023, to qualify for the extension. While the measure was intended to help, it made the Express Entry pool extremely competitive. Additionally, between 2018 and 2023, there was a surge in students graduating from diploma mills. Since the CRS in the EE program doesn’t differentiate much between legitimate bachelor’s degrees and diploma holders, this influx further crowded the pool.

Many of these diploma programs were only 1 or 2 years long, yet still awarded 1- to 3-year PGWPs. This allowed most graduates from such institutions to qualify for the 18-month extension, further increasing competition.

The government also proceeded to introduce category draws for those who were fluent in French and for those who worked in health care, this further ate up the already limited number of PR spots. There was also a surge in LMIA scams among diploma mill graduates since an LMIA-supported closed work provided 50 additional points. All of this has massively inflated the draw cut-offs.

The system is a mess right now. The government has taken steps to address it including imposing study permit caps, introducing more stringent requirements to qualify for PGWPs and even eliminating the points for LMIA-supported closed work permits but it will take a few years for these changes to trickle down and for the scores in the pool to level off.

To answer your question, I majored in a finance and economics specialist program and have been working in management consulting since I graduated.

Thank you! Fingers crossed I do get it soon.

Best of luck!",comment,19

I appreciate you sharing! Same on not wanting to leave here with just the degree. My program is in Psychology but I’m not sure I want to go further with the field. I’m currently very interested in public health research (broadly), so hoping to get more qualitative and mixed-methods research next year, before embarking on an MPH (tentatively) in 2025.",comment,1

I don't wear T-shirts here. Even in July and August I wear long sleeve shirts outdoors. I put my coat on in early October, and wouldn't take it off until April.

The days are sunny statistically, but they are too short in the winter. The high latitude of Toronto (compared to Asia, I know the latitudes of European cities are crazy) makes the sunlight less direct and warm. If the sunlight is not hot it isn't really sunny.",comment,1
