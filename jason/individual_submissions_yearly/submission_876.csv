I was wondering what UofT STEM students are currently using to take notes.

For handwritten notes, I was wondering if you use: **Classic pen and paper** or **A tablet/2-in-1 device**

I would love to hear your experiences! Thank you in advanced.

**Update December 2024:**  
For those seeing this post in the future, just wanted to give my experience taking digital notes after my first semester in statistics.  
**TL;DR**: I now prefer writing math notes and doing practice sets on paper but occasionally use a tablet for written assignments. I feel more productive and focused with paper.

At the start of the semester, I used a tablet exclusively for notes and practice problems. While it was enjoyable, I noticed after around five weeks that my productivity dropped, and my grades reflected it. Gradually, I switched back to paper and found myself more engaged and efficient. By the end of the semester, most of my notes and practice sets were on paper, while only written assignments remained digital. (referring to math courses.)

Paper notes were easier to review, and the process felt more natural. That said, my preference may have been influenced by my budget tablet's performance, my existing familiarity with writing on paper, or my increased interest in the course work as time progressed. Your experience can be much different, so take my words lightly :)",submission,17

This is the approach that a lot of the math grad students, postdocs, and faculty use if they have online teaching and online meetings, fwiw.

Another option is to go fully native and have no laptop and have everything on your tablet, impeccably organized.  Using both technologies means you've got to be quite organized about transferring/synchronizing files and that's easy to get behind on.",comment,1

I'm pretty sure that you learn more by writing things down manually, as long as you can keep up.  I don't think its possible to keep up with class by using a notebook to type your notes, plus math/stem classes use lots of mathematics notation/graphs etc, which are hard to type.  I guess there's Latex, but that is even slower, unless there's a better frontend for it nowadays.  I think that I would use all 3:  Pen and paper, iPad and a laptop, for different things.  At least the ipad is good for pdf textbook reading, etc.  I studied Computer Science so I had to have a laptop, and I found the iPads useful, but not so much for notetaking.  They have improved so much now, that I would have probably used an iPad for my notes with the newer models with the much improved pens/pen handling.  You should always have pen and paper with you anyway, since you may have a dead battery or something anyway.  Spiral notebooks are useful to have.  The trick with lectures is keeping up/ahead of what they are doing so that you can predict what will happen next, so whatever lets you keep up with the pace is the most useful, since you can be sure to understand what you are writing down and correct yourself as you go along.  So you may find that pen and paper are the fastest way to go.  You can always scan stuff into a computer if you need/want to as well.",comment,1

However as you progress into more advanced courses, I personally found more need to write small code blurbs, search stuff up & paste links, etc, plus I was way better with LaTeX/Vim/Fancy VSCode extensions. 

I found I referenced my notes a lot more if they were typed instead of handwritten, and the benefits of better recall were more obviated as it was no longer necessary to memorize formulas/routines, but much more important to grasp the underlying concepts.

I’m hoping it lasts until end of June. It’s really really old. It’s not an air. I think my parents got it when I was in Grade 3, so the family got its money’s worth. I wouldn’t know how to use an iPad appropriately, honestly. Note taking is. Likely best, I think? Is Mac the way to go for math?… aren’t math people into androids? We have a newer gaming  laptop we used over COVID?  I could use, that for now. It still has life. Good advice. I’ll wait. Thx.",comment,1

The gaming laptop could serve you well.  Consider getting a $50 wacom tablet (see my other post) to help w/ handwriting notes if you're wanting to save $$ while figuring out what to do.

The laptop+wacom tablet approach will work well if you're in classrooms that have proper tables (like MP103 and most of the BA rooms) but not well if you're in classrooms that have tablet arms (like SS1070, MS2122).  If you're in rooms w/ tablet arms it really is one thing: paper notes, laptop, or iPad.  But you won't know what rooms you're in until you're in them, really. :)

TLDR: it sounds like you should plan to take pen+paper notes but be ready to pivot quickly once you see your classes and your classrooms.",comment,2
