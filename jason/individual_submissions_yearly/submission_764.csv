"MAT244 Fall 2024, where do I even begin? Seriously",VeterinarianFront736,1hh8n5b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hh8n5b/mat244_fall_2024_where_do_i_even_begin_seriously/,1734547869.0,"Note: This course is under Profs. Bernardo (MAT135 flashbacks), and Jason Siefken.

Where do I even begin with this course? I thought that we would be doing ODEs, but nope. We spent most of our time working with Microsoft Excel to simulate differential equations, and not solving them. There are several reasons why this course is horrible.

1. Lectures

The lectures were very, very strange. Walking into the first class, I would be expecting to know what differential equations are, and how to solve them, but nope. First thing we did was population modelling. We didn't get into solving them in class; we had to learn how to do them on our own as it came up in one of our homework sets.

Second, Prof. Siefken literally taught the class like high school. He forced people to participate in class by (1) telling students to put away their phones when he found them, (2) making students yell out an answer, (3) literally leaving solutions in the air so that students could say it. We aren't in high school anymore.

2. Homeworks

The homeworks are very weird. For example, on one homework you could literally get points deducted  by forgetting to state that C is a parameter (when solving a differential equation). Or you could be literally writing a final report that uses differential equations. Or at one point you could be comparing Euler's method to Riemann sums.

3. Tests

Don't even get me started on those. The midterm had a group portion (Probably Bernardo's idea), and we had to use Excel. ON A TEST. And we were only given thirty minutes. It's an interesting idea, but it doesn't always work out.

And what's worse? We literally had a group test a few weeks ago that was 40 minutes long. And it comprised 20% of your final grade. Yes. You heard me correctly. (On the plus side though, if you did better on this test, your midterm group portion would be increased)

Honestly, this course isn't that difficult (it's a nice change of pace compared to other 200-level math courses), but this goes out to the next batch of MAT244 students who will be taking the course under the coordination of Prof. Siefken.",submission,23

A lot of ppl were complaining on Piazza yesterday and wanted to gather and write a formal complaint to the math dept... that's how bad the course is",comment,9
