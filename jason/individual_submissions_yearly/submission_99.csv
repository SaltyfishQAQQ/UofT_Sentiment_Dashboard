FRATERNITIES   NEW SEASON OF DANGER FRATS ANY BINGERS,freshestfreshee,1f1y40s,https://i.redd.it/33srzcvng2ld1.jpeg,1724703387.0,"Lifetime lurker, first-time poster here. I never thought I'd be making an account, but I just couldn't resist. Saw some weird stuff outside and inside the new college today, and I'm dying to know what's going on. Did the devs drop a new Adphi DLC or something? Because it feels like I just stumbled into a whole new expansion pack IRL. Someone please update me before I go down the conspiracy theory rabbit hole.

Like, I‚Äôm already stressing over how hard adjusting is gonna be, and now I‚Äôm worried about UofT turning into some next-level, open-world RPG with mystery side quests that I didn‚Äôt sign up for. Honestly, can we not have a mini-game on top of my already insane workload with these weird realms? I barely survived high school and the warzone of COD, and now I have to unlock university level achievements IRL? Can someone please tell me what‚Äôs going on before my GPA and my sanity both take a nosedive.",submission,218

I‚Äôve seen first hand that they don‚Äôt actually card / don‚Äôt care who goes into their parties and have let 15/16 year old girls in. When they were confronted about this (after myself and friends helped these girls calm down and were able to help them get home safely) the ‚Äúleadership‚Äù basically said they didn‚Äôt care. 

This was just a few months after I had talked to somebody in the frat who insisted that Lambda Chi had changed and that making frats safer, especially for women, was important. And who also insisted that they (Phi Kappa Sigma) were different and had a higher standard‚Ä¶..",comment,72

Fraternities are degenerate, disgusting, and womanizing cults of men that never learned how to say no. They should all be shut down or at the very least have their attendance at parties drop. Unfortunately, with how they prey on high schoolers looking for a ‚Äúthrill,‚Äù naive first years, and victims of SA that keep going despite what happened to them

Bro once the school starts you won't even remember these frats exists man, trust me. I was scared of them last year like you and I was told by our orientation leaders to NOT GO TO FRATS since its not a good place and I never went there ever. Passed by and few times I wanted to try even though my personality is no drugs , parties , alcohol and no sex before marriage . And no I am a weird atheist who chose not loose my dignity for things that will destroy my mind , life and soul . Also surround yourself with the type of people you like and never be anxious if your friend goes to frats . Just set boundaries for yourself and do not overthink. Wish you all the best and DM me if you needed any help ! Enjoy your new journey and believe that it'll gonna be these gonna be the best memories in your life \~",comment,2
