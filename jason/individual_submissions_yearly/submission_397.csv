She said a guy who worked in the biology or some department where they have access to preserved human bodies murdered his superior (manager or prof not sure). She was friends with this guy but found it weird that they never asked for a statement from her since she had talked to him moments before the murder. I know this could be a lie thoughü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è,comment,6
