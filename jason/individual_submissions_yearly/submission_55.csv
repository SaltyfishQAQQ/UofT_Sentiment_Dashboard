I graduated recently, and I never thought I would miss campus life this much. It feels like a piece of my heart stayed behind at the University of Toronto. Honestly, I haven’t felt this low in a long time. The world outside is so different, and every day I long for the comfort I found within the walls of UofT.

I miss the way I could just sit in a lecture in the most quiet corner, absorbed in my own world, aheh. I miss the labs, and I even miss those little moments of venting—when someone was harsh or something didn’t go as planned. Tbh, it feels strange to say, but even the tough times on campus felt softer than the outside world:)To all of you still there, embrace your university life. The sense of safety and warmth I felt on campus was unmatched—like it was a shelter from all the bad things outside.

So for all of you there now, please cherish it. The years fly by faster than you think.  Be kind to yourselves and each other, trust me, kindness is really important. University life is a beautiful chapter, and I miss mine more than I can express.

I know things can get really tough, and the challenges might feel overwhelming at times, but trust me, it will all be worth it in the end!! You've got this, and even in those hardest moments, remember you're building something amazing for your future, failure is a part of SUCCESS!. If you're ever feeling down or just need someone to talk to, I’m here for you. You can PM me anytime you want—I’ll always be around to listen:)<3

Take care of your hearts, and good luck with the upcoming midterms<3

More power to each one of you. 

With love,  
A fellow UofT grad",submission,341

The pressure of making board reports as opposed to classroom presentations. Creating technical briefs instead of writing exams. Staying late at work to finish something up instead of hanging out with friends after class. 

Somedays, I feel grateful that I had the privilege to experience both undergrad and grad school. I met some truly amazing people and had some experiences I wouldn’t give the world for. I miss my university years.",comment,54

I don’t have any course with labs nor is my degree useful to get any somewhat specialized position that would be decent. The only reason I’m even doing it is for the potential jobs that got a mandatory “post-secondary education” in the application line
