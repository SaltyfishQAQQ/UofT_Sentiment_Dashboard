Try to incorporate design and good layout to your CV and cover letter to make it stand out. Don't be afraid to do things differently from other people (you have nothing to lose). The first job is always the hardest, don't be afraid to take on a contract job if there's no other options. Just go into the job knowing that you are not expected to retire there.

After you get your first job, the next one gets easier, and then the 3rd one, etc. Eventually you slowly build up enough experience that you start climbing up the ladder. You'll eventually go to a stage where you get to pick and choose jobs that fit you, rather than the other way around.

Edit: or know someone there who could vouch that you're ""competent enough"". 

Hiring managers just need to fill the role with someone who can do the job. If they desperately needed someone with 100% certainty they could do the role, they would have come to your university to recruit.

Still, you need to interview well enough. Either by having a portfolio or by having a diversity of experiences to which you can use to bullshit their way into getting hired.

 It's how I got hired at my first job. Instead of casting a wide net with a generic resume, I made a few tailored resumes for different roles that didn't directly translate to what I graduated with. The stuff I did in university carried me enough to do many entry level jobs.",comment,1

For example, I did my undergrad in Physics, but I wanted a data analyst type of role so I did the extra step of expanding my Python skills, analyzed a dataset and wrote about it. Once I finished it, every position I applied for, I attached it along with my resume.

Every time I had an interview with a company, they always mentioned I stood out because I had something more than my resume attached in the application.
