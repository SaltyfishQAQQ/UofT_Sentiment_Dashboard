Essentially Iâ€™m screwed. Iâ€™m a rising 4th year in Life Sciences and at maximum my GPA is going to be like a 3.6 (not the OMSAS scale) at graduation and my extracurriculars are very mediocre. Iâ€™m planning on taking the MCAT summer of 2025 but Iâ€™m genuinely confused as to where to go from here after graduation. 

I have 2 options starting from May 2025: 

1) take the MCAT, suck it up and face the wrath of rejection and apply to med school for the 2026-2027 cycle during a gap year (do research, get a certification in a clinical job, etc)

2) take the MCAT, apply to a tech-related masters program to salvage my GPA and have an actual backup career option to help me float, THEN apply to med school

To be honest, my end goal has always been med school (does not matter if itâ€™s MD or DO) but I just donâ€™t know how to go about it being absolutely average. Like I see premeds around me at UofT (and I knew this was going to be the case coming in) but itâ€™s a crazy discrepancy. With the current state of Canadian med admissions Iâ€™m thinking of just crying myself to sleep.

I need advice lol",submission,24

Donâ€™t tell us, donâ€™t tell anyone. 


If you want to be a doctor because you have a burning desire to help people, and you donâ€™t mind being miserable and/or poor while doing it, despite working soul crushingly long hours, then I recommend taking the second option you highlighted. GPA is the most important thing for med school applications. In Canada, in decreasing order of importance (but only slightly decreasing), the reqs rank: GPA, MCAT, CASPER if applicable, extracurriculars, reference letters, essays if applicable, interviews. 

If you want to be a doctor for the perceived money/prestige, I encourage you to reevaluate your career choice",comment,4

Some med schools only look at those, would help you if that GPA was caused by a bad year. Do you have a upward trend in GPA which is helpful for US med schools

Another option which depends on your financial circumstances is taking a 5th year which would very helpful for ECs and possibly getting a high GPA for 2 or 3 year GPA med schools",comment,3

Alternatively, if you speak French fluently + is female, you only need a ~70% average to get into many places. I had a few classmates that made into Canadian med schools that way, 1 had a relative on the board so that helped too. She told me that you need a connection (dean at med school being a relative or such) or speak french or you gotta be a girl/minority/indigenous female to bypass the high gpa requirements.

If you are a guy, a guy in life sci I knew had 95% average overall and applied 2 years straight to med schools in Canada and never made it. 

My family doctor is a UofT grad. He had insane 90%+ in courses before getting into med school and is one of the most competent doctors I have ever met. 0 room for new patients though and any and all bookings are weeks away. 

Many classmates I knew with 70s average went to med school in the states, all doctors now.",comment,2

Average of 3.7 ~ 3.85, you better have an outstanding MCAT (top 5%) + a good interview. You might have a chance 

If you have average below 3.7, you better be famous person or completed some enormous feat otherwise you got no chance
