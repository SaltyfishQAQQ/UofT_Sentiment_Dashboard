I want to feel less bad about getting a B- in a research class where 60% of the mark was groupwork and half the group was seemingly always too busy with work or other assignments to be as enthusiastic about the project as I was.,submission,15

Not a single person did anything, but as soon as I was done the slides they rushed in to slap their names on it. Life’s tough, so whatever, I let it slide. 

One of them had the audacity to delete the content I put in and complain that their part in the presentation was too small like an hour before it was due, and that my stats and understanding of the lecture material was wrong (it was not) so I deleted their name and revoked their access to the slide. 

Never heard about what happened to them but they never showed up to class so I guess they accepted their fate.",comment,11

Had a good project with lots of potential, problem was very relevant (we were all ECE students and the problem required AI/ML/SWE) anf the prototype could’ve been very well made if it wasn’t only me making it. 

Sadly, I ended up pulling the weight for almost everything and it ruined the appeal of the experience for me. The worst part of it all was listening to their excuses (especially when I have the same courses, work load, and deadlines). 

My mark in the course wasn’t bad, but I wish I didn’t end up having to dedicate 5+ hrs weekly to do other peoples’ work for them.",comment,2

I'm in the same boat, with students that barely do anything and are happy embarrasing themselves and the rest of the group, and don't even have skills for design, research or anything. And get upset when you ask them to contribute or say they never have time. One girl in my group has less classes than us and does less.",comment,1

I can rant all day about it, and write paragraphs about all the things that bothered me while working on it, but it boils down to none of the other people in my group seemed to read the assignment details. They got very clearly stated things wrong, but I did think, for the most part, that despite perhaps some signs of not being fully engaged in the project, they would still at least try given how much it was worth. Anyway, it was a video and I didn’t see the final product until after it was submitted, so too late to change anything, or ask them to change anything without serious marks being deducted. Needless to say I was not happy with it, particularly because it violated some really clear criteria that they would have known had they even skimmed over the assignment details, or read some of my texts that reminded/asked them about them (where I got little to no response) and I was doubly not happy once we got the mark back, one that was well below the class average. Pissed me off. They didn’t even pronounce the name of the topic correctly despite having heard me say it when I pitched the idea, and in my section of the project. You would think that even if they’re only taking the course as an elective, they could still put a bit of effort in, ya know? Tsk 

Whatever, I know I was doing better in the course than them overall anyway, and my exam mark pulled up my grade from the project enough that I’m happy with the final mark, so what’s done is done. Caused a fair bit of stress though.",comment,1

It’s arguably worse knowing they have the facilities and time to do good, but decide not to. 

Especially regarding skills, the amount of people who cannot create/format a slideshow or follow basic citation/formatting guidelines is extremely concerning. 

It gets frustrating when the individual(s) does not seek assistant/ask for help, instead just tries to ignore it until someone else picks it up for them.",comment,1
