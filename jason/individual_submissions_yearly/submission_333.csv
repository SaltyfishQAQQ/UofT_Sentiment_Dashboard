Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt be too affected, but the accusations they‚Äôre making are very serious, completely false, and have been damaging my reputation all over UTM.

Honestly, it‚Äôs causing a lot of stress and social anxiety. I‚Äôm considering reporting them, but I‚Äôm unsure if that‚Äôs the right move, or if it could make things worse. I‚Äôm really just looking for advice on how to handle this. Should I report it, or is there another way to approach the situation?",submission,81

There are definitely rumors that have the potential to get you in trouble, or cause you to be the target of harassment or worse from others. 

Even if it's not serious enough for the school to get involved, reporting it will mean that there's a record of it. This could be helpful if things get worse.",comment,17

Let me say something: this isn't high school. No one in university cares. Trust me. If anything, they'll be more pissed off at the rumor-spreaders being bothersome. most high school drama dies out after first year

If the information they are spreading is false and harmful (ex like you SAd someone but you didn't), then contact campus security and report them for misacusations because this can actually get u in trouble.",comment,5
