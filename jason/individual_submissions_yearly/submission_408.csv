What should I do? How do I argue this? Should I admit guilt, even if I didn’t do it? What would happen if I did admit guilt? Please let me know, I’m freaking out.

While I was never flagged (maybe didn't spend enough time away from the tab?), this is an example of a misunderstanding that could be viewed as academic misconduct.

If you didn’t do it, say you didn’t - they don’t just randomly pick and choose random people and they cannot punish you without evidence. If they are calling you in for a meeting, its likely they have a suspicion but need to confirm. If you didn’t do it, usually you’ll be on your way. 

Either that or they have enough proof that you committed a violation in which, hear what they have to say and if its true, the best option is to admit guilt. If you let is escalate the punishment may get more severe and you'll be wasting a lot of time.

The thought process is definitely something that happens to lots of people but in this situation, the professor is acting on nothing but policy and if they can't muster up enough evidence, they can't get anywhere. An admission of guilt is usually what they are seeking in these meetings since its an express ticket to finishing the case. If you didn't do it, say you didn't and plead your case in the same manner the professor is pleading theirs -  the profs aren't the ones deciding the punishment either.

If your prof still has doubts after that meeting, they are required to escalate it and that’s when you need to look into legal counsel. They are also required to escalate if you suddenly ghost them and fail to attend the meeting. 

It sounds like you may have done something you regret so I’m gonna be honest: profs take academic offences very seriously and they know how to spot them. Regardless of the circumstances that caused one to commit an academic offence, it’s still an academic offence. Profs cannot be bamboozled and they can’t just say “well you made a mistake, let’s just forget about it”. They see this all the time and while some may be overly cautious, the majority of profs know when something looks strange enough to flag. I’m not trying to scare you but U of T takes academic offences seriously - they’ve even gone after people who have graduated 1+ years ago. I’m not here to judge but I just really want you to consider that if you have done anything that breaks the rules, lying or trying to ghost will only drag the process out. You have to consider whether trying to keep up with a lie is worth the length of time it will take for your prof to investigate and, if unsatisfied with your story, escalate the matter to tribunal. ",comment,1

It goes into the steps the process follows and I believe there’s a link on there discussing possible sanctions. 

Unfortunately, if after the meeting the professor suspects or receives confirmation that an AO has been committed they are required to make a report to the Department Chair or Dean. If it’s a more serious offence or someone does not want to admit guilt it will go to the Dean but more minor AOs that people confess to are usually settled at the Department Chair level. I can’t speak to what level your situation might be handled at but the above link is good to consult. 

Also just wanted to say that I understand this can be scary but please be kind to yourself. You made a mistake but you’re human and owning up to mistakes is honourable. Learn from them and don’t let them define you. An AO can seem terrifying but it’s not the end of the world, I promise. ",comment,1
