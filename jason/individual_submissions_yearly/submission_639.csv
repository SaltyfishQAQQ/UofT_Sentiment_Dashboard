The changes are aimed at those diploma mill colleges that accept thousands of international students just for the tuition money, and then teach things like wheelchair racing and coloring books ([Real story btw](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/cdi-college-lawsuit-settled-edmonton-nursing-students-1.4671504))",comment,101

New study permits we will have to wait and see but I feel most of the changes will apply to schools like Conestoga. Targeting U of T study permits would not make sense since these are the students Canada wants. 

As for PR, PGWP, and immigration after graduation? That's another story and while the government alludes to changes I don't think anything has actually been announced.",comment,17

I know there are protests happening by students whose work permits expire at the end of this year, because they're probably going to be deported because of the cap/pause on visas.

The only change is you can no longer get your spouse a work visa during your study if you are a underground student (don't know this existed before). If you have not obtain your study permit( like a freshman just received an offer) then there is an extra step for applying for your study permit (a letter from the province). This is an attempted to bring the province into the loop but really shouldn't be a barrier for you. On the other hand, I doubt this is the end of the immigration reform, consider how the federal political wind is blowing, I am not optimistic about the future for international students in general. Try get to PR as soon as possible I think.",comment,1

U of T and all other universities in Ontario technically do have a ‘cap’, but it isn’t going to be exceeded and hasn’t affected any enrolment.

However, these caps don’t apply to students who are already enrolled. So it doesn’t apply to OP.
