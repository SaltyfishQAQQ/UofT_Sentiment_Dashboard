Cope mf’s who think the encampment was some huge negative for convocation. Students were able to go on stage with keffiyeh and some went up with the Palestinian flag and some with banners in support of the movement, and those students with the flag or banners probably got the loudest applause. Overall great experience and no interruptions. 

Congrats to all my fellow grads!!!",submission,1613

But what would the University do? Ruin the ceremony by making a scene and not allow someone who worked hard to get their degree not have the freedom to present themselves how they want?

Regardless of whether Hamas is a terrorist organization or not, it doesn't excuse Israeli war crimes. And quite honestly, you won't find many people that actually support Hamas. Standing against Israel's terrorism doesn't translate to supporting Hamas.

I'd usually avoid saying this but objectively speaking Israel is a terrorist organization as well, just one the West doesn't want to designate as such.",comment,43
