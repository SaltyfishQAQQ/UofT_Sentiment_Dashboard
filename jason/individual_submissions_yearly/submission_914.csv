Asking my Prof for a Recommandation Letter          ,Ray123212321,1fnvdml,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fnvdml/asking_my_prof_for_a_recommandation_letter/,1727125434.0,"Basically I'm having his fourth course this semester. He's my fav prof and he knows me very well. So of course I would ask him for a letter. I sent an email last week and went talk to him today after class.

He said he a ""sessional contract prof"". dk what that means but apprently according to him, a letter from him wouldn't have the same value as a ""full-time prof"". 

Is it true or it's just an excuse? Cause I know he got three different courses to teach this fall so he's super busy, which is understandable. Besides, as long as he holds a PHD, and he knows me better than anyone else it should be fine right?

Now the thing is he said if I can draft something for him, he might consider the gig. So what should I draft? Do I just write the whole letter myself and have him sent it for me? Would that be a little disrespectful? Or I just give him some information about my strength and past studies, something he can write about. 

I always thought profs have a template for recommandation letter lol dk if thats true",submission,15

It's not an excuse and the prof is right. Most profs are happy to write references to students they know well. He's letting you know this in advance because he wants you to be aware of this limitation.  

  
Still, if he's the best option you have, I don't see a harm in asking.",comment,16

It's true. It's still better than getting one from a TA and it's definitely better than nothing.

>Do I just write the whole letter myself and have him sent it for me? 

Yup. You're basically glazing yourself. Write sentences about specific experiences, skills, and strong points you want to highlight. Look up examples online when you got time.

Some do, some don't.",comment,27

If you need the letter for applying to grad school, professors who can speak to your ability to do research are far better references then a prof who says ""Ray123212321 was a student in my class and got an A"". What exactly are you hoping they will be able to contribute to your profile that would encourage an admissions committee to admit you?

If it's for something else then maybe.",comment,1

I also work for a lab, and the prof does the same thing. YOU write the letter, and the prof will look it over and make small corrections. Outside of that, the prof will then just sign off on it.",comment,6

This assumes you know both profs equally well. In this case, letter from research prof is more likely to discuss attributes that your prospective grad profs care about given their common expertise in managing research labs.
