In my second year, I had a maybe a 2.0 if I was lucky. I was struggling and reading the Syllabi was hard‚Äîwriting was hard‚Äîand nothing I did seemed to make sense once I got a mark back.

However, in my third year, I buckled down and got a 2.8. Then in my fourth, 3.5. I took a 5th and 6th year to finish a second degree entirely to give myself some time to grow and finally ended with a 4.0 my final year. 

For my masters applications, I didn‚Äôt get my top pick and ended up at the U of T, where I continued to grow and got accepted to every place I applied for my PhD. ",submission,101
