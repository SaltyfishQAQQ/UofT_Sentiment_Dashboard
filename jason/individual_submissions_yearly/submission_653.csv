Ideas for a passive income source alongside my undergrad studies,Admirable-Ad6183,1hpaxs2,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hpaxs2/ideas_for_a_passive_income_source_alongside_my/,1735520355.0,"Hey guys! 

I just finished my first semester at UofT and boy was it tough. I love how summer me thought I could balance a part time job, social life, academics, studying, fitness, and fun at UofTears. But then my first semester ended up being reduced to purely studying and I had no balance! 

Looking back, I realize I went out a lot with friends and sometimes I couldn’t meal prep and spent money on food. Over time, it compounded and I spent around 1K on food this semester. Yikes!!!!! 

So I was wondering if anyone has any ideas of how to have a passive income source or a way to work a small part time job with flexible hours and casual workload throughout the semester. 

I wanna do something maybe after classes or  on the weekends to just support me financially. 

Does anyone have any ideas or work part time jobs now that are pretty chill? Would love to hear from you guys! ",submission,29

by far the highest ROI you can achieve is getting some experience in the field you want to work in. and a bonus is if you can get paid for it.


second best is TAing, which is good pay (40-50/HR), and you can get some letters of recommendations and learn some life lessons from profs.


if you can help it, if you're in a good financial position or being supported by parents, don't focus so much on the money. obviously don't spend on frivolous things, but in the grand scheme of things a couple grand is not a whole lot. if you can use your energy and focus on networking and getting a part/full time job/internship in your industry this will pay dividends for your whole life.


in the words of ramit sethi, focus on $30k problems, not $3 problems",comment,6

Maybe invest some money? However you likely won't be getting much ROI if your principle is low. It is a source of passive income in the sense you could chill off dividends. If you pick ETFs or Spilt corps with high div yields you can probably get $0.1/share with shares around $6-9CAD ea per month. So you're looking at around $80 invested to $1/month earned - not including any capital gains. 

So I wouldn't really suggest doing this unless you have an investing account set up already and at least $5k laying around that you wouldn't mind investing. If you don't have that principle, investing is not going to get you the returns you want or anything near just working a couple hours at a job. Furthermore, I'm personally not an avid enjoyer of withdrawing from investing accounts, you're basically killing the gains - so in that sense, you probably wouldn't be in the best state for investing since it seems you'd like to use the money on a regular basis. 

In that case, you're probably looking for not-passive income - working a job. See below. 

**NOT PASSIVE (but probably what you are looking for)**

1. You probably won't be getting a TA position as a first or second year. Maybe in your final year of undergrad studies. Don't spend too much time chasing them (most are held by PhD and Master students). You could however look for tutoring positions in your faculty, those are more open to undergrad students.
2. CLNx jobs are good only if you have a \*good\* chunk of time off, most of the jobs are part-time but they require a large time commitment and usually are 9-5 positions. If you're a STEM student that might be hard to juggle. However if you do find some good jobs with lower hours, do apply on CLNx. Another tip is to find somewhere local to work (near the area) and see if they offer work that suits your schedule better than the jobs on CLNx.

If you aren't looking for an immediate solution, next year you should **apply to work-study**! Its the perfect solution. You usually only work 4-6hr/week (for 8 months), extremely flexible, theres tons of positions available and its only available to uoft students. The pay is usually minimum but you can get much higher than that if you get a more specialized position. I worked work-study last summer, made around 2k - didn't even feel like working. Definitely check it out if you're gonna take summer courses or for next year (you have to be enrolled in at least 1 course to be eligible for work-study).

Best of luck!",comment,2

while it can take some time to apply and get certified w/ the mandatory trainings, it does not take much effort to clock in and clock out during your shifts once everything is set up and confirmed.

And there’s another cycle for summer that’s during the final month of winter semester. If you missed the dates unfortunately you cannot do anything but wait until the next cycle. So there’s two different cycles which break up the year. Note, again you need to be enrolled in a course if you plan on working work-study for summer. 

And yes, there’s tons of jobs. Most of which will actually give you good skills (ie Excel, Filing, Report Writing, Research, Programming etc,.). The most common ones you’ll find are probably Office/Admin assistants. There’s also a handful of research positions but they are usually very competitive. All the jobs will have “assistant” in the title since you’re only going to be working like 100-200 hours tops which isn’t enough for the employer to allocate too many responsibilities to you. 

I worked as a data analyst/administrative assistant and got paid ~$20/hr in first year summer. Learned a bunch of different things and had the opportunity to write reports, present my findings, pitch ideas for the coop program at uoft and more. Totally worth it.",comment,2

Most of the jobs are placed by uoft offices, they just want a chill person who can work. They aren’t like massive Fortune 100 companies lol. 

Most of the places that are hiring specialized students (usually for jobs like analysts, research, CS) do ask for a transcript but they don’t have a bar (must be higher than 3.3 etc,.). You can be sure that they look through your resume instead of auto rejecting based off a low GPA. Unless you’re doing research, then usually one of the qualifications is essentially a high GPA. Also, for like unspecialized jobs (anyone can do it, you don’t need much prior knowledge) they have no requirement for transcript.
