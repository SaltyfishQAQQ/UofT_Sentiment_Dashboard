"meeting regarding phone use in washroom, how to proceed? ",Emergency_Reality0,1has5kt,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1has5kt/meeting_regarding_phone_use_in_washroom_how_to/,1733800135.0,"just to be clear, this is not an AO. I received a letter from the Dean of New College today asking to meet (with priority: High) because I was reported to be using my phone in our residence communal washroom a couple weeks back. I'll be honest with you, I am aware there is a no phone policy in the washroom, but I see people using their phones in the washroom all the time. Some are even blasting music during showers, so I thought it wouldn't be a big deal and would sometimes carry my phone with me. I have no idea what happened on this particular date (idek who reported me) so idk how to talk about the incident when they ask me. What's funnier is that my roommate got the exact same letter for phone use on the exact same date, and believe me, we do not use the washrooms together. So maybe someone was keeping watch on that specific date? Anyways, I am really confused as to how to proceed and what the potential consequences might be. Is there any chance of this showing up on my official records? Should I just be honest and tell them I don't remember and I lowkey thought its chill? Any advice would be amazing. Honestly can't deal with this during finals",submission,25

The Dean‚Äôs Offices frequently call students in for conduct violations (breaking rules). You‚Äôll most likely just be told to not do it again like any other conduct case (unless they have some other reason to think you broke other rules, which doesn‚Äôt seem to be the case).

The school doesn‚Äôt have an ‚Äúofficial record‚Äù for stuff like this. It‚Äôll likely go in your residence file as an instance of you breaking a rule, but that‚Äôs not really relevant to anything outside of residence. The only way there would be anything serious is if they had some reason to believe you violated some larger UofT policies or broke the law. 

If you just had your phone on you, you‚Äôll be fine. Don‚Äôt overthink it.",comment,36

Also thank you so much for the words of reassurance, I can't be taking more stress rn",comment,3
