**First Semester: (2.5 credits)**

*CHM135: Chemistry: Physical Principles*

- i found this course so hard at first. so hard i scored 50% on the first midterm which absolutely recked me bc i was good at chem in highschool. i decided to put a lot of effort in this course from then on and ended up getting a 100% on the 2nd midterm and above 90 on the final. ended up with a 94% on the course, so working hard gets you the grade for sure. do the tutorial questions theyre so helpful and v similar to what comes on the tests and finals. the lecturers were SO good for chm135, loved them all, they actually teach well.

*BIO120: Adaptation and Biodiversity*

- i hated this course with a passion. its about ecology which is the topic i find the BORINGEST thing to learn about. i hate it so much. i hated the labs, the lectures - it was all so boring. the lecturers for bio are so monotone and boring i hated them so much. all exams were multiple choice tho and not too hard EXCEPT for the final. i think the class average was probably really high before the final so they made the final SUPER hard, a lot harder than the midterms which was annoying bc i expected something similar in difficulty like the midterms were.

*MAT135: Calculus I*

- the most unorganized course. the lecturer was new and went in circles and didnt know how to explain any concept. the course coordinator was bernardo which is so bad lol. the tests were fine. the ACTs (applied communication tasks) were SO badly explained i had to go to sooo many office hours to get info. i think they ended up curving the grade cause i ended up with a A- which i know i couldnt have actually have gotten bc the course went SO badly.

*CSC108: Introduction to Computer Programming*

- LOVED this course. if ur looking for a good bird course to do this might be it! i only studied 4 hrs for the midterm and 4 hrs for the final and ended up with an A+ on the course. the lecturer was so bad, he was so unorganized, felt like he didn't prep at all for his lecs but that was fine since all content is learnt through videos they make u watch before class and do questions on (you can find this vids on yt btw). i had absolutely no programming experience when taking this course and yet it was fine, so if youre worried about that, dont be! the course is designed for those with 0 programming experience. the assignments were also so fun to do (although some parts def did make me want to throw my laptop across the room :))

*PSY100: Introductory Psychology*

- didnt think this was as bird of a course as uoft reddit made it out to be. its not a hard course, but it requires effort which you dont have time to give to an elective course. i took it with denton so maybe thats why, there were so many readings from the textbook and u had to buy the textbook to access the homework which was SO annoying. got an A- in the course through knowledge i had from a level psych.

  
**Second Semester (2.5 credits)**

*BIO130: Molecular and Cell Biology*

- again, hated the lecturers. SO monotone. felt like sleeping in lectures. ended up skipping majority of lectures and teaching myself through the textbook and slides. i also attended a few of yips lectures instead of the lecturer i was enrolled in bc i heard he was good. its true, yip is good he's phenomenal. if youre looking for a good prof, its him. lecture hall was ALWAYS packed bc i guess a lot of people did the same thing as me, skipped their own lecturer to go to this one. loved the content of this course, so much better than bio120. ended with an A+ thankfully. its kind of a memorization course.

  
*CHM136: Intro to Organic Chemistry I*

- had 3 different lecturers for different parts of the course, they all were AMAZING. explained concepts so well. i also loved organic chem from a level chem so this course was nice. it started getting pretty hard near the end but it was fine after watching youtube vids + going to office hours to understand the content better.

*MAT136:  Calculus II*

- this course was SO AMAZING compared to mat136. i think it was bc there was another coordinator that wasnt bernardo. it was Lindsay shorster (idk if i spelt that right) but i had no complaints about inorganization as i did with mat135. lecturer for this course was SOOOOO good i didnt miss even one lecture bc he was that good. his name was Daniel Hudson. i truly felt like he was excited to teach and was so enthusiastic. the course progressively gets harder fs but not too hard to manage with background knowledge of a level math.

*CSC148: Intro to Comp Sci*

- i took this course bc i found csc108 easy so i was like why not, BIGGEST MISTAKE EVER. this course is so much harder than 108 lmao. it was fine until the midterm. after the midterm it was a shitshow for me lolll. the prof was so good i just found it so hard to understand the harder concepts like recursion and linked lists omg. ended up with an A on the course idk how. i feel like they curved. joonho was so good tho if ur looking for a good prof to pick, pick him. hes funny too.

*~~CSC165~~*  *HPS110: The Science of Human Nature*

- i took csc165 and then dropped within the first 2 weeks bc it was not for me with no background in proofs lol.. frantically looked for other available courses and stumbled upon hps110 and heard that its an easy bird course so i took it. so this course is  about different popular psych topics/ research. there were SO many readings every week like im not kidding they sometimes assigned 60 pages. i never did the readings fully lol. before the midterm and final they give u a bunch of questions that could come up and pick from those to put on the test. so i would just answer those questions fully by looking at the readings, memorize my answers and do the test with that. the TA was such a harsh marker for no reason like please. The worst thing about this course as an international student was that its final was scheduled to be on the LAST DAY possible. i had a 18 day gap between my second last exam and this last exam. i could have gone home 18 days before but had to stay for this stupid course. i learnt absolutely nothing from the course do not recommend it at all lmao.

I just didnâ€™t have the time to nor was I interested in doing 60+ pages of readings in my free time lol. But, even tho I didnâ€™t do the readings, I still got 80% on the course, but I honestly think they curved bc I donâ€™t think I could have actually gotten that. The evaluation is: 2 assignments worth 5% each, each assignment asks u to write a 250 word max paragraph on a question they give u based on the reading. Thereâ€™s tutorial attendance grades too, you get 1% for simply attending a tutorial and a further 1% for answering a multiple choice question they ask in the tutorial correctly, so tutorial grade all together makes 20% of ur grade then the midterm is worth 30%, they ask 2 questions that each require a paragraph answer and then one essay question - everything is based on the reading but you are NOT allowed to bring any readings to the test (so insane since you had to remember specific names of researchers and couldnâ€™t refer to ur readings in the exam to help), BUT they do give u a bunch of questions that could come up and you can answer those by looking at the readings and memorize ur answers for the real thing - thatâ€™s what I did bc I hadnâ€™t done any of the readings so I would just skim the readings to find the answer and type up a good answer and memorize it for the exam. BARE IN MIND tho that itâ€™s almost impossible to find some of the answers to the questions in the readings and u have to skim through hundreds of pages to find the stupid answer lmao Iâ€™m literally angry thinking about it, it took SO much time. Then the final is worth 40%, again itâ€™s 2 hr long and has the exact same format as the midterm.",comment,2

Even I had no prior knowledge in cs and did really well. U donâ€™t even have to attend lectures since everything u learn for the week is learnt through these videos they make u watch, which u can find on YouTube. just watch through them and decide whether u wanna take the course or not. It does get a little difficult near the end but that stuff barely even comes on the final. Thereâ€™s 3 big assignments and theyâ€™re honestly so fun to do! Thereâ€™s a LOT of help hours as well if ur stuck. The first assignment took me 3 hrs to do and the rest took a day or two, then thereâ€™s very small mcqâ€™s to do every week and a small coding assignment (takes 10mins max to do) to do as well and all these are worth a little towards ur final mark, idk what exactly the weightings were. Then thereâ€™s one midterm and a final and u had to get above 40% on the final to pass the course (this is the reoccurring thing in most cs courses for some reason, they always make it so that u must get above a certain percentage on the final or else u fail even if ur total percent before the final was above 50%.) but this course is A LOT LESS time consuming than hps110, so easy to deal with when u have other heavy courses that require more of ur time & attention.",comment,1
