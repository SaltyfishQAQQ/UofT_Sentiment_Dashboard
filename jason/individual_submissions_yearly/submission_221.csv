I am sitting and studying for my 206 midterm tomorrow in the commons, thanking the lord I found a study room during midterm season so I can focus and study. 206 requires alot of brain power. ive been awake since 7 am. and there's this group of girls in the study room next to mine YELLING. not talking, YELLING. at each other, laughing like fucking hyenas. I am going crazy. I cannot mess up 206. how does no one here have common courtesy. I dont have it in me to tell a group of seniors that I need to fucking study and they need to be at least a little respectful of the fact that this is a library and a quiet floor. HOW DOES NO ONE HAVE ANY DECENCY DO YOU AHVE NO FUCKIGN SHAME?????  I cannot do this anymore. I am going crazy ",submission,126

We were studying for a course in robarts as well, and these girls next door were yelling and also laughing like hyenas (maybe it's the same group ðŸ˜­). We banged on the wall a few times and they shouted ""sorry"" and went quiet for about five minutes. After those five minutes, they became loud again so we just left. Aside from the walls being paper thin, it's surprising how people feel the need to act like lunatics in a library of all places",comment,52
