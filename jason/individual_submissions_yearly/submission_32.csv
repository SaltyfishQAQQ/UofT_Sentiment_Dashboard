Why the University of Toronto has the biggest aura,EthnicPakMan,1cs1kgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cs1kgv/why_the_university_of_toronto_has_the_biggest_aura/,1715716805.0,"University of Toronto… U of T… the name radiates fear, even the abbreviation.. Shivers go down the spines of many when they hear of or see the UofT logo. The dark blue background, symbolizing the empty abyss it is. The university that has killed hundreds. The university that has garnered the notorious nickname U of Tears. The university where people, even for those who were accepted to the most competitive programs, hesitate to accept the offer, knowing the sheer rigour and difficulty of the school. Some people dare even apply to this spine-tingling and formidable university, even knowing they may be a competitive applicant. 

When you hear “Waterloo engineering”, you think of a nerdy kid constantly glazing and coming all over FAANG, but, when you hear “UofT engineering”, you think of a large and empty nothingness. You think of a battlefield, where every man is for themselves. You can feel the University of Toronto coming inside of you. When one finishes their degree, they are not only a UofT graduate, but a survivor, and a warrior. They stop and think to themselves, “this truly was, the University of Toronto”. ",submission,456

I had the 90-95 grade in normal Canadian public school. First semester came around, most people kept their high school habit even if they went though an IB or AP system receive marks of a max 3.0. My first semester here, I had courses I dreaded going to and had courses I spent 10-15 hours per week. After 2nd semester of basically this, I have realized it’s all about keeping up with content to be successful here and to receive above a 3.5. I’ve also realized the under estimation of how creativity goes into both mathy and qualitative courses. However, my n-size is few.",comment,1
