adjusting to a very different way of living is rough. living in a new place on your own is rough. adjusting to uni courses and the way uni works is rough.  
you're going to get the hang of it and it will become more tolerable. the first few months i was MISERABLE. based on my experience and people i've spoken to, this is pretty normal, and this will pass. 

ride out the semester, keep trying your best. living on campus can be really fun and affords you opportunities you didn't have living at home - take advantage of it and have some fun and the hard parts will feel worth it. i don't know you but know i believe in you and you're gonna be feeling better soon, just give yourself some time.",comment,35

If you love science, you have the opportunity to learn from some of the best in the world. The material you’re about the engage with is going to be WAY more interesting than you’ve learned in high school. You’re going to meet people who are on average so much smarter than in high school. You will have the resources to learn how the world works in a completely different way than you had before. You got in so you’re obviously no stranger to studying. The style of studying changes but you learn how to manage that.

You learn how to do other things too. Living alone, figuring out all that adult stuff is something everyone goes through. Trips home are going to be sweet if you miss it that bad. Lots of people don’t have something they want to go back to. You might not have met your best friends yet. You certainly haven’t had your best educational experiences yet.

University isn’t for everyone and I wouldn’t push to stay and look on the bright side to just anyone, but you mentioned that you LOVE science. Well friend this is the place for you then (university). If it’s truly about location then after a year you could consider transfers but all you can do about that now is do the best job you can - that will open up doors for transfers and if by then you want to stay, you will have done yourself a service by doing well in the meantime.

I truly believe it’s good for people to at some point leave what they have behind and go grow as a person. This is that painful growth stage. You have it in you to turn this around. A week is not enough time to evaluate. Stick it out and either you’ll be rewarded or you’ll learn something very valuable. You got this!",comment,7

i’m telling you, this is really part of the process unfortunately - it’s all just growing pains. change is scary and i remember almost completely shutting down and being so so depressed during my first semester. i wanted to give up, but i didn’t…which i am so so glad about. 

please just keep attending ur classes, try ur absolute hardest to talk to people (i promise you that it’s not as scary as you may think it is - and this is coming from a total introvert), and look for things to do outside of school (concerts, art classes, going for hikes, biking, etc). 

uoft also has so many amazing clubs, and i made a lot of friends through that. i personally got involved in campus theatre, and actually, a lot of productions are accepting applications for actors/backstage crew right now! working on shows with other students was such a cool way to spend my time during the school year!! highly recommend it even if theatre isn’t something you’ve been involved in before!

Leaving your home, and living alone for the first time in your life kinda sucks, especially if you  were not particularly independent during high school.

If you call it quits early, these problems don't actually go away. You will still have to be independent at some point, and when you do all these feelings will return. Better to go through them when you're younger, more adaptable, in an environment that's most conducive to learning, then when you're older and more set in your ways.

Over time the shock and novelty of switching from a controlled environment where most decisions were made for you, to being able to make your own decisions and pay your own consequences for everything you do will wear off. The shock at having a more normal adult level workload will also wear off; at some point you just get used to a more rapid flow of information, and you develop skills to balance all these competing priorities while getting your work done.

The fact that the thought of this is uncomfortable is an indication that you're growing up, and facing new challenges. It's also your signal that your existing stress management techniques are insufficient. You should look into breathwork, meditation, exercise, and group activities that will force you to go out even when you don't want to. You can also try signing up for a psychologist, though based on things I've seen on here the appointments are rare and far between, and the effect is not amazing.

Other than that the only real answer is to stick with it. Yes, it sucks, but it's a level of suck that you will acclimate to over time.",comment,1

Your experience might depends on the following: what’s your specific degree, how different is your home from Toronto, how organized you are, and how sociable you are before coming. Sounds very random but those determines exactly how difficult of a time you’ll have and how sick you’ll get of, not just U of T, but the Toronto city as a whole. Having a rigorous degree (Engi, BioChem, Med, etc), in a city that’s like an alien planet, everything falls in chaos, and naturally don’t like interactions, means this really isn’t gonna work.

As to coping mechanisms. I’m sorry but I don’t know anything other than gritting teeth and pushing on. Maybe take a break, skip a lecture if you can afford to miss one, it sure eased something for me. It will get better at some point, not good, but better, I know I did when I dropped a few courses and reevaluated what I really want to do at this point.

As for people saying quit UofT or transfer because its too hard, don’t listen to that crap. I’m a UofT grad student right now and did my undergraduate at McGill. The level of preparation and overall depth of the material I encountered at McGill far exceeds the preparation that my UofT peers got in undergrad.

You are currently at one of the best institutions in the world and you’re going to learn from renowned and incredible experts in their fields. Do you know how many people would kill to have anything close to the opportunity you have? If that isn’t enough to convince you to get your mind out of the gutter and focus on the thing you love, which you mentioned is science, then I don’t think that you are considering the right things in your summary of uoft being hell. Nothing in life of value comes easy and our parents knew that. To put this in reference for you, I’m 26 and graduated from uoft 4 years ago. It was tough at first but I focused on my ambitions, as one must always do, gave it time, and here I am today. You do not know where this journey will take you in a few weeks, months time but you will sure regret it if you do not give it a chance and fight for your passion for science.",comment,0

Responsibilities go way up, but pressure comes way down. You could be at one of the biggest companies, in a very fragile position, and pressure will never be as high as some semesters. It's not as lonely, not as intense, the biggest downside by far is if you find a position that depends on you, they tend to call you during the night which can become routine.",comment,2
