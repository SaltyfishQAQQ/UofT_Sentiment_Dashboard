I just got my grades back for a course where my final exam mark would have to be 0 to obtain the insanely low final grade. I have emailed by TA, professor, and college registrar, what else can I do besides waiting? :(

UPDATE: It's been solved! My exam was misplaced.",submission,48

Unfortunately sometimes final exams get misplaced during marking, or the final grade isn't properly recorded. You've done the right thing by asking the TA and instructor to see what's going on. Was this an in-person exam? If so, there will be a record that you actually wrote the final so getting a zero on it would have been a real achievement",comment,93

 Hopefully this gets fixed in a matter of weeks and not months.

The only other possibility is that you might have gotten an Academic Offence??? but they would email you about that",comment,6

Not that I'm suggesting that this is the case for the OP but it's something to bear in mind, in general. :)",comment,12
