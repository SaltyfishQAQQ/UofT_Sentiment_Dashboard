I am planning to study life science at St.George. What i am really worried the most is that my bio grade went from a 6 to a 4, which is very scary to me because that is the most important subject. Does anyone know if that is terrible news, or something that the university does not care about.

I’m pretty sure as long as you end up obtaining your diploma, your offer still holds. You’ll probably have an issue obtaining any transfer credits though as you need a 5 in Higher Level subjects to obtain them.",comment,26

Also just a side note: a little context would be helpful here for others lol, people might not know what points you’re referring to or the whole grade scale",comment,10

In any case, this is a good time to have a hard reality check. Why did you score so little in the IB? How do you expect to work in university? Why do you think you will do better and not make the same mistakes as you did in the IB? Regardless of whether UofT recinds or not, and although its hard to hear this, 29 is just a very low score and not at all a score that ""good"" students should get. You should do some serious reflection as to what went wrong and how you can improve. 

I wish you the best of luck.",comment,1

My important subjects are chemistry, biology and english. My chem predicted was a 5 with final being 5, bio was a 6 predicted with 4 final, and english was 5 predicted and 4 final.

They give specific grade targets to ontario students, they probably just account for the fact that there is much more variability between predicted and final result among boards like the A-levels and IB. 

I’ve known people to have been predicted a 42, dropped to 35 and gotten into their program of choice. I personally dropped 2 points from my predicted in my best subject (7->5) and was fine, even got the transfer credit.

I can’t guarantee you will get in because I can’t lie 29 is a little low especially if you were predicted a 35 but I understand the difficulty this season among the leaks and whatnot.

Were you offered your initial choice or your backup admission stream choice? If you were offered your initial choice I wouldn’t worry at all about dropping the points.",comment,4

Academic standing is usually more of a status of “good academic standing” for not being on probation and no academic misconduct. But depending on the country it could mean grade bands (e.g. in the UK they have different classes for degrees, and falling into another class could be a change in academic standing).

Still, the only people who can answer this with certainty are admissions at UofT. So if you want to know for certain you should contact them; otherwise, it’s conjecture.",comment,3
