"I donâ€™t understand why UofT SGS would take so long with confirmation of degree requirement requests because Im going to graduate before I receive this letter, making it useless",mellytomies,1d1tkya,https://i.redd.it/wpocj27whz2d1.jpeg,1716822216.0,"My employer wants confirmation that I have this education from UofT, but I graduate this year and have nothing but a transcript with grades on it. There are no degree conferred indicators. Grades were only just posted on May 15th, so I couldnt have known that I was eligible to graduate until after this date. I thought the grades being posted would have been enough to demonstrate that I am graduating!

Meanwhile this email says you could have submitted a request on May the 1st. But I only got my grades back on the 15th ðŸ˜­. 

This is my complaint: I will graduate and get my degree before my confirmation of degree requirements letter will be received. A 15-20 business day wait time far exceeds my convocation date. What is the point of this process if the wait is this long?? The whole point should be to confirm I have graduated before actual graduation. 

UofT, please, just tell my employer that Im going to have this degree. I cant start without it. It would really suck to be rejected as a candidate because of these bureucratics.

I also have a job offer contingent on my degree (although I'm graduating in June), but they were satisfied with a PDF export from Degree Explorer showing all graduation requirements being met.",comment,9

Worked for Rotman students. It was sped up for folks who asked for expedited documents. (But it's still extremely delayed for a few that went with the normal timeline),comment,2

I have submitted my grad request + am doing convocation + have confirmation emails + tix and everything.

From April 10 to June, I have been in this non-degree limbo that consists of waiting for grades, and waiting for a confirmation of degree requirements",comment,2

I'm also graduating in June from UofT and I was stuck in a similar situation until a few days ago. I waited 10 days before I started following-up with SGS explaining my job situation. I asked SGS to expedite my letter, to which they responded that its upto the program completion office. Check with SGS if they vetted and forwarded your letter request to the program completion office. This office is responsible for processing the letter, which includes writing it and sending it out to you. You'll then have to get in touch with the completion office team and hope for the best. Feel free to DM me if you need any help :)",comment,3
