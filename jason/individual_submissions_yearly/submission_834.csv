What to do when your mental health begins to take over?,LiamUchiha1,1gv50i8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gv50i8/what_to_do_when_your_mental_health_begins_to_take/,1732042949.0,"So I got a question for all my mentally unstable peeps and besties, how are you managing??? I've missed a few lectures this semester already because either my ADHD or PTSD would flare up and keep me at home. I feel really guilty missing lectures cause I feel like I'm missing key information that I'm not getting from the slides, but I'm also trying really hard to pace myself when I'm feeling low and need to recharge.
 I got 3 major assignments due next week and although I did the readings and know what I want to write about, all of them are about 2000 words in length and it feels like such a hill to climb. Do any of y'all have any strategies to overcoming your mental issues and push through during peak periods??? ",submission,20
What to do when your mental health begins to take over?,ViridianWizard,lxz27qo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gv50i8/what_to_do_when_your_mental_health_begins_to_take/lxz27qo/,1732043387.0,"1. Are you registered with Accessibility Services? If so, request an extension (if you have accommodations). If not, reach out to your college registrar for academic advising and to get them to request extensions for you.

2. Are you able to access UofT's Same-day health and wellness counselling services?

3. Relax. If you feel like you're pushing yourselves through the limit - **stop**. Step away from your work and take some moments to have breathers. The near end of the fall semester is usually overwhelming for many folks. If you feel like you have way too much courses, speak to your registrar on doing late withdrawals without academic penalty. Would recommend it on courses that can be taken in the summer/winter.",comment,10

i also never bring my phone charger to school to make sure i don’t play games all day (since i need to save battery for the commute home).",comment,5
What to do when your mental health begins to take over?,mystudentwellbeing,lxzhpnw,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gv50i8/what_to_do_when_your_mental_health_begins_to_take/lxzhpnw/,1732048113.0,"Hey OP. Another Redditor mentioned the U of T same day counselling service, but I wanted to mention another mental health service option for you.

If you have the UTSU Health Plan (the extended health), you have coverage for private mental health counselling with eligible therapists. We ([My Student Wellbeing](https://mystudentwellbeing.ca)) are in the process of getting several therapists available to offer sessions to U of T students (note: we're not affiliated with the U of T in any way) and your Health Plan would cover 100% of the cost of some of our therapists depending on the coverage details of your plan (all our therapists are fully licensed; no students or interns). You'd be able to use your Health Plan with private therapists elsewhere, but we try to make it really easy for you to use it with the therapists in our network.

Depending on your student status (what campus you're at, how many courses you're taking, if you're a grad student) your Health Plan would likely be able to get you up to 7.5-15 sessions (depend on the coverage limits) fully covered with some of our therapists, so you'd be able to get regular support for several weeks/months. If you're interested, [you can register through our website by clicking here](https://mystudentwellbeing.ca/registration/) and we'll notify you as soon as we have therapists available (we're aiming for this week or next week at the latest). We can also help you figure out the details of your insurance if you aren't sure if you have coverage. If you want to see who you can book with, you can visit our website, click ""Book a Session"" in the menu, filter by Ontario, and see who your options could be.

Spending 50 minutes to talk to a therapist may sound like a lot of time when you may think you should be using it to study, but a therapist can help you figure out how you can climb that hill and manage life when your ADHD, PTSD, or anything else comes up. You don't have to work through it all on your own.

If you have any questions about this, feel free to reply to this comment or contact us through the website. You can also take a look through our Reddit history to get to know our organization more to help you feel comfortable with us.",comment,1

I am registered with accommodation services so I think requesting the extensions will work out a lot better. 

I wasn't even sure we had same day health and wellness counselling services so this was good to know!",comment,4

TTC especially cause it triggers me into overstimulation during rush hours and it's sooooo freaking hard to bounce back when I get home cause I'm mentally burnt out from the commute. 
I really appreciate you taking the time to share some of your tips too, and genuinely wishing you all the best on your finals!!",comment,2
