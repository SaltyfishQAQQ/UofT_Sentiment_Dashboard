what's that old MLK quote? 

""I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.""

sometimes you can break victimless rules, because there's a larger ethical problem present. Anyone trying to walk it back is a disappointingly cowardly human being. At least the fascists and the genociders are standing for their awful ethnostate. What do the people who reject these protests while feigning concern for the genocide stand for?",comment,3

I guess theoretically it's possible if both sides are around a 50/50 split. But I don't know if that's the case in this scenario. I don't have any data on this but it seems like the Pro-Palestine side is the majority in this case. But I could be wrong, I'm just going off my intuition.",comment,12
