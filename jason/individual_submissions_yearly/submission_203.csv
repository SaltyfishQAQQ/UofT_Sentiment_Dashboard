I took a year off after grad to address this, feeling no difference i decided on doing a masters degree abroad (i got into uoft for masters but got this massive wave of anxiety after my acceptance and declined for this reason) now that im doing my masters abroad its a similar feeling in that im just not motivated to study and just feel dumb overall, i wait till the last minute for exams feeling no difference its like i just dont care anymore? ive passed all my classes this far with this behavior and mentality but i dont know how to fix it? has anyone else had a similar burn out and how have you dealt with it?",submission,138

Some level of burnout is likely to be expected if you grinded very hard but maybe this is worth discussing with a professional.,comment,25

This could be health related, financial, lifestyle, family, social / romantic etc. 

A lot of people do stuff and go to school because they feel like they have to. I‚Äôm of the opinion that most people should not be getting university degrees or pursuing desk jobs. Some introspection on what is truly valuable to you will be life changing.

For me, I have alot of financial anxiety so I had no choice but to work for money during highschool and university, and after I graduated. The burnout was insane. I ended up taking a role that underpaid and overworked me, couldn‚Äôt afford rent and got a second job to do at the same time. I was really miserable. It took a lot to get out of the depressive slump, but it worked out because I realized what amazing friends I had, and then I got into a really healthy relationship too. I realized that I value my relationships with select people, and that my end goal has always been starting my own family :) (far in the future though I‚Äôm still youngish)

I hope you can find what makes you feel whole!

Also, I have adhd and I‚Äôve rarely been motivated too. I was also last minute for exams, individual assignments, and only anxiety and shame would get me to grind (usually because I didn‚Äôt want to let group mates down). I‚Äôd advise talking to a professional because it could also be depressive traits. However, if it is adhd, I still advise you to find something you enjoy - and maybe school isn‚Äôt it for you, try actually living your life and explore where you‚Äôre travelling, try working odd jobs in retail, service, at parks etc.",comment,9

This is part of the infrastructure which is part of your school fees. They would know exactly how to get to the root of it. There are also academic counsellors who help direct your educational choices. Studying and doing well is isolating and the whole pandemic part of your studies probably amplified this. I know myself I have a type of restlessness. For you it‚Äôs tied to your worries or exploration about your future. If you are in Europe studying enjoy little side trips away from school. All the best to you.,comment,3

Are you feeling burnt out because you‚Äôre aimlessly pursuing a Masters degree? I could understand that if you don‚Äôt have a definitive goal in mind, or at minimum a general goal in mind.

My advice is to change the goal. Surviving is not a goal, change it to thriving. Try to over achieve in what you have left in your degree. And get minimum 60 minutes of Vigorous physical activity daily. Once you graduate the despair of the job market will smack the burnout right out of you. Cheers",comment,1
