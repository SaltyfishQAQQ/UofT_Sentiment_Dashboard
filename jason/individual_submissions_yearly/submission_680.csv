Does anyone need someone to vent to or listen to them?,RareCombination4171,1cfs54n,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cfs54n/does_anyone_need_someone_to_vent_to_or_listen_to/,1714371812.0,"I recently had a really rough semester, that pretty much gave me the beatdown of a lifetime just as I'm finishing up my 3rd year. 

But I had an awesome friend who really took the time and listened to me rant & vent about my problems this semester, which isn't something I usually do. 

I kinda realize how rare it is for someone to actually sit back and honestly just listen to what others have to say. 

Idk if this is the place for it, but if anyone wants to vent their frustrations or to just have someone to talk to, pls don't hesitate to reach out. 

I get how brutal and absolutely soul crushing it can feel at the end of a semester sometimes, so I hope if anyone feels unheard or doesn't have really have anyone to listen to you, can reach out if you genuinely just want to vent and talk.",submission,29
