I’ve also heard of someone offering to pay for 12 months as a way to win a bidding war for a place they really wanted.

Needless to say, giving that much money up front is a massive risk and puts one in the position to get screwed way over.",comment,5

And it seems to be increasingly standard practice.

My parents have a triplex near the Humber College Lakeshore campus, and over the past few years they’ve had international students offering 12 months up front as well as offering a slight premium on the posted rent (about $200-$500 per month). Officially, my parents only require 2 months, and they will never ask people for more than that. But if someone volunteers, by their own volition, to pay up front then we are obviously going to pick them over someone else because it substantially reduces our risk. And lately there have been a lot of people volunteering to do this, but ESPECIALLY international students because they know that they’re seen as risky (no income, no credit history, no co-signer located in the country).",comment,7

So what they do is just go with people willing to pay longer periods in advance like 12-months. They usually don't outright say this since it would land them in trouble but I heard this a lot from realtors I worked with to find rentals. A lot of these renters willing to pay so much in advance tend to be very well off international students. In my experience, landlords who do this are typically independent apartment/condo owners charging exorbitant rent for a shoebox-sized condo unit. Places managed by property management companies tend to be better in my opinion and don't pull this shady shit.",comment,3

The best bet is to get an agent. We had to pay first and last and also had to offer two other months of rent up front that covered months ten and eleven. It was competitive and it came down to the landlord choosing the people he felt might cause the least amount of trouble for himself or others living close by. It's not right, but the agent came right out and told us that renters sometimes discriminate against certain groups because of complaints about food smells and other cultural stereotypes that exist around Toronto. That being said, if you really want a place you're going to have to play the game to some degree. It is the law that landlords cannot ask for more than first and last months rent, but it is now common practice to voluntarily offer more to secure a place. Good luck with the hunt, but I definitely recommend you stay off Kijiji and the groups on Facebook because they're all shady and most are scams from my experience.",comment,2

1. Is there no guarantor?

3. Is the student international student?
4. Some even ask for transcript to see if student is responsible


Previously being a student at uoft I had landlord asking for post dated and some cases advance payment.

But many usually require documentation, and if no possible documentation can be supplied then land lords need to lower their risk to rent.

Most landlords are fair until they get screwed by a few tenant that either don’t pay rent and it takes up to 6 month or more to evict or party and trash the place",comment,1
