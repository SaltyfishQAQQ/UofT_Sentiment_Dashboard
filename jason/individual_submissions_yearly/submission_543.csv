I took the bus to utm and listened to some music. The bus was empty and the snow storm outside was so beautiful and the music fit the mood so perfectly and I've never had that feeling of being completely at peace again. Idk why on earth I decided to go that day in terrible weather but I'm so thankful I did.,comment,21

Thatâ€™s the first thing that comes to mind, maybe not the happiest moment per se. Lots of video games [ I played OOT for the first time and it was legendary] and Iâ€™d enjoy doing math back then.

Then UofT happenedâ€¦.

I am really glad to hear that!! Ahahahaha I can completely relate to this!! Now that I think about it I was very hopeless to get into anywhere back when I was in high school... I am still shocked that I am in Uoft... Even though I am still trying to deal with stuff in life but I am also very happy and proud of myself that I made it here and standing here ! 

  
Well for me I have and had a lot of happiest moments in my life but I think the best time i had was the time that i had to spend in the hospital and the friends that I made there!! It was the only time that I truly felt I am happy without needing to worry about dealing with toxic people and other shitty things in my life... I still remember me having tears in my eyes before I leave the place... met the people that who knows if I am ever able to meet them again... Honestly the best lesson that I learnt in my life is trusting your guts and just standing strong even though sometimes it feels like you wanna give up... Not giving a damn about sick people who enjoy making fun of others people's lives. There's gonna be days when you can't do anything and things won't go in the way that you want but I truly believe that everything happens in our lives for a reason. Its just once you are experiencing those feelings you wanna give up but in a few years later after you will be glad that you made it through those hard moments and you realize you understand life way better than most people so you are able to help others which it feels amazing! Hahaha I have so many haters but let them say whatever they want. They all have so much time to waste to discuss my failures ... I am also one of those kind of people that is always laughing and smiling . People think I am a clown but I am just trying to make others laugh cause I genuinely love to see others happy. And even when I am walking alone and you see me , you'll think I am a drunk person but I am just enjoying my life and trying to cheer myself up. This is just who i am :))))  
  
Anyways I wish you all the best and hope you have a good night !  And stay strong buddy !!",comment,4
