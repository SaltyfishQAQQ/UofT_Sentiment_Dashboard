Is there a major that combines mathematics and biology?,payloadchap,lc21on7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dxjs8t/is_there_a_major_that_combines_mathematics_and/lc21on7/,1720368384.0,"Since you enjoy specifically mathematics and not CS, your best bet would be to do something like a double major in Statistics and a life science program of your choice. Statistics is used extensively for anything relating to public health. Ecology can be big on statistics too. 

The quantitative biology major is more so a program that you'd pick to complement something else, since it's really just a haphazard assortment of different math/stats/CS courses alongside life science courses. It doesn't really contain any ""special"" courses that combine math and biology. Another possibility would be the Biological Physics specialist - PHY231, PHY331 and PHY431 are all applied physics courses for biological applications.

Other than that, just go for mathematics and biology as majors or specialists. There's job opportunities in drug discovery, which mixes mathematics with biology and chemistry. That's definitely a field of work you might be interested in.

If you're someone who's really passionate about both, by taking a double specialist (or one specialist, one major), you can gain a good amount of knowledge that can allow you to find a bridge between them in the future. Of course, that depends on the research you might do, the masters/PhD programs you take, and all that. 

But if you truly like both, study each separately and bridge the gap yourself. Oftentimes, programs which mix two fields end up lacking in a true understanding of either field, as you have to sacrifice something in order to bridge the gap.",comment,3

Consider a double major in math and whatever type of biology you like best (macro or micro).

If you're an FAS student, try to take APM348H1 in your third year [https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/apm348h1](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/apm348h1) and introduce yourself to Adam Stinchcombe at the end of your first year or second year [https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=CRlA-sEAAAAJ&view\_op=list\_works&sortby=pubdate](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?hl=en&user=CRlA-sEAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate)

Note: there's a wide range of first-year math courses that count towards the major and there's no reason why you can't do courses like MAT137 or like MAT157/MAT240/MAT247 and still do a major rather than a MAT137-stream or MAT157-stream specialist.

Biology or biochemistry mostly relies on stats, maybe some schools make you take calculus 1 but it's a really shallow class compared to calculus taken by engineers and physicists (I did one year in biology before switching so I saw how much the sillabus was different despite the same name of the exam, in fact had to retake it from the start). Mathematics at the bachelor means you'll do math + some physics and computer science classes, at the master and PhD level you have the possibility to do some applied mathematics classes that have applications in biology (biomathematics is useful in ecology, but also in biomedical research, the numerical analysis of blood flow in the heart) but it's not like you'll lean any new biology besides the high school stuff you know. You could double major or minor but that's mostly for education purposes, I don't see any advantages in doing it. Physics is heavy on math and you could minor in bio and then study biophysics (math and physics applied to biological systems), or also medical physics (all the machines they use on the hospital for oncology and radiochemistry), but not everyone that like math likes physics (the opposite is true though so if you like physics as well you'll find enough math to keep you satisfied). Engineering is also an option, not the heavies on math compared to physics but besides physics and math it's probably the degree that requires the most mathematics (some economics and computer science department do as well, but engineers always take calculus, differential equations, linear algebra and analytical geometry, and you can also take topology and differential geometry or whatever class if you want as electives), depending on what you mean by ""I like biology"", biomedical engineering will make you take basic anatomy and physiology, biochem, immunology and microbiology+ biomaterials, biomechanics, medical devices which are engineering classes so there's at least calculus 3 involved. Environmental engineering has some ecology and botany, microbiology and geology (geochemistry, geophysics) and while geology isn't biology most people that like bio like earth science so hey, who knows, biochemical engineering is mostly chemical engineering but instead of petroleum or polymers it's applied to pharma and food industries so there are some biochem, food chem, biochem classes as well. Finally computer science/computer engineering or electrical engineering focusing on bioinformatics but you'll probably never see a lab since it's mostly computational stuff, like applications of math in genomics and proteomics. But of course engineering is mostly math applied to a problem, like biophysics pure biology isn't required and you'll probably learn only basics undergrad level bio unless you double major or go to graduate school and focus on research in a multisciplinary fields.",comment,1

I can see this isn't the case. Generally speaking, mathematical modelling for biology comes in two forms: deterministic models and stochastic models.

With deterministic models, there will be a lot of calculus (ODEs, PDEs, difference equations etc.) and linear algebra. Many of these models directly draw from the principles of physics, which is why it would be useful to learn both math and physics for this angle.

With stochastic models, you would be going deep into probability theory. This type of modelling is typically seen in more macro-level fields like epidemiology and ecology where you model populations, but also exists on the micro-level too with all the random collisions between molecules in the body.

I know you said you aren't interested in statistics, but mathematical statistics goes well beyond data analysis and will absolutely involve significant amounts of calculus, probability theory, and to a lesser extent, combinatorics. I would highly recommend looking at some of the specialist programs for mathematics. In particular, the Applied Mathematics specialist and the Mathematics & Its Applications (Probability/Statistics) specialist could be great fits for you. You could pair this with a major/minor in the life sciences and this would prepare you very well for graduate studies in mathematical biology.",comment,10
