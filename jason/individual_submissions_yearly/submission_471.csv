University is not the right fit for me and I'm considering running away,deleted,1h5bvfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h5bvfh/university_is_not_the_right_fit_for_me_and_im/,1733189657.0,"It's too much pressure. 

However, I have to admit that I'm not the best student, as I had been caught with bad acedemic integrity (writing a test after the time is up).


Going on, I don't think I'm fit for the university. I'm always expected to be a top student, where people will have too much high expectations to me. 


I can't go anywhere without making the slightest mistake by setting people off.


I don't hate the university, but it's not the right fit for me. I'm better off doing college (which is what I whish I got into instead of uni).


Everyone I meet have unrealistic expectations. They treat me as if I'm a model who is pedestralized. It makes me anxious and stressed. It's not good for my mental health.


In fact, I belive that the U of T (including most of the GTA) is only acceptable for people who have high intelligence or who are wealthy individuals. I'm not a match for them, so why even bother staying here?


The best thing for me to do is to leave in the next few years before my mental health will eventually become worse (although I have very thick skin).


It doesn't matter anymore. It has to be done.",submission,50

In my first year in uoft engineering I thought it was extremely difficult but now I think it is pretty doable to keep a good gpa and have a social life as long as you manage your time well. The problem I had was I thought everyone was very intelligent but in reality, they just manage their time well and have a lot of friends who can help you when you are overworked. Thats what I did. I havent done a single assignment this whole month for a few courses cause I usually take it from my friends and I help them later in return in other courses. You just gotta get used to managing your mental health by doing some relaxing stuff like hanging out with friends or playing sports. Thats what worked for me.",comment,2
