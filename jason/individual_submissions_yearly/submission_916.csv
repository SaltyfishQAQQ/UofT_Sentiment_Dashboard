Adulthood is very difficult and the transition feels particularly rough in those first years. I’m almost in my 30s and… it’s still got its challenges. These things don’t get easier over time but we do get better at managing them as long as we stay patient, practice gratitude, and remain disciplined. In fact, those three tenets are the *highest* forms of self-love. 

With that in mind, my biggest advice is to remember that this is a marathon, not a sprint. Don’t neglect your other needs - eating right, getting active, getting good sleep, socializing, good hygiene and going outside - as these are all necessities for a happy, healthy and homeostatic human.

You are not alone. Stay strong my friend. You got this.",comment,5

It shows how reliable your personal growth and tenacity will be coming out of this experience and that you won't be at the mercy of circumstance in order to reach any goals in your career or personal life.

Some parts of life can be scary and often that paralyzes us and we can't move forward because we feel overwhelmed. For those times, I have this -
""Can we still be brave if we're afraid?... That's the only time we can be brave""

Hope this helps, good luck and you've got this!!",comment,4
