5 ft 7 
Gym 7 days a week with makeup workouts for days missed. 
Hobbies: watching AdinRoss , playing league of legends, watching movies & TV series such as FBI, Found,From ( shows far better then the basic stuff ) 
Foods: love me a good pizza or burger

Cooking skills: make a Ramen noodle with a scorpion pepper that will burn , can make a great hot dog , and maybe some chicken breast or steak 


I have a rare condition where I need the girl to be my version of a 10/10 or I can't finish in bed. Call me shallow all u want but dead serious. So need a patient girl who don't mind a guy who can last extremely long time in bed 

Income: over $100K
Age:36

Requirements: must wear makeup all the time including underwater. Must be brown maybe a rare asian theoretically

Must put out some head in the first date and be amazing in bed to show they are serious and not just trying to get some fancy outings! 

Must Have good hygiene and ideally be a gym. Otherwise it's like a lemon. I've seen girls 75 pounds balloon up to 180 fast af. Discipline is important  

Ideally their career isn't onlyfans or being a hooker.",comment,1

Primarily: the programmers implemented gender as a 32-bit integer with dudes as positive and girls as negative. Unfortunately they also used the same tracker for xp cuz they had constraints on memory usage, which results in OPs gender wrapping around from M to F due to the shear amounts of xp they will have.

Secondarily: the programmers just assume anyone who plays this long doesn‚Äôt know how to handle human interaction with anyone but themselves, so they just make it easier by assigning the pointer for bf/gf back to yourself.",comment,3
