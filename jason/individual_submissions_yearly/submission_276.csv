If you don't use notion already, use it!!! its great and that's where i have my schedule, deadlines, and notes. I have a good template I made from multiple templates if anyone wants to see it. 

IDK if anyone cares but might as well post the post. ",submission,100

Obsidian does everything Notion does, but it runs and stores files locally on your device instead of on a server which means:

A: You can use it offline

B: It runs much faster with no lag

On top of that, the community plugins are amazing. you can find a plugin for basically anything. Of course you can't forget the graph view which lets you visualize all of the connections between all of your notes.

Notion is a note taking app, Obsidian is an extension of your brain.

I'm sorry for shilling so hard, but this is like the difference between playing Vanilla Minecraft vs Lunar Client. It's night and day.

Edit: If you're worried about customizing the theme, it has that too. There's an entire section for themes in the community tab.",comment,17

I use mine like a google calendar, I have personalized logs for things like meal plans or workout plans. I mean not to sound crazy here, but I definitely use it for way more than just school if that makes sense. I really enjoy that it keeps me super organized in a way that nothing else can. To me itâ€™s like having 20 different apps in one platform. Plus I found the learning curve relatively easy which is why I also liked it. Use the keyboard shortcuts and itâ€™s smooth imo. 

I want to agree that the offline is annoying, but to my knowledge thatâ€™s never caused me issue. I see notion as an extension of my brain, not just note taking. Also to be blunt the customizable themes and pleasing aesthetics are a huge part of why people use notion over other stuff. (Okay I just googled Obsidian Themes and they do look nice, but pretty much the same as notion so Idk why id switch)

Have you used notion for an extended period of time? Iâ€™d be down to switch if you insist itâ€™s that much better lol. You have me half convinced already.",comment,1

Youâ€™re deep into their ecosystem and with very limited portability, migrating to other services would be hard.Â 

This is pretty bad because if Notion shuts down/goes bankrupt, makes their app worse or if there are better options in the future, migrating away from them would be too much work.",comment,4

There were several occasions where I had to beg my parents to turn the wifi back on because I needed some notes from notion to finish homework/study which was very annoying, although this is definitely not an issue for most people.

Also there is a Calander plugin (which I donâ€™t personally use (maybe I should tho)) and IIRC, it lets you directly create events/due dates in your various notes and connects them to the calendar. So itâ€™s more like an extension of your notes instead of just a separate tab.

Whether you want to switch is up to you. Itâ€™s unfortunate that youâ€™re already so deep in the ecosystem so it might be tough. Ig it just depends whether you wanna go through and copy paste everything",comment,2
