Got 91 as final grade. Saw a post about a guy being salty on ed. Tbf i understand the frustration some students might have when they see those grades (though i am sf happy for myself). Had a friend going with 92 into the final and got 76 in the end. If thats the standard that UofT has to get students into post its ridiculous tbh. Seems like theyre cherrypicking which ones get to go into the major. Or might be difference in grading of some papers. In any case see you guys in 207 next fall those who make it,comment,1

They curved up so much that countless people got a 100. Also CS PoST cutoff doesn't depend on the avg. It is more related to the third quartile.,comment,6

For the programming knowledge, i think having somewhat experience in ood (such as java, python) would be enough to prepare u for the first year cs courses, especially they will teach u the basic and fundamental stuff in csc108 (and thats why people strongly encourage u to take 108 in the first semester). But the real problem relies on how good u are with math since csc165 does not axtually cover any materials regarding coding/programming, rather proofs and runtime analysis are focused on csc165.",comment,1

You will need to find stuff online and teach yourself discrete math, especially the proof techniques, it will come in very handy for csc165 in the future. Although u may learn them in mat137 in u of t, it is always better to learn stuff in advance. 
For the latter question, the competitiveness of cs post for out of streams are about the same for utsg and utm. So if ur concern is to choose between the two campuses, rather than the cs program itself for among all the other universities, than id say why not go for one in utsg? I wouldnt even bother looking at utm cs. 
my only priority was to get into u of t cs program, regardless of how many years and attempts it takes to actually get into the major. Ofc it was worth for me to try anything possible to get into post whether it takes more than my first year, and thats why i repeated the course.",comment,2
