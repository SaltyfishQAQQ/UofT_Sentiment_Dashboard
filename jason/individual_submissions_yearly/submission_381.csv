You don't want to live with regret. If you have a crush on someone, ask them out. If they turn you down, it'll suck, I know it sucks firsthand, but you'll never know unless you actually try. 

This is not a UofT student thing. People can balance romance with studies and work and all that stuff. This is a people are afraid of getting out of their comfort zones thing.",comment,8
