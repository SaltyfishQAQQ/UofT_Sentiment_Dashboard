Comments on dropping courses and waitlists as the school year starts,deleted,1f8arvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1f8arvf/comments_on_dropping_courses_and_waitlists_as_the/,1725396213.0,"Hello UofT community!

I wanted to make this post just so to make people abit more aware of the mechanism regarding waitlists (and in particular when they close). Officially, waitlists closes on Thursday September 12th - this is the date when students who haven't gotten into a course already would not be able to get into that course. With this in mind, for students who are relatively sure that they will end up dropping a course (and the course have a waitlist) please be mindful of your fellow students on the waitlist and attempt to drop before September 12th! This will be a very thoughtful gesture and I am sure that I, along with many other students who are trying to get into courses through waitlists would highly appreciate this.

For those reading, thank you for your time and please consider upvoting this post so that it becomes more visible!

Thank you!",submission,20

So, check on your course frequently to see if someone dropped after the waitlist deadline. My professor told us this today.",comment,5

I picked the session with the shortest waitlist (2 out of \~70 capacity, compared to 5-7 for other sessions) for a higher chance of getting in. I did get into that session (\~10 people dropped the course before the date), but I ended up skip to attend other lecture sessions due to conflict with other courses. In general if you think the new course offer a large advantage compared to the current course, and there's a almost-sure chance you can get in, they you can definitely drop a course and waitlist for another.",comment,3
