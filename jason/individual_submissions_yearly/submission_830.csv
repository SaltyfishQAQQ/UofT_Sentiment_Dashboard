Anyone else struggling with this???,submission,18

Getting passed around different offices is unfortunately quite common. 

I think your registrar is your best bet and academic advisors tend to be amazing at solving problems like this. It’s frustrating that there was a wait to get a meeting but it’s that time of year. I hope it gets resolved.",comment,2
