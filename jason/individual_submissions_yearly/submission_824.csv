"Is this CMP1 for UTSG CS? Just accepted, want to make sure",JustSom3Guy2077,1d61nd5,https://i.redd.it/3h9yibz5524d1.jpeg,1717290109.0,"Is this the CMP1 admission category for UTSG CS? (The one where you are guaranteed the CS major/specialist if you get 77 in CSC11, 70 in CSC110, and MAT137)

It didn't say in my offer letter that it was CMP1 just that I was offered studies in Computer Science in the Faculty of Arts and Science.

Silly question I know but I want to make sure that I accepted the right thing lol",submission,20
