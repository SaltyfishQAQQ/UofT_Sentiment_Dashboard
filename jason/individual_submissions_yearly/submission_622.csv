Is the Canada Room a real thing or is it just a lie perpetuated by Big Micheal?,ThatGiftyUnedited,1fm04nm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fm04nm/is_the_canada_room_a_real_thing_or_is_it_just_a/,1726915092.0,"I've been trying to find the Canada Room (alleged St. Mikes dining hall) for almost a year now so I can get a commuter meal plan and eat on campus, but I've asked the registrar and looked online for a specific location, and it doesn't look like it exists. However, every time I try to look for other dining options for SMC, it all just leads back to this ""supposed"" Canada room (no location given even on the official SMC website by the way). Am I just ultra stupid and there really is a Canada room somewhere on campus or is it all just a hoax? Thanks",submission,32
