CSC165 grades coming soon; Here are the adjustments they made,EternityProfound,1cneqo0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cneqo0/csc165_grades_coming_soon_here_are_the/,1715200668.0,"* Your mark on ACORNÂ **already**Â contains every adjustment described in the rest of this message.Â **No further adjustment will be made.**Â Even if you ask, the answer will be: ""I'm sorry, but we cannot just raise your mark a little bit. Many adjustments were already made, and making any other individual adjustment without a strong academic basis would be unfair to the rest of the class.""
* All term test remark requests were processed before final marks were calculated and submitted (this is the main reason why it took so long). You can view the results of your remark requests directly on MarkUs. The distribution of test marks posted on the syllabus (Term Tests & Final Exam section) has been updated to reflect the final marks (including all remarked tests).
* **We cannot release exam marks directly to you.**Â There is a formal process you must follow to view your exam: please speak with your college registrar if you want to find out more about your exam. However, the distribution of ""raw"" exam marks has been posted on the syllabus (also in the Term Tests & Final Exam section).
* A general adjustment of +4.5â€‰/â€‰65 was made to everyone's final exam mark, to account for the general difficulty of the exam.Â *The distribution of exam marks posted on MarkUs does NOT include this adjustment*, the adjustment was made only in the calculation of final course marks.
* Next, small adjustments were made to term test marks for each lecture section whose performance was significantly different from other sections (using the final exam as a reference). All adjustments made were positive (no test mark was decreased); all adjustments were at most +1.5Â **points**Â per test (not percentage, but raw points out of the total on the test), andÂ **most**Â adjustments were less than +1 point per test.
* Finally, a general adjustment of roughly +5% was made to everyone's final course mark, beforeÂ **rounding**Â to the nearest integer (e.g., 74.4 â†’ 74, 74.5 â†’ 75).
