A lot of my high school did go to uoft but despite that, I only have one close friend going and she's in a completely different program. Talking to people felt extremely surface leveled; the conversations only went as far as being like, ""oh what's your program?"" and ""where are you from?"" before anyone you talked to would then just go on their phones and it would be this awkward silence. I'm not saying it's got be super deep but it's just so hard to talk to people as an introvert. There were times where I felt intimidated about how cool or smarter or more ""out there"" the others were and I felt so out of place. Although I met a few people I though were cool, I definitely wouldn't have gone the whole week knowing that it just really wasn't my thing (and that's okay). I guess I placed too much pressure on myself to make friends and be more out there but it got to be too much for a certain point and just should have left when I felt like it. I did like talking to the older kids running it especially because they were pretty easy to talk to and they gave me a hint of their experience so that part of it was really nice!

Edit: I think it‚Äôs definitely the right thing for some people to do and I think my experience doesn‚Äôt reflect what others might experience ",submission,163

But I did make 1 really good friend from a completely different program that I still keep in touch with today, where we meet up every few months or so, despite me never talking to pretty much everyone else after the first week of school.

Quality > quantity.

And even if you don't make any friends, it may help you in indirect ways (e.g. you start a new job 5 years from now, notice your coworker is a familiar face from orientation and at least you two can have an easier conversation over that).",comment,48

An event designed to assist you in making friends can feel really forced. Basically the only guaranteed connection you have with these people is your college, and unless you live in rez most people will never even know the college you‚Äôre in.  

I think the superficial level of socialization is a part of what was disappointing. You‚Äôll meet people in classes with shared interests, group projects, clubs, etc. you don‚Äôt even have to limit it to U of T. The city has a ton to offer (like hobby classes/workshops, organizations, etc) and you‚Äôll meet people who are into the same hobbies.

Orientation is a social mixer: you meet many people for a brief time, and it's a good idea to prepare some questions in advance that would lead to meaningful conversations. For example, you may ask what are people's goals for first year university, what kinds of opportunities they will leverage to help them grow academically, professionally. What are good networking events to meet upper years for advice etc. The moment you land in university, you should adopt a strategic mindset, taking purposeful actions.



>There were times where I felt intimidated about how cool or smarter or more ""out there"" the others were and I felt so out of place.

  
Coolest is not something you should focus on at university. People may appear 'smart' at orientation, but that is not an indication of their success rate in first year.

I think people‚Äôs experience really depends on how attractive they are. Orientation week is like Tinder irl. I was forced to lend a pen to this girl and befriend a bestie hers. I didn‚Äôt know what kind of questions to ask after the basic name and program. Next thing you know they were interrogating me like the FBI about where I went to high school, what the town was like, best high school courses, girlfriends, what clubs I did or look forward to etc etc and what dorm

Turns out we in very different dorms but they got my number and next day told me to come over ‚Äúright now!‚Äù. I was like where am I supposed to go and they said they will text me address. Address turned out to be one of the girl‚Äôs dorm and we ended up hanging out and I met 2 more girls who were friends with them. This ended up being my main social group of friends for the first 2-3 years.

I was the guy they dressed up in native fur clothing on Halloween and went out on parties 3 nights per week (yeah the rape rooms at the frats are real), and I was the only introvert in the whole group. From them I learned a lot of socializing skills and being able to talk to more people normally and being less socially stupid (but still was socially stupid for a long time after). 

But it was all probably cause of my looks. And I guess with time they trusted me the more stuff we did. But at the beginning there would be nothing else for them to go on but my appearance. I know many guys that just never got connected with others especially girls and some were very miserable because of it.

Looking back I‚Äôm pretty sure majority people were just judging each other‚Äôs worth of their time based on attractiveness.",comment,-4
