However its totally doable and I definitely think I will pass, I just had to isolate it for myself. Last year I took two semesters with 6x courses and had to drop PHL245 because it was too difficult for me. Having it now as an isolated course where I can focus my time on it I feel like I will pass. However you might do better than me overall, so all I can say is study hard and good luck!",comment,3
