Didn't Know it Was Not Open Book for Canvas and Tabbed Out Multiple Times,ResponsibleCry6418,1fmywdu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fmywdu/didnt_know_it_was_not_open_book_for_canvas_and/,1727026835.0,I just did a quiz on canvas assuming it was open book but the quiz was so easy. I didn't need to tab out once to look at notes besides to check my answers when I was finished the quiz. But during the quiz I tabbed out just out of boredom or to change music multiple times. How bad is this situation I am in would you guys recommend me just emailing my prof and explaining the situation? he seems like a reasonable guy.,submission,17
