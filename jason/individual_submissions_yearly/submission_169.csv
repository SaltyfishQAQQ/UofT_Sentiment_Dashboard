"A Review Of Every Course I Took at UofT (CS, ‘24)",heatfinix,1dpr5a8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dpr5a8/a_review_of_every_course_i_took_at_uoft_cs_24/,1719494496.0,"Inspired by u/[iromatsuurii](https://www.reddit.com/user/iromatsuurii/) I wanted to share my experiences as well. I used to be fairly active on this Reddit, many people helped me out here, so I thought I’d give back.

I completed a CS specialist so I will be mostly covering CS courses, but I’ll give some other advice related to PEY, and maybe some more general advice as well.

**Disclaimers:** Each year includes courses I took in the following summer term as well. I will indicate these courses in the title. I will also indicate the course delivery method I participated in. There may have been hybrid options, or recordings, however I will indicate my experience. If not indicated, it was in-person. Finally **take everything with a grain of salt**. I have my own opinions on things. You should do more research, take into account your character, and consider changes in courses throughout the years.

# Year 1 (2019-2020)

**CSC108:** Introduction to Computer Programming. **Prof:** Mario Badr. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A+.

* Mario is a top 3 prof. Seriously goat status. The course itself is fine. It’s a bit boring if you have already taken CS courses in high school which was my case. I took it to review, stabilize my knowledge, and ease into uni. Some say it’s bird. My sister whose in life sci took it and ended with a B+ but she didn't enjoy the course much. Overall good course.

**CSC165:** Mathematical Expression and Reasoning for Computer Science. **Prof:** Daniel Heap. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A.

* I really liked Daniel’s teaching style. The course is actually quite hard for a first year course, but it’s well taught with many resources. If you study hard you’ll do well. Make sure to spend as much time as possible on problem sets and go in for help (sometimes they’ll give hints). The term tests were quite easy and the exam is only somewhat hard. I hard focused this course cause I had to get into POSt. My year was the last year before they introduced direct CS POSt from high school.

**CSC148:** Introduction to Computer Science. **Prof:** Mario Badr. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A+.

* Again, goated prof. The course was on par with 108 in terms of relative ease I would say. Easy to get a good grade if you try. Well organized course. Start your assignments early and get a good partner (my partner did nothing). That said the exam was cancelled due to covid hitting us around March/April. However, generally the 148 exam is known to be brutal.

**MAT137:** Calculus with Proofs. **Prof:** Asif Zaman. **Crs Avg:** C+. **Mine**: B+.

* Easy top 3 prof at UofT. He seems to really enjoy teaching and his style is amazing. Super nice guy too. The course is very hard, but mainly because you’re in first year and the conceptual gap from high school math and uni math is massive. You need to study A LOT for this course if you want a good grade. Definitely doable though. I do however think the courses eases up in the later half. There’s a lot of discussion about 137 on this sub so search for it. Some further discussion here:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/lwmtnw/mat235\_or\_mat237\_summer/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/lwmtnw/mat235_or_mat237_summer/)

**MAT223:** Linear Algebra I. **Prof:** Jyothsnaa Sivaraman. **Crs Avg:** C+. **Mine**: A.

* Honestly a boring course. Didn’t enjoy it much. The prof was fine but maybe a bit boring. It felt like a very unserious course. Unfortunately you need to take this course for many upper year CS courses. Regardless, easy to do well in especially if you went to high school in Ontario.

**STA130:** An Introduction to Statistical Reasoning and Data Science. **Prof:** Liza Bolton. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A-.

* Overall the course not too conceptually difficult. I don’t think it’s useful to take this for CS unless you care about R or want the Data Science POSt. In some sense it’s a bird course since the content is easy. Final project just needs a good group (like always). Exam was also straightforward. The prof was great, enthusiastic.

**SMC199:** Intelligence, Artificial and Human. **Profs:** Gerald Penn, Jean-Olivier Richard. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* This course is a bit polarizing. It’s an “AI” course but it’s only in the philosophical/historical sense. Lucky for me I love philosophy and history. I highly recommend it if you’re into that kinda thing. Both profs are very intelligent. More discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/h0oa6t/thoughts\_on\_my\_planned\_schedule\_for\_1st\_year\_cs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/h0oa6t/thoughts_on_my_planned_schedule_for_1st_year_cs/) (look for my comment, but there are some other courses discussed as well)

**HPS100:** Introduction to History and Philosophy of Science and Technology. **Prof:** Hakob Barseghyan. **Delivery:** Online Asynchronous, Labs Online Synchronous. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A-.

* This course is pretty birdy. It’s mostly a history course. Most marks are from essays and the final is also an essay final with some multi choice/true false. Lectures are fairly interesting.

**CSC236:** Introduction to the Theory of Computation. **Prof:** Bahar Aameri. **Term:** Summer. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine:** A.

* This course is fun I would say. It’s a theory course and a lot of it seems contrived at first (correctness stuff) but it does spark curiosity for “real” CS. The test and problem sets are not hard just start early, like always. I found the prof to be pretty good but some of my friends say she’s a bit boring.

# Year 2 (2020-2021)

**CSC207:** Software Design. **Prof:** Jonathan Calver. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A+.

* Honestly this course is a sort of useless. I guess it does introduce you to more rigorous software engineering practices but I find it to be a little bit contrived. It is useful in the sense that you learn collaborative coding. Speaking of, you’ll need a good team. I guess this is just fundamental software dev stuff that you just gotta push through. You also learn… Java... The prof is fine, but I feel the course doesn’t provide opportunity for him to shine. More discussion:

**CSC209:** Software Tools and Systems Programming. **Prof:** Karen Reid. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A+.

* This course is awesome. It really introduced me to what kind of work I wanted to do. Although the course is a “intro to C” course the type of stuff you need to consider and learn is quite fun i.e. memory models, pointers, sockets, etc. Assignments are very fun (KNN, chat client/server) and not too long but still just start early. Karen is an amazing professor as well.

**CSC258:** Computer Organization. **Prof:** Steve Engels. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** A-. **Mine**: A+.

* Overall great course. Super interesting stuff related to hardware if you’re into it (I am). Unfortunately the course was taught with Logisim due to being online and I didn’t get to learn Verilog and work with hardware in person. Hopefully that’s changed. The final project is absurd. I wrote roughly 5k lines of assembly… Start early. the final was fair and assignments/labs were easy. Steve is a great prof too. More discussion:

**CSC263:** Data Structures and Analysis. **Prof:** Michelle Craig. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A-.

* Tbh I didn’t enjoy this course too much. It’s obviously very very important for internships/jobs but I just didn’t like it that much. I did find some of the data structures very cool though like AVL trees but mostly due to the theoretical results. The assignments are easy but very very long, so, you guessed it, start early. Overall decent course, good content. Professor was decent as well.

**CSC369:** Operating Systems. **Prof:** David Lion. **Term:** Summer. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A+.

* Probably top 5 course at this school. Super fun course. I chose my career path because of this course (perhaps it was more so 367). You’ll hear horror stories of this course but I think if you enjoy systems, and you start assignments early, this course is amazing. It’s core CS, very important for jobs as well. Please make sure to have a good partner for the assignments (my partner did nothing, literally 0 lines of code). It is totally doable alone, if you start early (do so regardless). Prof was awesome, he was a PhD student and very very helpful. More discussion:

**MAT237:** Multivariable Calculus with Proofs. **Prof:** Asif Zaman. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A.

* Taught by the goat again. This course is a bit daunting at face value. But I truly think if you like math you’ll enjoy this course. I really enjoyed it. A lot of previous discussion that goes much more in depth:

**STA257:** Probability and Statistics I. **Prof:** Katherine Daignault. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: B-.

* Avoid this course. Especially if you’re in CS. This course is the worst course I took at this school and it’s not close. I felt the prof didn’t really teach content for the tests. Content wasn’t rigorous at all and yet the tests asked for crazy proofs. I think I spent less time later on in this course because it really started to be not what I hoped for, and so my marks went down. I don’t want to blame the prof entirely but I think with better instruction/course structure it would have been fun. Not sure if things have changed. The class average after the final was around a 50. She had to curve it up by 20%. Take that as you will. Some discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1499xvm/taking\_mat237\_sta257\_csc207\_csc236\_csc258\_in\_one/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1499xvm/taking_mat237_sta257_csc207_csc236_csc258_in_one/)

**FSL321:** Intermediate French III. **Prof:** Michaël Friesner. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A-. \*This course no longer exists. Take FSL320/322. More in the links below.\*

* I took French for 8 years before taking this. I took the placement and ended up in this course. I like languages so I enjoyed it. It was supposed to be a “fun” course for me and it was. Classroom like setting, I assume even more so in person so it was really unfortunate I couldn’t take it in person. Prof was pretty great. More discussion (on course content) here:

**ENV200:** Assessing Global Change: Science and the Environment. **Prof:** Karen Ing. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** C+. **Mine**: A-.

* Bird course. I did 0 readings, barely studied, and did well. Midterms were multi choice, final was essay. Prof is fine. More discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/s76fll/env200\_with\_karen\_ing/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/s76fll/env200_with_karen_ing/)

**PHL245:** Modern Symbolic Logic. **Prof:** Jared Riggs. **Term:** Summer. **Delivery:** Online. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A.

* Bird course if you’ve taken 165 or some other rigorous math course. The assignments are all very easy and final was easy too. Hardly studied for this course. Prof is fine.

# Year 3 (2021-2022)

**CSC301:** Introduction to Software Engineering. **Prof:** David Jorjani. **Crs Avg:** A-. **Mine**: A.

* This is course is practically a self learning project based course. From what I’ve heard it has changed a bit, but if you know web dev this course is a breeze. Especially if you have a good team. So maybe learn some JS and some frameworks before if you feel like it. Prof is pretty good but doesn’t teach much since again it’s just a self learning course.

**CSC311:** Introduction to Machine Learning. **Prof:** Roger Grosse. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* Overall this course is highly theoretical or fundamental ML. It’s quite good in my opinion. If you took 237 a lot of the math will be trivial. My friend that took 235 was lost for some of it. The assignments are quite easy with a lot of the math just being very very lengthy derivations, but the final was decently hard. Roger is a pretty good prof and the course is very well structured. Some AI course related discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/uylenl/calculus\_for\_robotics/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/uylenl/calculus_for_robotics/)

**CSC343:** Introduction to Databases. **Prof:** Daniel Heap. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* A decent course. It’s not that hard because you don’t do much I think. But it’s fundamental software dev so it’s nice to take it. You learn SQL and normalization and all that. Easy assignments and easy final. Daniel again, is a great prof. More discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/14k5u19/want\_thoughts\_and\_recommendations\_on\_my\_3rd\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/14k5u19/want_thoughts_and_recommendations_on_my_3rd_year/)

**CSC367:** Parallel Programming. **Prof:** Maryam Dehnavi. **Delivery:** Labs Online. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* This is probably my favourite course (tied with 469 IMO). It’s just super interesting course and I feel like it’s quite different from other courses. It is however probably the most time consuming CS course here. There are many assignments and each assignment requires a lot of work, massive research like report write-ups, on top of not being easy. The midterm was horrible my year (40% avg). No exam tho but big final project. Still such a fun and rewarding course. Highly recommend (even if it’s painful). Maryam was a great prof as well. Further discussion on it:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/v8tmsm/what\_are\_the\_most\_useful\_cs\_courses/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/v8tmsm/what_are_the_most_useful_cs_courses/)

**CSC384:** Introduction to Artificial Intelligence. **Prof:** Bahar Aameri. **Crs Avg:** A-. **Mine**: A+.

* Honestly I expected more from the course. The entire course is basically BFS with heuristics. Yes there is a bunch of theory, but it’s not that hard. I think it’s probably one of the easier courses offered here in 3rd year so take it for ease. I will say the assignments are fun. Final is kinda free. Bahar again is a good prof imo. More discussion:

**CSC324:** Principles of Programming Languages. **Prof:** Fan Long. **Delivery:** Labs Online. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A.

* This course is basically a Racket tutorial. I’ve heard they have switched to more Haskell which we also did, but it’s because in the later half of the course you learn actual programming theory concepts. Haskell is better for teaching those. Anyways, if you like functional programming it’s a pretty good course. I really liked the typing/type inference unit, but other than that the course is kinda uninteresting. Still easy tho. Assignments are not too bad, and exam was okay. Fan is a decent prof I would say. More disscussion:

**CSC373:** Algorithm Design, Analysis & Complexity. **Prof:** Karan Singh. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A+.

* Another core CS course. This is where algorithms get super interesting. I liked this course a lot. Probably top 5 course. It is very difficult but content wise amazing. You basically just go through CLRS, so there are good resources to help you. So I do think it’s possible to get a very good grade, you just need to make sure to spend the time into the course. That being said, tests and final were absolutely brutal especially the final. Problem sets are hard so just start early. Karan is a pretty good prof. Some discussion:

**CSC385:** Microprocessor Systems. **Prof:** Mario Badr. **Crs Avg:** A-. **Mine**: A+.

* Another course with the goat. This course was more hardware focused than recent offerings. Mario has said he will separate this course into two, one with hardware the other with IOT dev stuff. Regardless, it’s a very fun course. You build your own project with the IOT device at the end. Super fun but just get a good partner and start early. I think Mario really makes the course great. Labs were optional research paper readings but also a lot of good discussion. The midterm and exam are not too bad as well. Highly recommend. Some dicussion:

**CSC401:** Natural Language Computing. **Profs:** Frank Rudzicz, Zining Zhu, Raeid Saqur. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A+.

* IMO the most dense course offered here. Extremely fast paced. You learn basically the entirety of NLP in this course. There’s 3 profs teaching you 3 different types of NLP. It’s crazy. However it is such an interesting course and super rewarding top 5 course I would say. There’s a lot of memes about the final being brutal which it was (due to density of material), but it’s still possible to do very well. The assignments are fairly easy. I learned about transformers (basically LLMs) before the GPT3 boom and it was cool to see it blow up after a year of me learning it. All three profs were great.

**PEY**. **Term:** Summer.

* I started my PEY during the summer and it was the start of my decline in brain function. I just gave up on everything tbh. Life seemed so pointless. Like where is all the stress? Exams? Problem sets? Just nothing after work. Pick up some hobbies, it’ll help. I will say, in terms of software dev my PEY experience was invaluable. I learned an insane amount. And it kinda set me on my desired career path. Money is nice too.

# Year 4 (2022-2023)

**PEY**. **Term**: Fall+Winter.

* Continued PEY. Took courses during it; 1 per term.

**CSC458:** Computer Networking Systems. **Prof:** Soheil Abbasloo. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A.

* I enjoyed this course. It is quite dense and the content is not super ground breaking but I think learning the details of networking and implementing stuff like routers, was super fun. The later half of the course was very interesting with SDNs. Exam and midterm were pretty hard but you get a cheat sheet. The prof is very good. More discussion:
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/14k5u19/want\_thoughts\_and\_recommendations\_on\_my\_3rd\_year/](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/14k5u19/want_thoughts_and_recommendations_on_my_3rd_year/)

**ECE568:** Computer Security. **Prof:** Courtney Gibson. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A+.

* I love computer security so this course was absolutely amazing. Super fun labs and assignments. I do think the assignments are hard even though the solutions are like 20 lines total. It’s just hacking things is not easy. So start early. Courtney is an amazing prof.

# Year 5 (2023-2024)

**CSC443:** Database System Technology. **Prof:** Niv Dayan. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* Top 3 course, top 3 prof. This course was super fun. I didn’t think it would be but building a database from scratch with some friends is an amazing experience. The actual content was very interesting too. Project based course so nothing too hard but you really need to make sure to start early for this one and have a good team. Exam and midterm were not too bad. Again, Niv is an absolute gem, super passionate and really wants to involve students in course content and his own research too.

**CSC463:** Computational Complexity and Computability. **Prof:** Shubhangi Saraf. **Crs Avg:** B+. **Mine**: A.

* The best CS theory course at this school IMO (aside from maybe 473 which I didn’t take). I personally really enjoyed the concepts in the course and it changed how I view computers/computation. It’s just such a fundamental aspect of our reality. Highly recommend. The prof is great but I’m sad I missed out on being taught by the legendary Stephen Cook himself.

**CSC469:** Operating Systems Design and Implementation. **Prof:** Angela Demke-Brown. **Crs Avg:** B. **Mine**: A.

* Tied with 367 for best course here. It’s an amazing course with very interesting content: VMs, distributed systems, detailed memory systems and a hell of a lot more. It is extremely dense and the assignments are very hard (2/3 of my assignments only kinda maybe somewhat worked, but marking turns out to be pretty lenient). But I think it’s so rewarding and in hindsight you make/do some amazing stuff (fault tolerant KV store, memory allocator, etc). Exam and midterm were both brutal. The course was slightly disorganized but I think overall Angela is an amazing prof, and quite accommodating. I really enjoyed the course and highly recommend it even tho it’s hard.

**CSC488:** Compilers and Interpreters. **Prof:** Fan Long. **Crs Avg:** A-. **Mine**: A+.

* Honestly, this course is kind boring. I expected more. It’s not very interesting but I do think it was nice to build our own compiler. I’m not sure, I just thought it would be more. Not a very hard course and exam was pretty easy. This offering, I found the course to be extremely disorganized. It seemed like the TAs and profs didn’t communicate and the TAs had full control of the assignments causing some weird disconnect at times. Take it for fun since it isn't to hard. As mentioned Fan is a decent prof.

**EAS120:** Modern Standard Japanese I. **Prof:** Jisuk Park. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A-.

* I mentioned I was into language, so I decided to take this for fun. It’s a lot of work. I mean a lot. But it’s not difficult work. Make sure to keep up and really practice as much as you can. I guess it’s just how it goes with language courses. Super fun though. Again it’s more of a high school classroom setting so you can make some good friends here. Park Sensei is an absolutely amazing top tier prof. Super nice and fun to talk to. I recommend it if you like languages. Some discussion:

**EESA06H3:** Introduction to Planet Earth. **Prof:** Kirsten Kennedy. **Delivery:** Online Asynchronous. **Crs Avg:** B-. **Mine**: A+.

* It’s honestly not a bad course. It’s a bit boring later on IMO but it’s pretty easy. The midterm and exam is 100 multi choice with aid sheet. Pretty free. Prof is pretty good.

# FAQ

**Time management:** If you didn’t notice, but you need to start studying/doing assignments early. CS is a very workload and assignment heavy degree. You need to keep up. Regardless of degree, learning to manage your time is imperative.

**Laptop for CS:** literally doesn’t matter. Look at your other use cases. Care about battery? Build quality? Mac. Gaming? Legacy/Abundant software? Windows. No need to go super expensive but again it depends on your other use cases. UofT won’t ask you to run Crisis 3 even in CS. Even if you need to run a million n-body simulation (CSC367) you have the teaching labs (in 367 you have supercomputer access).

**Course loads:** I recommend 4 “real” courses + 1 bird/elective/“easier” course or just 4 courses per term. To make up for this, take courses over the summer if you can afford it/have time for it. This strategy will just help you keep your sanity and your grades won’t suffer. It'll also just make your time here more enjoyable.

**PEY:** The only advice I can give you is to take courses during PEY if you can afford it. It will seriously make 4th year a breeze. In terms of getting a job: try to do LeetCode, curate your resume for the position, present yourself well during interviews (meaning talk and dress well), and lastly pray to God they give you the job. In other words, idk lol.

**Friends:** Please try to make friends. I mean really try. A lot of people are socially awkward here or are very reserved, but even if this is you, just talk to the person next to you please. It’ll make your time and the other persons time at uni 100x more enjoyable. Don’t worry about being cringe, seriously, no one cares. Also join clubs to make friends.

Agree with most of the stuff here. But for CSC367 I had a completely opposite experience. I took it in 2022-2023 winter and it’s taught by someone else (I don’t remember the name). He’s got moderate accent, sometimes it can be hard for me to figure out what he’s saying, but that’s the least thing I’m worrying while i was taking the course.

I felt students’ time were not being respected by the teaching staff. There’s this mandatory lab you have to complete by Monday evening and the teaching team refuse to release it more than 12 hrs or so prior to the deadline. The reasoning for that is they’ve seen students in the past pulled it off so there’s no reason they should relax it a bit to make it easier for us to manage. I’m aware that they want us to finish it during three 1hr tutorial, but sometimes it may just get a bit confusing and we may not be able to get it done during that time. Oftentimes i have to skip dinner first to rush out the assignment after finish a whole day worth of lectures. I find it hard to understand why they wouldn’t just release it a bit earlier so we can at least take a read and do some preparations to make it easier to get things done in time.

And Scinet(the server we use to run and test assignments) goes off irregularly for a day or two, and the teaching staff indicated that no accommodation would be given for any assignments miss or late for this reason. So if you planned to do the assignment on a certain day and Scinet is down, you gotta throw your entire time schedule out of the window. In my case, although they did give 2 days extensions to the assignments, the fact that this kind of statement exists makes me feel my time is not being respected here.

Also the instruction for the assignments and labs are really confusing for me. My brain literally froze when I first saw the first assignment. I just learned memory hierarchy and now I gotta figure out how to test out the number of levels and speed of each of them for the cpu we’re working on programmatically. I tried really hard on it but only got 40% at the end. I also remember there’s a lab that tells you to implement hashtable, the instructions did not specify the methods you need to use to deal with collision so I used open addressing for simplicity, and of course i got 0 at the end cuz tests assume you were doing chaining for the collision.

I dropped the course immediately after seeing the results of a1. I don’t think it’s cuz I’m dumb or sth cuz I almost got A+ in CSC369 and i really liked that course. I was hoping to learn more about computer systems from this course, but sadly, this one has let me down and left a really bad taste in my mouth.",comment,2

You really need to keep up. The course moves quickly I would say and it’s not something you can ignore; every chapters builds up something for the next.

Every other day we got a quiz based on some reading we had to do. Don’t do this quiz haphazardly. Really understand the concepts in the reading and move forward. Don’t understand? Ask a friend. They don’t know? Ask a TA. If you can keep up with truly understanding a concept you will have no problem in the course. A good indicator of your level of understanding is if you are able to explain the concept to someone in first year or even younger.

Aside from this hard focus on problem sets. They are meant to make you struggle and learn the material. Spend as much time as needed doing them. Ask TAs for help if needed. If your friend does a question truly understand what they did. If you can do this you’ll be good for tests. Also they’ll give you additional practice problems. Do all of them if you can. Seriously.

This is what I did and ended with that mark. Good luck :)",comment,8

I found the course so fun and rewarding. I think I understated how hard the course is tho. It requires an insane amount of time IMO.

I will say the first assignment is kinda absurd. They do throw you into it a bit. I found it to be the hardest assignment out of all of them. Office hours did help though. 

We also had the 1h lab and the release being close to lab time. But I didn’t find it too bad tbh. Maybe our TAs were better?

Totally agree with the SciNet going down issue. At least they accommodate somewhat. But I think this only exasperates how much you need to dedicate time into the course and to start very early. 

Definitely not for the faint of heart and totally agree the course has a bunch of logistical issues. I didn’t find it too bad. Also it seems like a trend, upper year courses just aren’t as well organized as lower years.

So 1 theory and 1 programming course per term. Then add 258 to whatever term is lighter since this course is very heavy especially due to the final project. You’ll have math and some stats along side these and then throw in a bird course or two. If you feel like it add a third year course as well. 

But you need to gauge your decision according to your interests. Maybe an all theory term is easy or an all coding term is easy for you. Have a look at my course load advice at end of the post as well.",comment,2

In general 137 will completely re-teach you calculus from the ground up. So all you really need to succeed is an interest for math with a very strong work ethic. Make sure to ask help as often as possible. But I can give you a sneak peek:

You can have a look at Tyler Holden’s (a former prof) notes here: http://home.tykenho.com/index.html?notes They are a bit older but it’ll give you an overview. 

Also have a look at the YouTube playlists by late professor Alfonso Garcia-Saz: https://m.youtube.com/@mat1378/playlists

People have commitments, lifestyles, and different study habits. So I can tell you what worked for me but it may not work for you.

My defining strategy is start early. It’s almost annoying how much I’ve said it at this point but seriously. For example, every single time I’ve opened and read a problem set on the first day, I’ve found that I’ve never really struggled with that problem set. I get accustomed to the questions and if I have some immediate idea I can think about it right away. Point is I have literally the maximum amount of time to work on something and almost always it is more than enough. I can think about the problem over a couple weeks rather than a few days.

Secondly, thinking about problems and typing things up are two completely different things. You need to set some time maybe 1-2 days to just grind and type the whole thing up. Do this early so you have time to look over your work.

You can do this iteratively. Think about the problem, then type it out i.e. type part or the whole solution for the question/implement a single function for a programming assignment. Look over your work. Think some more. Then think about the next thing. Repeat.

Point is, spend most of your time thinking, and not writing garbage. Write something solid and leave time to think some more. That’s it. You won’t get it right the first time around but that’s why you start early.",comment,2

Could I know more how you were able to handle such heavy course load? MAT237 was only one course and it seems you dedicated a lot of time with it. How did you organize yourself with all the heavy courses that equally demanded so much attention?

Also from your answer I can gather having friends to go through the material with is important. Did you do study groups? I usually start asking people once I hit a question I can’t answer but did you instead, for example, sit down with friends and asked questions as you went through a problem set together?",comment,1

I definitely don’t regret trying to get these grades, but at the same time I could have just taken it easy. I guess it was more just the mentality to get the best mark I could for every course I took. And I enjoyed learning things to a somewhat higher degree. Also I had intention of going into grad school, not so much now. Then again I coulda just chilled/went out more lol. No regrets.",comment,5

It’s true other courses can get heavy but, it’s hard to beat the investment required for 237, so not all courses are as demanding as this one.

Regardless, even if it was all just as bad it’s still doable (although it might be hell). I made another comment just below where someone wanted clarification on what I actually did to manage my time: https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/s/IPVuD0ok7Q. To summarize, small incremental additions that you do right away is key. It’s easier to manage. You also retain information a a lot better this way (spaced learning and all that). Have a look at that comment.

I did not have study groups. The idea follows from my style of time management. Me and friends do a little work, we see some problem or approach we don’t know how to solve or understand and then we discuss. If the problem is serious we get together in person. If only one person had an issue we make sure the other actually understands the issue, continuing to ask each other the approach/issue until we do. So similar to your style but maybe much more consistently and frequently. The idea being every iteration everyone knows what’s going on. That being said, I have done it a few times, where I physically sat down with my friends and just finished complete problems set questions within a few hours. It’s fun to do that too. It’s just convenient for everyone do things incrementally on their own time and often come together to tough base. Hope that makes sense.",comment,1

Overall this looks pretty good imo. Good order too.

I think your second term is going to be hell on earth if you don’t have good partners/teams for 369/443. These two courses are a huge huge time sink just because of the length of the projects. Not terribly hard I would say but a lot of time goes into them so please be mindful of that and please get some friends to take the course with you if you can. 401 will be your toughest I think so make sure to keep up. 

First term looks great. 3 relatively straightforward courses (209/301/343). 311 is only slightly harder and 373 being very hard. Overall manageable term.",comment,2

However each of these fields can also be abstracted to the point where it doesn’t matter. For example my position specifically deals with container resource management. I don’t deal with hardware but you still need to understand it. Each of these can also be not so abstracted, there’s another team that deals with bare metal stuff, so they need to know a lot more.

I didn’t do any real prep. Mat137 gave us this “pre-calculus quiz” just to brush up on algebra basically. But that’s it.

I was gonna say this third year is pretty tough lol. Similar in difficulty to what I did. But this is great. I’m sure you can gauge the stats courses better that you’ll add on.

Just because of my own interest I would recommend you try 469 or 458 if you’re up for it. The only reason I say that is so you don’t regret not taking them since this is your only chance (that’s just my mindset). Amazing courses imo.

Regardless, looks great and good luck :)",comment,2
