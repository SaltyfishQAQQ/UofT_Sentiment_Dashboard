PALESTINIANS have the right to their own indigenous land. They have been massacred since the Nakba. Your people have been forcing innocent people out of their homes for almost 100 years now. What do you have to say about that?? Or are you are only good for saying Zionism isn’t bad! You are lying! No we are innocent! Typical victim mentality bullshit.",comment,0

Literally everything you've said so far is a projection. You haven't addressed a single point I made in my previous comment; in fact, I'm convinced you haven't even bothered to read it. You just jumped straight to the reply button to repeat the same racist, pro-terrorist bullshit you've already spouted.",comment,0

you’re genuinely insane. what i linked says at least 35,562 people were killed and i linked something else that says it might be even higher. you want to discredit me because i said 40,000+? okay, my mistake. i’ll say 35,562 palestinians killed since october 7th. now what do you have to say? is it okay now that all these people have died, or is your head so far up your own ass that you can’t admit this is a genuine issue?",comment,1
