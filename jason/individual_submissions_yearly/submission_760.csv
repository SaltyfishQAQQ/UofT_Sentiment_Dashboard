I'm about to be a BComm grad in April 2025, so naturally I'm starting to plan what to do after grad. To be honest I would love to leave Toronto; while I love the cultural diversity & opportunities it offers, I'm ready to try living somewhere else where my rent doesn't cost 90% of my paycheque.

Has any recent grads been able to successfully find a job outside of Ontario and leave? Right now I'm considering moving to Edmonton (for a number of reasons I'm not going to explain, cost and quality of living being the top priority). If so, do you have any tips on what really helped?

Hoping a UofT degree will help, but I know the job market right now is sh\*t everywhere so I'm not overly hopeful or anything. Just want to get out of here, so I'd appreciate if anyone who has any experience leaving the GTA would be willing to share.",submission,23

It‚Äôs gonna be easier to get a job in Toronto or the GTA since that‚Äôs where your connections are gonna be, but you can get a job by applying online if you do a shitload of those

Also, while there are many jobs outside of Toronto, keep in mind that they might pay less. Your rent to income ratio matters a lot more than the number on paper",comment,13

Even smarter given you‚Äôre coming out with a bcom and haven‚Äôt given in to the Bay Street propaganda that there‚Äôs no jobs for you outside Toronto.

I moved from Edmonton to come to U of T over a decade now. I won‚Äôt say I regret it because I met my wife and started a family here, but it has been very humbling to see everyone I grew up with and did my undergrad with back in Edmonton. What I‚Äôve accomplished (house, kids, 6 figure salaries, vacations, etc) at 35 they accomplished at 25.

It‚Äôs a great city you can do well in. The job market is never as bad out there as it is here. You could start applying now and get something lined up and employers will give you time to move.",comment,8

I‚Äôve never been one of those Wall Street finance ppl, work life balance is much more important to me. 

I‚Äôve applied to a few jobs and they were like ‚Äúapply when you‚Äôre abt to graduate‚Äù, but most of my friends who‚Äôve already graduated say they had jobs lined up already a year before they graduate so I‚Äôm kinda confused. I‚Äôll just keep applying and try not to get discouraged hahaha

Just out of curiosity, did you like living in Edmonton? How is it compared to Toronto? I know we have a lot more stuff going on here but honestly my bf and I aren‚Äôt a huge fan of the hustle culture and busy-ness of Toronto, so we‚Äôre thinking even though there‚Äôs ‚Äúless to do‚Äù in Edmonton we‚Äôd actually love it there.

Its gonna be more competitive given you'll be an international hire but just apply, apply, apply. And the USA has 100x as many jobs as we do here in Canada. It may be a long waiting time and process (figuring out visa logistics and such) but if cost of living and money is primarily what you care about, the USA is your best bet. Literally the exact same jobs in the US pay so much more than they do here in Canada and let's be real, cost of living in Canada is getting so high, it is expected to surpass cost of living in the USA or has already surpassed in some places (like Toronto)  
And if you want to stay in Canada, just apply everywhere else outside of Ontario. Honestly, with a UofT degree I genuinely believe you'll easily find a job outside of Ontario. I know many people who graduated from unis in the GTA and moved out with job offers, but they said they had to apply A LOT of jobs (100+ applications). Stay optimistic and you'll find something.",comment,3

It honestly it has everything Toronto has, just less of it. Nice restaurants, museums, galleries, parks, people to be friends with, it‚Äôs all there. The river valley is a gem.

But really the benefit there is affordability. Maybe rent for a year or two but after that a nice house with a backyard and space for hobbies is well within reach. Taxes are lower, healthcare is more accessible. 

Obviously it‚Äôs got crime and things like that but I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a better place you can end up in this country if you‚Äôre looking to live well and opt out of the rat race that people you graduated with will be grinding at their whole working lives.",comment,2
