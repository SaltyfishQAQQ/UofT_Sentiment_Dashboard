them: **hi there**  
me: hi ü§®, how's your day been?  
*ignores what I said and goes straight to ranting about transit for around 5 minutes* (they were a transit employee)  
them: so where you from?  
me: Canada, Toronto  
them: ohhh I had some really smart friends go to university of Toronto, one for dentistry, have you heard of it?  
me: yeah i go there  
them: Oh my God, so you're a genius üòØ you go to the oxford of the north!  
me: oh... is that what its called? certainly doesn't feel the student body matches the name  
them: yeah it is called that üò§, alot of them come here to work for those big tech companies

and then it just continued to more ranting about transit, but this time about transit software. I always thought it was an in-school meme but I guess somehow it leaked to the outside world üíÄ

The transit software rant was pretty interesting. They had a bug with the hybrid system on buses where the bus would just freak it and you'd have to turn the entire bus off/on. So the software peeps fixed the bug which introduced a new bug that would just make the antilock braking system go haywire. So the transit peeps said we'll take the old bug tbh. Montreal apparently was offered to buy the same busses but opted for different ones?",submission,192
