If they wanted to pass you, they probably would’ve given you a 50 to barely pass the course. 

Obviously best bet, ask them anyways. Let them know you would like to see if its possible to redo assignments, quizzes or any exams to get your mark up 4pts. Maybe they will work something out. Again, chances are low, but in your position, anything is worth a shot.

Also make sure you ask in a polite manner and give a compelling reason for your poor performance.",comment,96

You can ask just in case and maybe for a redo of an assignment or quiz but your chances are slim.,comment,22

One of my profs went through everyone with mid to high 40s to judge whether to bump, without students even asking. Some profs will tell you no, or straight not reply to your email, but it doesn't hurt to ask imo.

Also some faculty/departments offer exam re-grade which you can try. Not all of them get processed, but it also doesn't hurt to submit a request.",comment,6

If it was already a passing grade, it would be worth inquiring whether an increase is acceptable. 

If you are given a failing grade, it’s because in the grader’s estimation the work does not deserve a passing grade.

The only case in which I would inquire is if it was a TA who gave you the grade - then ask the prof for a review of your work.

If it was the prof who gave you the grade, then no - don’t even ask.",comment,3
