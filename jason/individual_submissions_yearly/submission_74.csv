Fun fact at some point in high school a teacher called me out for being distracted by a girl bc he saw my grades drop suddenly, he was right. Now my friends question if I am gay(I am not)",submission,294

While probably not super relatable, I had a similar experience to you when I was like 14~21 ish (just coming out of it now over the last year and a half ish). It wasn't related to academics or anything but I went through some turbulent stuff. Anyways, I used to consider myself as someone who was both hyper romantic and sexual, (still do, just working on getting it back) but then I stopped having interest in either, like completly, and this was a big frustration for me for a while, especially since it was during the years when we consider these feelings are supposed to be kinda peak.

Anyways, it's been getting better. But, hate to be saying it, but you might have a ""secret depression"", where everything feels fine, but everything is actually not. If you feel numb generally, it might be a sign of that. It doesn't get better by itself though. It help's to use self help books to navigate you through it. It seems tacky, but it's worth it. Besides, there's no science for how to solve these things anyways, so you're pretty much gonna have to accept that you're gonna have to bullshit your way through this. One that really helped me was the untethered soul by Micheal A Singer.

I believe in you brother. You will feel horny and corny again.",comment,5

And the impossible pursuit of academic validation has completely made me forget that relationships can be had. I forgot talking to people is an option when I’m on campus.

Theoretically, the OnlyFans market should not exist. There's this girl Sophie Rain that made $43 million this year...Don't think that's all teen/ado money, highly unlikely. Man, what are we doing in university? lol...I won't even make a fraction of $43 million over my entire lifetime.",comment,3

In response to your post, how do you feel about having recently lost the motivation or drive to pursue connections (romantic, physical, emotional, etc.) with members of the opposite sex? Do you find it troubling or are you concerned because you are feeling indifferent towards this shift within you?",comment,1
