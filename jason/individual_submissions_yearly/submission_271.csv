I agree that grades are inflated and it's hard to tell, but standardised testing doesn't allow students to learn how to think creatively and critically. And those are qualities universities want. 

Schools teach a curriculum that is not even right for higher post education. I was stuck in that myself, barely passing when it came to essay writing in high school because I wrote for myself. At  U of T my first year I got high 70s, after that not one essay under 80%

My school was one of the only schools in the area that tried to regulate/deflate scores in my senior year. It caused basically widespread panic and stress. The school hired some new teachers who were used to college grading scales—ie they failed 1/4 the class, gave closer to 90% average for students who really tried, which is still inflated, but these are people expecting a 98% elsewhere and competing against students with 98% in other schools. Needless to say, there were some student protests, angry student meetings with the principal to change the unreasonable marking standards, and after every test/assignment grade came out the whole class would line up to ask why their grade was so low. Everyone was worried that no one would get into a decent university like uoft because all the other highschools handed out 95-98. I think, in my particular case, uoft picked up on what was going on because I got in with a considerably lower average than friends in other schools who were rejected. But this probably can’t be expected to happen with every school. And high school kids get very aggressive when the school is ruining their college chances. Even the hardheaded new teachers were pressured to change their grading by 3rd semester. 

You simply can’t enforce grade deflation, because it selectively disadvantages only the people who listen. No one wants to be the batch to maybe get filtered out due to lacklustre scores. Some schools/teachers will just continue the inflation and you can’t prove they aren’t just all exceptional. Unless we introduce standardized testing there’s no practical way that any deflation will ever happen. ",comment,1
