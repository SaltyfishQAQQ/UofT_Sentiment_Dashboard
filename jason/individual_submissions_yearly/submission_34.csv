* UofT profs hate flowery language, be direct
* If it flows well, your TA will be happy, that means you will get a good grade.
* Always ask yourself ""why?"" when writing an essay
   * Example:
   * Thesis: Chocolate is the best snack.
   * Why: Because it tastes good.
      * Why: Because it is sweet
   * Why 2: Because it is healthy
      * Why: Other options not as healthy
      * Why: Also made from plants.
   * Continue...
* What this means is that as long as you can answer ""why"", you will get a good grade.
   * Do not spend the word count of your essay padding it with useless information.",comment,54

Given limited space, it‚Äôs essential to be concise and direct. 

Start with a brief introduction‚Äîone or two lines should be enough to introduce the topic. Your thesis is here you need to focus. It should be clear and arguable, centered on the essay's main idea, and crafted to invite counterarguments. 

Each point in your argument should be direct and unambiguous. Avoid fillers; they dilute your position and suggest a lack of confidence. Instead, focus on supporting your thesis with concrete examples that boost your argument and persuade the reader to see your perspective.

Your claims should illustrate why your argument matters and should convince the readers to agree with you. 

Spend more time developing your conclusion than your introduction. In the conclusion, restate your thesis and succinctly summarize your main points. Conclusions can be fun (ish), unline in the intro, you can appeal to the readers, convincing them agree with your point.

Also, a thesaurus is going to be your best friend when writing an essay.

Remember to correctly use proper citations and footnotes where necessary; many cases of accusations of academic violation could have been avoided had there been proper citations!!

For example:

**Thesis**: *Romeo and Juliet* is not the best choice for teaching high school students about romantic tragedy.

* **Claim**: The themes are outdated and less relatable.
   * **Why**: The cultural context of family feuds and arranged marriages doesn‚Äôt resonate with modern students.
* **Claim**: The language is challenging and inaccessible.
   * **Why**: Shakespearean English requires extensive guidance, taking time away from exploring the themes of romantic tragedy.
* **Claim**: It romanticizes impulsive, reckless behaviour.
   * **Why**: Romanticizes reckless behaviours  
* **Claim**: There are better, more relatable alternatives.
   * **Why**: Contemporary novels and diverse cultural texts provide accessible examples of tragic romance.
* **Claim**: These alternatives reflect students‚Äô modern experiences and diverse backgrounds.
   * **Why**: Relevant texts can foster a deeper, more personal connection to the themes of love and loss.",comment,12

Though the chances of you getting a perfect score is practically zero.

Now for a midterm, you have the opportunity to get a perfect score, but the chances of you getting a good score are up in the air especially if they don't give you good study material. You can properly study and still get a 75% because you didn't study the right stuff, blanked on things you knew or have questions that were very different from the prep. 

That's why I prefer projects imo. Especially ones with clear criteria. I have a lot more control on how well I do.",comment,1
