How do I keep going after fumbling exams aaaaaaaaa,Expensive_Injury7315,1h8v7cu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h8v7cu/how_do_i_keep_going_after_fumbling_exams_aaaaaaaaa/,1733586392.0,"So basically I just had my first exam, messed up \*big\* time. 

Not sure what exactly happened, I just had a couple slip-ups. It was a 50%\~ final. Honestly, I'm just very disappointed - I knew all the course material, preformed stellar in the previous assessments, spent over 20 hours in preparation and I don't even know what went wrong. But bottom line my average in the course is probably going to drop 30% after this exam. 

I have a couple more exams to write and now I'm more worried about the upcoming ones where I don't have the same pre-final average.  It's like someone just vacuumed all of my motivation. 

Does anyone have tips to avoid thinking about this?",submission,23

I don't even remember how my exam went.

maybe it's bad advice if you're behind on studying for future exams. if you have the time, just do something fun until you forget. it's like fuelling a vehicle.",comment,18
