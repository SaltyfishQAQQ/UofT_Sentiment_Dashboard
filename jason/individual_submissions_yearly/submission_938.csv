Should I continue to live with my roommate next year?,Honest-Standard1949,1gyynwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gyynwl/should_i_continue_to_live_with_my_roommate_next/,1732475116.0,"Hi guys! I have a very serious question that doesn't sound very much serious and I need help with that. To give you some context - first year student here, I live with a friend near Bay and share the same bathroom. 
The question is, should I still live with my roommate next year? 
At this point I might be picky so I really wanted to get your opinions to see if I am still rational to make this decision. 

He
- leaves dirty dishes in the sink or at the living room
- doesn't clean up his own mess (some of his food literally lying on the ground and on the stovetop)
- doesn't flush the toilet sometimes after taking a dump or piss
- doesn't pay rent on time
- doesn't clean up the living room or the bathroom (I do the cleaning for the living room
- causes as much noise as he can

However, he
- is one of my best friends
- is hilarious

I am also the one paying less rent so if I don't continue to live with him next year it is going to be annoying to find another roommate and secure a good deal.
