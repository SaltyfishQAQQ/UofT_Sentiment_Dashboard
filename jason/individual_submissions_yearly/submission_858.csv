Is commuting to EngSci worth it?

I feel like commuting is better cause I‚Äôll save a ton of money. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong

I have 2 options

1. Live at chestnut residence

Pros: Apparently I will have a better social life if I live in res. Idk if this is true.

Cons: u can‚Äôt open your windows, the food is mid, and you gotta walk 20 minutes to get to the engineering building. Price is also $ 20k / year

2) Commute

Pros: Family saves around $12k per year (it will probably cost me 1-2k $ per year to commute and my parents will also have to spend money to feed me). I can also study on the train (meaning my commute is not entirely a waste of time).

Cons: the commute is 1 hour 20 minutes from my place to UofT. This consists of a 50 min train ride.",submission,19

It really depends what you prioritize.  I don‚Äôt think the money difference really matters in the long run compared to the experience difference you get of living at home vs residence.  

Eng sci is pretty hard and chestnut‚Äôs location promotes skipping class. It‚Äôs the furthest from campus compared to other residences, so you will be more reluctant to get up for lectures in the winter.  

At least living at home, even if the commute is tough, you will probably attend all lectures due to family pressure.  None of this pressure exists when living in chestnut. 

The major advantage of chestnut was that there were so many Eng scis around you that it‚Äôs easy to make study groups.  Being able to always work on problem sets together if needed because another Eng sci is only an elevator ride away is useful.",comment,17

I did a 1 hour and 15 min commute for a year, in a program not nearly as difficult as yours, and it was my worst year for sure. Commuting is severely mentally exhausting, especially in your first year where you‚Äôre adjusting to everything. 

If you don‚Äôt want chestnut due to the price, I would really recommend Campus Co-operative Residence. I currently lived there and it‚Äôs awesome. I live like 2 min walk from campus, and the rent is between 500-800 dollars a month. Email them as soon as possible because spots fill up quickly for the academic year.

Besides that, you have other options cheaper than Chestnut such as Tartu residence.

If you‚Äôre unable to get into any of the residences and have to commit to chestnut to have residence downtown, I would still recommend that as it‚Äôs still WAY BETTER than commuting. Avoid commuting like the plague, especially in first year. 

I‚Äôve done it all, uoft rez, off-campus, commuting from home, trust me on this

Edit: I know that most engineers live in chestnut, but you still have the option of applying to live in the residences of colleges (such as University college, St Michael‚Äôs college, etc). It‚Äôs likely that College residences will prioritize members of that college, but I think it‚Äôs worth applying and getting on the waitlist, as people tend to drop out once the year starts. 
When you live in college residences, they‚Äôre basically the same price as chestnut, but they‚Äôre on-campus which is better than the 20 minute walk",comment,5

I did engsci from 2015-2019 and I can say pretty much every problem in my life rn can be traced back to my decision to commute. Not even being dramatic and my other engsci 1t9 commuter friends can corroborate.  It will take a massive chunk of time out of your days - not just the hours spent commuting but the hours spent dealing with the fatigue. Not to mention how unreliable the TTC can be. Engsci is literally designed to push you to your limits - there‚Äôs just no time to deal with commuting unless you want your mental health and/or academic performance to suffer. Since you‚Äôre considering Engsci, I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre a very keen student - your energy should be focused on growing intellectually and caring for yourself. Undergrad is a crucial period in your life for learning and getting opportunities - you want to put your best foot forward and nurture your mental health as much as you can.

Or does it just mean mild discomfort?

It absolutely impacts your social life and that is a huge part of uni. It also affects your grades to commute and not to have a strong social circle, for example you won‚Äôt do late night study sessions. It also can affect networking. Stronger friend groups = better networks to find jobs later on. 

The only way to make up for lack of socializing is to spend an enormous amount of time and effort participating in clubs, associations etc (which can be hard if you have to commute there)

However bear in mind that even socializing at uni necessarily involved spending money. 

But if your family is from a less well-off background, those aren‚Äôt necessarily good enough to justify putting them in dire straits. For example if they have other kids to think of, or whatever. But if you‚Äôre just feeling guilty about it even though it doesn‚Äôt impact them that much, then live in residence 100% or find a friend to share an apartment with at least

I also agree with everyone that attending class is way harder with that commute. I did it and ended up moving downtown cos of how hard it was",comment,3

Honestly, it's a lot of money but I do think it's worth it. You may be pulling late nights, and commuting late SUCKS. and you may miss study sessions that classmates have, and have less time to do assignments if your commute is that long.

There are other residences you can apply to as well, and apartments, and off-campus housing. Chestnut is okay, the food is meh but it's manageable and I bonded with the people there about it. The rooms are actually pretty nice, although I am biased because I got a single room due to being an upper-year. You can try it for a year, or try somewhere else closer to campus for a year.

I'm not in engineering, but I know a LOT of engscis whose first year kicked their asses. You will need somewhere a little closer, I think, to handle that.",comment,1
