How is the PEY/ASIP search going? Sharing my experience :),mrdanda,1g70xxo,https://i.redd.it/uafbfeaq2nvd1.png,1729311427.0,"Hello! 

I recently finished my PEY search and wanted to share my experience, especially for any new engineering (or other PEY/ASIP) students looking for advice!

I've added an image that shows my search, which might look a lot different from others. I am a computer/electrical engineering student, and I've taken to the niche of Analog Electronics. 

Since first year I have been trying to get connections and networking, so that is something I would highly recommend. Also, I unfortunately started my job search a bit late, so one of my main connections, my research professor, was unfortunately less lucrative than it could have been. 

My final job offer came from a connection I made at the YNCN career fair, where I met a manager for the exact job I wanted, so I was a little lucky. He wanted to interview me because of my enthusiasm and I ended up getting the Job!

My other offer was from a friend I made on Reddit, where I made a post asking about certain upper year courses that had very little information. She ended up being on the hiring team for her group, and I was lucky enough to have an interview with her and her director that went well.

My final interview was with the company my professor works with the closest, and unfortunately I didn't get an offer. I was in close contact with my professor the whole time and he told me that I really impressed the company with my resume, my interview skills, but my GPA was lacking, currently around 2.9. 

If there's some advice I can give to any future students applying for internships, it's to network early! Don't be shy to talk to professors especially about their work. I did 2 research summers in 1st and 2nd year, so it definitely pays off, and I would recommend the experience! You can see from my chart that I only got interviews from connections, so career those are really important . Try to find a niche that is not oversaturated, but has some job security, in my example, analog electronics is something not a lot of people end up going into, but will always be relevant.",submission,54
