"I'm failing a course with zero chance of passing even if I take the exam, can I just skip it??",Apprehensive-Vast926,1cdlmi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cdlmi9/im_failing_a_course_with_zero_chance_of_passing/,1714138621.0,"This is my first time ever posting on Reddit but I honestly don't know who else to ask.

I've basically just realized that I am irreparably failing a prereq, even before taking the exam. I've had a lot of personal stuff happen this year and I didn't submit TWO (i know lol) major assignments which are worth 20% and 30% respectively, meaning I've already failed the course and will receive a 0.0 GPA for it. 

I'm not looking for pity or anything because I know this is my own fault lol but the final is in like 4 hours. My grade is already screwed. Can I just not go? Will that affect my eligibility to potentially defer an exam in the future?

Once your gpa is fucked, it’s really hard to fix it. DO NOT take the exam. File a petition for late withdrawal, and fight for it. You already know that a fail is 0/4.0 on the gpa scale. 

For example if you were to take three courses, and get 3.7 on both, but fail one of them - then your gpa would be a 1.0. People telling you to take the exam are outright ridiculous.",comment,66

""Special note on completed courses: This petition is normally not granted if a student submitted the final assignment or wrote the final exam, and thus and completed the course. If you choose to finish the course, the Faculty will assume you have decided to accept the outcome despite the problems you experienced.""

You say you had personal things. You may have a case for a withdrawal without academic penalty

Late withdrawal (where it will be marked on your transcript as a late withdrawal) is also an option.

Contact your registrar.",comment,9

These things happen and it's great that you sound like you're taking this in stride and want to move forward.

You do have the option of skipping the exam altogether.  You could also show up, put your information on the exam, wait the required 30 minutes and then leave.  You could also show up and do your best, even if you know you're going to fail the course.  Your transcript will show your course mark no matter what and so I guess you're trying to figure out which you'd prefer to have on your transcript: 0 or 23 or ???  .  A 0 can be read as ""simply didn't bother"" but can also be read as ""had a rough semester/year"".  No matter what failing mark is there, you'd need to explain the situation going forward (rather than pretending it's not there because people can read) but people are usually quite understanding.

I have no clue if your not showing up is something that's kept in your file, in addition to your course mark.  That would have to do with whether emarks communicates that data to ROSI.  If you had more time, you could contact your registrar's office to ask?  I would imagine that not showing up, like failing, is something that can be discussed as needed when needed.  But I don't want to speculate because I don't know! :)

Personally, I would show up and take the exam and do my very best (assuming my brain and body allowed me to show up).  To some degree it's showing respect to the material, the course, your classmates, and the instructor.  And, for all you know, you'll do well enough in the exam that the instructor might ""accidentally"" pass you. Who knows?  :) :) :)",comment,21
