Am I just a weakling or is the water in the 2nd floor women's washroom in sid smith ridiculously hot?,deklension_kills,1d9ptqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d9ptqy/am_i_just_a_weakling_or_is_the_water_in_the_2nd/,1717699937.0,"Everytime I wash my hands in this washroom, it's a comfortable temperature until it warms up and then it's super hot. But by the time you wet your hands and then lather with soap, the water is already heated up and I have to switch to the next tap because I legit can't handle how hot it is.

The women's washrooms on the 1st floor and basement are fine though so I wonder if the men's washrooms or any of the upper floors have the same issue.",submission,15
