Love that. Hope they keep it this way for when I apply to cs this fall and post next the next year. I'd much rather have a lower chance at gambling getting accepted in stream, and to have a higher chance out of stream to prove my self. I'm sure many students will prefer this is as well ! 

Is it better to take 148 in the fall or winter?",comment,1
