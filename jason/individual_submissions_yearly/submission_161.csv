Bringing a calculator into an exam that doesn't allow one (yes, that includes exams where having a calculator wouldn't help), bringing a type of calculator that isn't allowed, leaving their pencil case on your desk, leaving their phone on their desk or in their pocket, etc. 

Not knowing what's allowed and what isn't is an easy way to commit an academic offense, and one that can be avoided just by reading the rules. 

So please, this time, can we all read the exam rules of conduct before the finals? 

Also avoid doing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/s/uBJ01qzaLR)",submission,167

I also say many many many times to have phones away and turned OFF, but inevitably someone‚Äôs phone will ALWAYS ring during the exam, and then I have to be THAT person who goes up to them and watches while they panickedly and awkwardly turn their phone off and put it awayü•≤ I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever actually written someone up for it if it just rings and I watch them turn it off put it away, and I‚Äôve never seen a chief presiding officer do it too. 

If you realize you have your phone on your person at the beginning of an exam, raise your hand and say you forgot it was on you and can you please put it away in front of them. Unless you have a dick head for a TA, you likely won‚Äôt get faulted, because no one who actually
plans to cheat asks to put it away, especially near the beginning (don‚Äôt quote me on it though, because technically they could write you up - I‚Äôve just never seen it if you do it this way). Do not try to put it away or even try to reach into your pockets or your bag without asking a TA or presiding officer, because THEN you can very much get written up for cheating. Goes for anything - if you need to grab a pencil from your pencil case in your bag, or your water bottle from your bag, ask a TA to watch you take it out. 

Also, TAs will be asked sometimes to check the washrooms for any hidden materials at the start of an exam. Don‚Äôt try to hide your notes there. lol",comment,16
