>Thank you for your patience over the last seven weeks as we have worked to resolve the encampment peacefully.  

>In my [June 9 message](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmx.technolutions.net%2Fss%2Fc%2Fu001.jxaZRujEt1lhE0WEp4QewKUxRjv0INt6P0-sPZO23OUzTOqwIptPl0tQbOxFEf7fy9UFjRpuzkp9uztUb5n-Vg%2F47c%2FWxNhCMMESvCWHr88qwYdXg%2Fh0%2Fh001.5UXFi_gAKf6Po2LxA3k4HGHxu3j_0ZsThqOWnPFHUh4&data=05%7C02%7Cjames.juras%40mail.utoronto.ca%7Cebf6c99f143145370b2008dc90ac8699%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C638544317858235889%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=hx80uZjV4K1P6QI1n34WM5JAOfROl0D1ickhCqYxYVU%3D&reserved=0), I outlined the principles that have guided our actions: neutrality on issues of scholarly debate, adherence to U of T’s policies and procedures in all our activities, inclusivity and democratic principles regarding the membership of University committees, and recognition of the fundamental right to protest. I also outlined the proposal we made to address encampment participants’ concerns.  

>There have been two important developments since my last message. 

>After a temporary pause in discussions, they were resumed after the University received a new proposal from the protesters yesterday afternoon to end the encampment. We responded with a counterproposal.  

>The University’s application for an injunction is being heard by the Ontario Superior Court this week. We are seeking to preserve the right to debate, disagree, and protest for all community members. If we are awarded an injunction, the encampment would be required by law to be dismantled within a set period of time. Encampment participants – along with all U of T community members – would be free to exercise their rights of free speech, protest, and continue advocating for their cause without erecting structures or occupying property overnight. The order before the court includes provisions for the Toronto Police Service to assist in carrying out the order to vacate King’s College Circle if necessary – something that TPS would only do if individuals do not comply with the injunction. Failure to comply may also result in discipline, including under the [Code of Student Conduct](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fmx.technolutions.net%2Fss%2Fc%2Fu001.Jg_sqgPJs1lCjHcCRsBB8WxdCB4VE1acdty2ywMZEV8ZUgittoQlet3F3m3Mgtn91rtCdZkvEPLS5u0rmwuQ9iz2qysk_ML9GenFjEZbchkUL_hwu4TpJhcyM1EWr7fPUEPa5Z5JzpTmyom0yuF2Ag%2F47c%2FWxNhCMMESvCWHr88qwYdXg%2Fh1%2Fh001.JLTRc6QjYfWQl4lWQROV-qowE4vv8ZPCaGu77Bf3ok0&data=05%7C02%7Cjames.juras%40mail.utoronto.ca%7Cebf6c99f143145370b2008dc90ac8699%7C78aac2262f034b4d9037b46d56c55210%7C0%7C0%7C638544317858248603%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C0%7C%7C%7C&sdata=iY8nDRAbi1w5GwjpuCA0K%2F5s3Ao72%2BrvaZfyCfDC4hA%3D&reserved=0).  

>We continue to pursue these parallel paths of dialogue and legal action. Our goal is still to secure a peaceful conclusion that returns Front Campus to the entire community and protects the rights of all community members to express themselves on the widest range of issues.

The University lawyers made the argument that the Charter doesn’t apply in Universities since the Universities are private spaces — that’s precisely why there’s a Student Code of Conduct. They cited several cases and court decisions in support of this position.

They also made the argument that even if the Charter (sec. 2 specifically) were to be applied, it has to be measured through sec. 1, which is the “reasonable limits” section, with it seeking to balance the rights of the individuals and interests of greater society. And that the encampment, due to its presence and impact, does not pass this test.

The evidence that the University lawyers presented regarding the statements, signs, videos, and social media posts of the Occupy UofT accounts, were pretty damning and the Respondents (aka defence) only responded with “this is not us” and that “these are outside agitators.” The Respondents will get to make much of their case tomorrow.

Another huge blow to the Respondents was the deposition with Yassin, an organizer, that said effectively (paraphrasing) “we don’t know how many people are here, or who they are, and because of that, there’s no way of us being able to getting a consensus on the results of negotiations with the university simply because we don’t know who our parties are.” Yassin also stated that he/she/they didn’t know many of the people engaged in the negotiations with the university.

It’s literally in their charter to kill Jews, and the only reason they haven’t done it is because they don’t have the means. 

Meanwhile, Israel could have wiped out Palestinians out several times over. Instead, it treats Gazans in its hospitals, most famously operating on Sinwar, who went and organized Oct 7th.

i mean...isn't albanese the special rapporteur that the un has appointed to investigate the situation? she is the one being delegated by the un to investigate and form conclusions, and in that sense, what she's saying isn't independent of what the un is saying. and the report ""Anatomy of a Genocide"" is considered a draft report authored by the un hrc, i think.

of countries whose un representatives and political leaders have spoken about the issue, many of them have explicitly called what israel has been doing ""genocide"". these include: south africa, brazil, iran, syria, malaysia, russia. there are also many countries that label what israel is doing as things like ""collective punishment"" or ""decimation of civilian populations"" (i mean: how do you call something a genocide without saying genocide, if one takes issue with the term being underdefined). (and in the background of all of this: i assume there is american pressure being applied internationally for countries to speak softly where israel is concerned, so in some ways it's remarkable that international political leaders are being so direct, but i'm not citing sources here and don't want to go more into it.)

the topic of whether something can be labeled as genocide (and who has the authority to apply that label and make it stick) is super thorny. i think all i'm saying is: it's reasonable to think that around the world, a majority of countries and people think that what israel is doing is genocide. given that: uoft should be expected to engage in transparent conversations about whether its money is going towards assisting probable genocide, and to strategize--and implement strategies--for avoiding doing so. that's at the root of what the protestors are asking. gertler is getting caught up in trivial questions like ""are the protestors behaving civilly enough"" ""can the university punish students for being cliquey"" and side-stepping much larger questions re: what are the university's responsibilities--and how does the university act according to its principles--in situations where the institution is possibly complicit in (what can be reasonably agreed to be) mass atrocities.",comment,1

Except it is. That is literally one of the key roles a university plays in society.

Yes, and I agree it's not a black and white issue. The admin and students will need to meet in the middle to end the conflict peacefully.

>a small number of protestors

Even though not everyone is participating in the encampment, there are thousands of people who have been vocal supporters, including just about all the faculty, staff, and student unions. 

>“but children are dying!”

Is it a radical position to be against the slaughter and starvation of children? Not just Gaza, but Sudan,  If that doesn't motive you for change, it seem heartless and lacking in compassion.

>it’s not our university’s job to take a position on every global matter

Students formed anti-apartheid groups on campuses in the mid-80's. Universities are the right places for social activism to take place. What's happening now is repeat of the activism back then.

chinese spokespeople on the issue are calling it collective punishment targeting specific ethnoracial population, which in so far as i understand would be a genocidal act.

it looks like recent un hrc report does use the term genocide when describing israel's actions: [here](https://www.ohchr.org/en/news/2024/06/commission-inquiry-occupied-palestinian-territory-concludes-israeli-authorities-and#:~:text=with%20international%20law.-,In%20relation%20to%20Israel's%20military%20operations%20and%20attacks%20in%20Gaza,extermination%2C%20intentionally%20directing%20attacks%20against)

one of my points was not that it is not in consensus that what israel has been is genocide: i think spokespeople from a lot of countries are describing genocide without using the specific term. the world agrees that something very bad is happening, which is why i think uoft needs to seriously consider its complicity and also act. i think we're seeing international consensus and it's reasonable to think so; i don't necessarily think any small group of protestors should be able to be like ""x group is doing bad thing"" when that contravenes how a majority of observers view the situation and in that situation compel the university to address/change its policies and behaviours.",comment,1

i have never said that i agree with or endorse all un decisions (i certainly do not). all i've said in this specific discussion is that: recent un (and affiliated) reports on israel's activities provide one indication that there exists international consensus that israel has been committing mass atrocities (and i think many do label these atrocities as genocide). it seems really weird to think that just because i think un organs have recently been at least somewhat accurately reporting on and assessing israel's activities, that i think that the un has never made a bad decision. (the un is a super complicated institution with a super complicated history, much like many things that exist internationally--was my agreement with recent un reports predicated on my not understanding that the un has certainly recognized statehood for states that came into being through occupation? no...?)

furthermore: i never said that i'm personally against for e.g. some kind of two state solution. i never said that i deny israel's current right to exist as a state. 

i just think that we should be clear about how israel came into being as a place/state (including: the various actors involved and what kind of powers they had to make what happened happen), if we're going to try to accurate assess and pass any useful judgement on what various actors have done/are doing/what any of it means/past and future outcomes. if someone came and took your home by force and you say you're going to kill them, i guess you could label that as genocidal intent. to do that seems to miss what the situation actually is.

finally: i don't know what you mean by consistency. if by consistency you mean consistently thinking the palestinians are and have always been the bad guys, or the jews are and have always been the bad guys, then no i don't subscribe to being consistently simple-minded. based on what i've posted on reddit, you don't have even the start of any evidence about what i'm consistent or inconsistent about. i don't even know who you think my ""ilk"" are.",comment,0

Sentiment around the Israel-Palestine conflict has been shifting for a while because a minority raised awareness on what the IDF is doing. If you stop activism because you are scared of a majority that may or may not exist, then you are a fool.


Look, if you don’t want to oppose the atrocities being committed by the IDF because the Israel-Palestine issue is a “complex issue,” go for it.

you have to know that at least a good 30% of people who are leading pro palestine protests in toronto are jewish. yes, there is a generation of jewish people (or like a couple of generations, idk)--and a lot of them are people who've personally emigrated from europe--who are very attached to the idea of a jewish ethnostate homeland. but on the other hand: a lot of jewish people, especially young people, who were born in for e.g. north america, don't feel that excluded from the society that they grew up in and have relatively little attachment to the idea or need for a jewish homeland. 

the need for israel to exist isn't inextricable from the jewish identity: i would say that probably half of jewish people in north america aren't actually that attached to needing israel to exist as a jewish ethnostate. there is a good proportion of jewish people who embrace their jewish identity and culture while being adamantly against the existence of israel (or the existence of israel as it's existed). it's really possible to be anti-zionist without being anti-semitic. do i think that protestors in toronto are being unproductively mean and antagonistic towards zionists? i do actually, but it doesn't mean that they're being anti-semitic.
