Ive slaved away this entire semester going for really good grades. Mat244, I understand all the material very well; come a GROUP exam which is worth 20% of the grade. I simulate an ODE in Excel. It doesnt look right. I simulate it over and over again and nothing changes. We take a completely wrong, really treacharous approach to solving the problem. 10 minutes left. I reenter the model. Get a clearly proper result. But its too late, and despite my best efforts to finish some problems, we end up getting 10% on the midterm. I screwed up a symbol in Excel and now my entire life is ruined.

Im seriously considering killing myself over this. I dont know how Im supposed to go on, this school has beat me down completely. Its won, congratulations. I dont know what to do. My entire GPA is gonna be spoiled because of this. Its over. No coordinators involved are remotely open to curving. I dont know what to do. Theres no way I can drop the course. Its too late. LWD deadline passed. Its just over. I had my chance and its gone. Its done. What do I even do??? How do I even keep going? This has spoiled my grade, my average, probably the $1000 scholarship, Im just beat and want it all to be over. ",submission,25

if it helps, youre not unjustified in your feelings over the difficulty of the group final. i took it too and found it completely unfair. there's a full on revolt taking place on piazza right now over the final and how it was graded. good place to vent your frustrations if you're into that.

there's still an individual final coming up. 20% of the grade is left to be earned. don't give up now, still hope to be had and work to be done.",comment,11

Worst course ever in my university life and really regret about not dropping it. Still need 50% on final so I could JUST PASS it. GPA killer, Im literally passing away.",comment,3

I’m even somehow doing reasonably well in the course and even so i’m so fucking done w this course, can’t even imagine how it feels for everyone whose GPA is getting fucked.

It’s literally just ODEs it’s not that hard to teach ffs, some kinda profs are always trying to reinvent the wheel",comment,1

Unfortunately, none of the reception on Piazza seems to be taken seriously by the course coordinators, feels very hopeless.

The group final was definitely unfair but it's frustrating that I could've done so much better and got screwed up by a negative sign in Excel :( I really don't find Excel simulations appropriate for the exam setting in a math course. It's too finicky and doesn't test the right things imo.

It's been so difficult to focus on the individual final... it just feels meaningless considering I'll literally be fighting tooth and nail for a 2.7. You're right though, must be done",comment,1
