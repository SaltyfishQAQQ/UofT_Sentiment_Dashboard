The prof also preferred to just get it over with.

  
I posted this video primarilly because people in another post complain about how ""freedom of speech is violated"" because someone got called into the dean's office for [supporting Palestine on Internet](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1guoyw8/u_of_t_faculty_members_called_into_deans_office/). The Varsity also argues that the pro-Israel protest represents U of T ""[fails to keep its students safe](https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1guozt7/op_ed_once_again_u_of_t_fails_to_keep_its/)"" because it involves former leader of a terrorist organization. I pointed out what the Palestine supporters on campus have done is reasonable for the school to be nervous, and at least the pro-Israel protests did not breach into lectures.

  
And of course I got downvoted to hell. Can't believe it is acceptable for many U of T people to have lectures interrupted like this.",comment,8
