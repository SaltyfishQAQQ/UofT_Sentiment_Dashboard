Maybe it would’ve been easier at UW, but I still found enjoyable internships every summer as a UofT student and I was able to break into my preferred industry. People like to exaggerate the difference between UW & UofT coop to the point of “if you choose the wrong one, it’ll ruin your entire career” but that’s far from the case. Again, I do think UW’s coop is better operated & connected, but ultimately UofT is still a top 20 engineering school worldwide and its coop program will also set you up for success. Remember that university coop is just the first step of your very long career, and in hindsight this decision won’t matter nearly as much as you think, especially when it’s between two options that are both great already.

On another note, I also love UofT’s campus and Toronto as a city. Living downtown is an experience in itself that can’t quite be replicated, and socially speaking, engineering here is a very tight knit faculty and you’ll get to meet many great people to enjoy college life with.",comment,12

I didn't get into UW but still ended up right where I wanted to be in my career by focusing on the important things (networking, projects, etc). Especially for someone like you in mechanical engineering, the 12-16 months offered by PEY might be better for certain industries rather than the 4-month cycles at UW. 

On top of that, as you said the community at UofT is generally better but you definitely do need to make an effort to develop a good friend circle.",comment,2

You're comparing two similar programs. Maybe things would be different if you went to Queen's/McMaster/Western but U of T and Waterloo are similar in terms of culture, difficulty, etc. The job outcomes are similar between both schools. The biggest difference between these options is that one is in Toronto and the other is in Waterloo. 

Your first job after graduating will be the hardest to get, and doubly so if you have no co-op experience. Waterloo will force you to get pre-graduation experience, whereas at U of T you'll have to do this for yourself. If you go to U of T, I highly recommend you get summer job experience regardless of whether you do PEY, because a) you'll have more experience and b) you'll get to see different companies/industries/workplace cultures. 

If there's anything I regret, it's not having gone to an ""easier"" school in order to be able to get higher marks to get into a better graduate school. But it's engineering so it's going to be difficult anywhere. 

Here's my recommendation: if there is something in your gut that tells you that you would prefer to go to U of T, then go to U of T. If it's (as you say) the campus, the greenery, the architecture - just pick U of T. Waterloo has a better co-op program, but don't logic yourself into picking something you don't really want when you're already choosing from two great options.",comment,2

I commuted from home and as a result didn’t make a whole lot of friends.

As for internships I got a 16-month PEY after 3rd year which turned into a well paying full time job which I will be starting tomorrow. Yes I gained some seniority during my PEY which let me start a bit above jr. I’m always gonna be grateful to the PEY system for getting me that job (I did have to send out like 200 applications tho lol). However my friends at UW got to try a bunch of different internships which I’d liked to have done. Especially ones in the states. 

Another thing is the difficulty of UofT. I know in theory all engineering schools are the same but obviously that won’t be the case. My friends at UW def had it easier even by a bit. I had way too many late nights wondering if I’m gonna pass a class. Also, idk if this is a UofT thing, but if u fail an engineering class in anything after 1st year, you can’t take it in the summer or anything to quickly make up for it (with some exceptions like APS360). So you have to postpone other classes as a result.

There are a lot of good things about UofT ofc. The engineering student body is kinda small so we have our own little section within campus. The uni being downtown is another perk (unless you grew up in Toronto like me and already knew/explored all the spots before even coming to UofT lol).

The UofT name also goes very far. I got my internship at a place where I’d say 85-90% of the engineers were former UofT students. I’ve been told by some recruiters during PEY interviews that they exclusively hire from UofT and UW, and in general ppl think you’re way smarter than you actually are lol.",comment,2

Both are regarded as top school so congrats on your offer to both. Personally, I really like how our curriculum is scheduled because this year, I was able to work with an actual client for a course called Eng strategies and practice and was able to implement a software report on the technical aspects of the machine learning software we built to help students with dyslexia read. I don't think waterloo has this course, so it's def a leg up in terms of the experiences you have as a first year, which is helpful for applying to jobs. I'm also interested in undergrad research, and we have a lot of opportunities in research and millions of dollars being pumped into the university, and my profs were always doing really interesting things which seemed cool. Our design teams are also really neat, our aerospace team recently launched a CUBE satellite on a SpaceX rocket, and a lot of our formula racing team heads to tesla every year and they recently won first in their competition against other schools, beating MIT (I will brag about this to anyone who listens). I think if you are worried about FAANG hiring you, be assured they do so at both universities but waterloo just does more frequently is the only difference. Eng is also a separate faculty away from the Arts and Sciences, so you don't face any requirements like POSt or anything like that. Def over this first year, some of my memorable experiences have been learning how to manage my time well and FROSH! frosh is so fun! But yeah, we have a little culture within uoft (called skule) and everyone is in it together, which is another thing I like, cause the environment isn't as cutthroat as I imagine waterloo to be when you're competing with your peers for co-ops constantly. And I think if you like the look of the campus, that's always a plus, because you'll always be in awe. Feel free to dm with any questions, and good luck :). also, feel free to check out some of our design teams on their ig if you'd like to learn more.",comment,1

That’s all you need to know. The co-op program is one thing. The students at Waterloo are just outright superior mentally compared to UofT. It’s not that UW is toxic, it’s honestly much more so that students here are just not as strong-willed compared to UW.

Also Waterloo’s first and second year Mechanical curriculum is both easier and better than UofT.

Social life is similar to Waterloo, it’s the same. Waterloo has much lower course workload.

I say this many times, but it’s rly the cream of the crop, the people you will be around is what makes the biggest difference.

Also if you care about getting tech or robotics co-ops as a Mech student, Waterloo is superior, if you’re more set on traditional Mech, PEY is roughly on the same page.

Like curriculum wise, outside of first year, I honestly think UofT bests UW (ME100 and ME101 are amazing practical design and communication courses), Waterloo Mech especially going into third year I find gets a lot weaker. That being said tho, finding a job is very hard, and often people overestimate their own will and initiative. I know someone else touched on initiative and job finding culture, but this is something you genuinely need someone or something to force down your throat especially in a trash market like present day, otherwise the results you want aren’t going to happen.",comment,1

If you became a UW student and visited U of T, I think based on your comment you would think, ""wow it would be nice to be a student here."" But if you went to U of T and visited Waterloo would you feel the same way? I'm not so sure.

The outcomes from both programs are going to be similar. They're top Canadian engineering schools. Whether you get decent jobs is going to depend on other factors. If you go to U of T, just make sure to hustle to get summer jobs so that you have some experience before PEY.

Lastly - you're pursuing engineering so you probably want to rationalize this decision and reassure your brain that you're doing the right thing.

Some of the people who got top grades that didn't go to ib or ap taught me that it's definitely possible, but it's also up to you to put away the phone away (my mom was right, it's the damn phone) and look for alternate study strategies where needed. I think this is general advice that would apply anywhere tho in terms of gpa struggles - you really need to take the initiative to figure out what style of learning works for you in a course based on  if the prof's teaching style aligns with how you learn, and proactively seeking supplementary ways, whether that's going to another lecture section or using the textbook. I personally grinded through ece110 in like 3 days for exams by looking at the textbook cause my prof was really bad, and wished I'd done it earlier. Also, something I would note is consider if both schools give you the chance to move out or not. Me personally, I had some money saved up for if I was going to move out, but coming to UofT allowed me to be more productive with the money versus spending it all on res. Although I do miss not being able to have a typical uni res life, so if you think that's a major factor that would affect your happiness - do consider it. In terms of co-op and employability, I know that the job market isn't that hot rn, so I know my waterloo peeps have also been struggling. I also know from a friend that her first 2 co-ops came from her dad's company, which is very similar to what my friends are doing, it's only in third and fourth year where you get the big names, so I'm not quite sure what that looks like. But also (sorry for rambling), I've heard from my uw friends that what really makes waterloo known for it's co-op is the culture of everyone looking for jobs at the same time - it gives the average lazy student the incentive to hustle.

I can tell you that only 5% at most of first years have gotten something this year.

Like that’s my main point, the difference between being forced to do something and being able to go do it out of pure initiative is quite big, and I’m sure there are a lot of people like you who think that way at first and just give up halfway. Again, not being forced, can often yield very different results.

And frankly UofT has more fucked courses for you to deal with. You’ll have a lot more free time at Waterloo. I’m not trying to say going here will make you incapable of finding something, but the reality of the situation is a lot more grim than you think it is, and UofT simply does not help your cause when it comes to this.

My point isn’t actually about the co-op program, it’s more so that you’re drastically underestimating how much your surroundings can fundamentally influence your character. It matters more than you think.",comment,2

Some of them you’ll be a fully established member, some you’ll have more responsibility, and some you might have less responsibility.

Waterloo knows some students will end up stuck in a photocopier room for 4 months and be more or less useless. The 4 month terms stops that from ending up being a full year of being useless. You get exposed to completely different managers willing to give more or less responsibility. And if something does click - you can return in the next co-op.",comment,3

You won’t land a good job simply because you’re from UW or UofT, but you will with a strong resume, polished interview skills, and high academic standings. Most of the big companies hire from both schools so it’s not exactly a school exclusive thing.

Also personally, I would absolutely hate the on-off thing with Waterloo coop as someone who had to relocate for internships because moving around that much is genuinely a hassle. Minor detail but still something to consider.",comment,7
