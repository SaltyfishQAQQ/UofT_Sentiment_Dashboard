Problem is she copy pasted the criticism and grade even when they don’t match. I emailed her but she isn’t responding and the Prof said TAs are in charge of grading. I don’t know who else to contact, there’s no exam so I’m really lost here.",submission,16

As for copy-pasting comments, this is super common, once you grade a few assignments you build a repository of the most common comments and paste them as needed. Don't be surprised if you have the exact same comments as some of your classmates.",comment,28

You have the right to ask for an appeal, so they need to respect the process and your TA needs to communicate to you whether you need to appeal to the prof directly. I mean, they need to give an answer.",comment,10

The thing is that I sent a clarification email first which I’m guessing she ignored and the professor advised me to wait which is why I didn’t email her again. Everything was stacked against me, I couldn’t contact or meet her so I was going through this blind. It’s so unfair.",comment,1

While you might’ve received a better mark on that component, your arguments might’ve not been as strong. Or your TA might have evaluated the quality of your sources this time around rather than the number.",comment,1

I think there might be some sort of miscommunication here. The appeal process must be on the syllabus. Did you follow the process? If not, can you follow the process now and ask for the appeal based on what is written on the syllabus?",comment,2

Maybe you can request to meet with the prof on zoom and talk with them directly and explain the situation. They will tell you how to proceed and it’s unlikely they will deny a request to meet, especially if it’s for clarification purposes.",comment,2
