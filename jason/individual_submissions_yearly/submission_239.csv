I decided to get an iud and I‚Äôm now emotional. This is good for 5 years and the fact that this little device that looks like a robotic sprout will accompany my body for the next half a decade makes me feel i‚Äôm not alone in life? Whatever happens this sprout will stay inside of me throughout the years, my highs and lows, and anywhere in between. Instead of carrying a fetus baby, it feels like I‚Äôm carrying this little guardian angel that protects me from the external force. It encourages me to live my best for the next five years because i have company that i can trust. I‚Äôm literally so delusional rn, I might even get sad when i have to take it out‚Ä¶ is it normal to develop an emotional connection w a medical implant..?

Anyways, i almost went to the health and wellness centre at uoft but the doctor there told me the procedure will be EXTREMELY painful, so i went to a different clinic and the insertion was very well done. I personally think the pain level depends on individual pain tolerance and the practitioner‚Äôs skills in delicacy. So I highly recommend doing consultations to find the right doctor who is skilled and experienced in the process.",submission,114

I think in general doctors will warn you that the procedure can be extremely painful; I think it's just as a caution to prepare you as I suspect it's dependent on the person. I did mine in Markham, and the doctor had a nurse on the side to hold my hand during the session. I also didn't have a bad experience. 

Also, from what I remember: if you're below 25 and an Ontario resident you can get a hormonal IUD for free!! (In case you already used all of the contraceptive money or you just graduated.)",comment,1
