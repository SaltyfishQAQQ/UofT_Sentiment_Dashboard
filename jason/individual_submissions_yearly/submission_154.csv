Reflections from a Finished 1 Year Transferring to a US University,ryyanoh,1cpfvz0,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cpfvz0/reflections_from_a_finished_1_year_transferring/,1715428769.0,"I just finished my 1st year at UofT as an international student from US (Cali) and am considering several US university's to transfer for my 2nd year. Everyone's experience will be different so take everything I say with a grain of salt. I tried to make this as applicable to UofT as possible and not general University advice.

1. Definitely try to live on residence 1st year. Not only will you be closer to your classes and exams which will encourage you to attend lectures and tutorials, but a lot of your social life will revolve around your dormmates/floor and people you meet at your residence. It's also cheaper compared to nearby apartments or condo's and try to avoid Campus One and Chestnut due to lack of proximity to campus and cost.

2. Do not buy the most expensive meal plan, buy the cheapest one (unless you eat a lot). 90% of my friends on meal plans did not use up all their swipes by the end of their year and had hundreds of dollars worth of swipes left over. The food from New College and Morrison is pretty good and food quality definitely varies across colleges. 

3. The social scene is not great especially compared to US schools as a lot of students commute and Greek Life isn't that popular here (less frats and sororities esp compared to undergrad pop). However, it's not as bad as people make it out to be and a lot of people who complain are not making much of an effort to put themselves out there. 

4. A lot of the students here aren't really trying to socialize and are more focused on their academics which is understandable due to the grade deflation. It's important to find your group of people which can be difficult but at the same time the undergrad population is huge.

5. A good amount of people should not be here. For a lot of them it's not even their fault, they have to commute 2 hours everyday, work 2 jobs outside of school, have family issues ongoing, or just cannot mentally handle the workload and difficulty of the Uni. However, the rest just don't really care and when you stop caring, your grades can drop in an instant. It just takes on midterm so try to keep a mindset where you overshoot expectations for midterms so you have room to mess up on the final.

6. Everyone has different experiences with Prof's but personally, the ones I had were some of the best instructors I have ever had. The Prof's at the this uni are some of the best around the world, but some Prof's are clearly at their position due to the research ability and not their teaching. McIvor for Soc is a good first year elective for those unsure of what to take and if you can memorize well.

7. The Uni is competitive but not in the kind of vibe that students are competing against each other. There are curves for most courses but people are still willing to cooperate and work together. There is a feeling of a shared struggle rather than a ""I can't help anyone else bc they could beat me out"" mentality. The people you know in your classes can definitely affect your grade positively in a major way.

8. Especially in Soc Sci and Humanities courses, grading is very arbitrary and often times you won't get feedback for your essays or assignments. Regrade opportunities are present but I refuse to believe that a difference in TA would not affect your grade in a major way the first time around. If you are aiming for an A, sticking to the rubic won't be enough, try to go above and beyond.

9. The school does not see you as a person but rather a data point. I don't blame the Prof's or admin for this but the structure of the school. People talk about weed-out courses but the weed-out system applies to the university as a whole. It is not in the Uni's best interest that you do well but that their average grades hit a certain mark (usually around a B-) to keep the school's prestige. 

10. Around 1/3 of the school is international from either China, India, South Korea, or Japan. They usually form their own groups and don't interact much with other students outside of their international community even if they don't have a strong language barrier. Off topic but I've noticed that a lot of the relationships I saw on campus were Chinese int. couples if not the majority at times (maybe bc of the social pressure back home to find a partner idk)

11. Take easy electives. Don't be that one guy who takes CSC110, MAT137, and then 3 more difficult STEM electives. This doesn't apply too much if you're in Rotman but your electives should be Soc Sci unless you're really cracked as STEM topics. STEM students tend to try harder so even if a STEM course and a Soc Sci course has a similar average, the Soc Sci course will be easier assuming that you don't lean a particular direction.

12. The grade deflation is tough. For 1st years the average GPA is a 2.7 and the highest avg out of all my courses was a B- (2.7). However, if you give your 100% I don't see a reason why you should not get a 3.0+ unless you have a special circumstance (work, illness, age, etc.) One of the major reasons I'm transferring away.

13. The city is really nice, there's alot to do downtown and you should definitely take advantage of being in the center of DT Toronto. The food here is better then almost anywhere I've been since there are a lot of Mom and Pop places and less chains especially compared to the US. The Pink Chinese Truck is one of my favorites especially their Chicken Sandwich and if you live on Woodsworth, Majestic Shawarma is a nice place for a quick lunch (hi bossman if ur reading this). 

14. Most people sleep after 3AM and wake up after 12PM on the weekends. I would say to sleep early but that only works if you work well in the mornings which doesn't apply to most people. NEVER take morning classes. It doesn't matter if it's a program req there's always going to be a class that isn't before 11AM. Take the 8PM class if you have to. A late class is better than not going to class.

15. Your happiest moments will be the smallest ones. This never applied to me until I came here. I don't know what to make of it but it is what is it. 

Good luck to all incoming first years and I hope the structure of the University improves over the years. I'll definitely miss my time here :)",submission,169
