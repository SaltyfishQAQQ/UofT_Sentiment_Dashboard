It is interesting how some people are suddenly so interested in stepping on the grass that they had previously ignored, right up until there were protestors on it who they could harass and aggravate. But that is probably just a coincidence.

They are letting almost everyone in.

1. Ottowa actually has the power to apply pressure on the israeli government, university divestments will do nothing.
2. The university has made their position clear, if you want divestments you have to go through the official channels designed for this process, they were even willing to speed the process up. No amount of ""protesting"" is going to change that position.
3. This is the biggest issue, political academic boycotts are against the fundamental principles of research. When science involves politics its no longer science, its politics.
