Friend Got Assaulted Outside of Madison Avenue Pub,ArmyOfDarkness89,1h0nz1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h0nz1h/friend_got_assaulted_outside_of_madison_avenue_pub/,1732658084.0,"My friend got sucker punched waiting for his Uber at 2:30AM on Saturday outside of Madison Pub near Bloor and Spadina. He ended up having multiple surgeries over the weekend to repair several broken bones in his face. From what I've heard the assault was quite long and may have been caught on video as the area was quite busy. Looking for anyone who has a video or could point me to a place where videos like this might be posted. Any help is much appreciated!

Edit: thanks for all the advice everyone, no major updates at this time, if anyone can provide any information leading to the arrest of this individual that a financial reward would still be available",submission,161

Go to where the assault happened and ask businesses nearby if they have security cameras that might have caught the incident. Don't delay because they might only keep recordings for a few days. You can also try asking the police if there are any government owned cameras that might have caught the incident.,comment,42
