My MPH program involves a lot of participation, discussions, and presentations but my undergrad did as well… so not much different! The stats classes are much more in depth but the smaller class sizes makes it easy to access/discuss with my professors. 

Research opportunities might be better if you do an MSc in Epi though, my MPH is course-based so not much of a research focus.",comment,4

I also did research through a work study position during my MPH, and most of my classmates were working during the school year. The courses I found to be easier than undergrad for sure.",comment,2
