I google everyone's name before I hire them. If I see that they have been pieces of shit in the past, I don't take a risk for my company. It's too much liability. 

Just like Noah is able to communicate with others, others are allowed to stop communicating with Noah..

This is not a case of Noah's life being ruined, this is a case of Noah needing to be a better person. Actions have consequences. Someone who is shitty to others does not deserve anything from others. 

YOU mentioning the pendulum swinging to the right is misleading and propaganda. Policies and legislation introduced by right wing politics further enables businesses and lawmakers to discriminate. If Noah continues to be shitty, he will inevitably be unhoused or low income, regardless of the political powers that be. 

The difference is that under right wing politics, Noah will also lose any support systems to help him improve and get his life on track to break out of the cyclical behavioural mess that he is. 

Right wing politics and educational funding + social support are two things that don't belong in the same sentence.

Your right wing politics comment is the one I am talking about with regards to disinformation. 

There is no reddit echo chamber -  just me and you - and I'm calling out your bullshit comment.

You quoted that Noah's life being ruined by social media is causing others to swing to the right. 

I agree that his social media comments have a lot of potential to ruin his life.

I don't agree nor disagree with your assessment of what OP is doing by also provoking Noah. 

I disagree with everything else you are saying and telling you that you don't get to fabricate lies and throw them around on the internet.

You dont get to get upset at the person who calls you out on it. 

You don't get to scapegoat your inability to research before making a contradictory statement on the 'reddit hivemind' mentality. 

Politic beliefs have little bearing over social media accountability and to be frank, I don't really even care what your political beliefs are. 

I DO care about how you are using  political beliefs to approach this situation. Your right wing politics comment is an attempt to weaponize and sow discontent among others who might not be educated in these areas. Your right wing politics comment is also inaccurate. 

You do not understand your political platforms if you believe that right wing politics would make this scenario better for Noah in any way. 


So please..

Don't spread disinformation. 

Don't deflect and be defensive when others call you out.

Not all guns are loaded, but what's the first lesson of gun safety? Treat all guns like they're loaded. Well, that's the first rule of women's safety, too. We don't know who's gunna rape and/or kill us, so we have to be wary and skeptical until it's proven you're not one of the ones that will hurt us. And even then, some men lie. A lot of abusive relationships start with flowers, love, affection, romance etc, they lie till you're stuck. That's when the abuse starts, when you can't leave. 

And BTW, I, and all the women I know, learned men are dangerous from the men in our lives, dad's, uncles, brothers, cousins, not women, men. Men told us men are bad, men raised us to be scared of men, men set this society up in a way that harms men and women, and the men in power will only listen to other men. So we need the ""good men"" to work with us, not get offended when we're talking about issues in society. Similarly to white women who are shocked to learn, black women don't trust us, our experiences tell us to be wary of you, and you need to stop taking that personally because it's not about you boo. It's about society. 

We're out here being abused, killed, raped, and having our bodily autonomy taken away. Please stop making this about yourself. Making it about yourself because your feelings got hurt because you assumed someone was talking about you when they weren't (if you're actually the good man you think you are) is a great way to make women feel unsafe.",comment,2

""The Immaculate Conception is the belief that the Virgin Mary was free of original sin from the moment of her conception.""

So she was slated to give birth to Jesus before even SHE was born.

This is when she is told what will happen to her:

26In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth, 27to a virgin betrothed to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. And the virgin ‚Äòs name was Mary. 28And he came to her and said, ‚ÄúGreetings, O favored one, the Lord is with you!‚Äù 29But she was greatly troubled at the saying, and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be. 30And the angel said to her, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. 31And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus. 32He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. And the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, 33and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.‚Äù
34And Mary said to the angel, ‚ÄúHow will this be, since I am a virgin?‚Äù
35And the angel answered her, ‚ÄúThe Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you; therefore the child to be born will be called holy ‚Äî the Son of God. 36And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month with her who was called barren. 37For nothing will be impossible with God.‚Äù 38And Mary said, ‚ÄúBehold, I am the servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your word.‚Äù And the angel departed from her.

So she wasn't asked, she was told. She consented after being informed of her fate but like.... Do you want a ticket straight to eternal suffering for fucking up this plan GOD has been cooking up for you your entire life?",comment,2

My father is a retired lawyer, my prof is a former police officer, and I am affiliated and work with the RCMP, and I want to become a lawyer. This entire interaction would barely count as criminal harassment and any judge that would come across this case if it even had enough grounds to be put into court at all, would throw it out immediately. People kill themselves over who gets voted in during American and Canadian elections all the time, there‚Äôs a specific dataset and statistic for it, and every time you vote, you have the ability to encourage people to end it, is voting for a candidate truly not that impactful to some people? Did you even think of that every time you have ever voted? it can harm so many lives, if you haven‚Äôt thought of that, that‚Äôs asinine. 
You‚Äôve used the flawed argument at the very least 4 times, and have skipped almost anything everyone has ever replied with, with the same copied and pasted word-jumble and shitty ‚Äòwhat-if‚Äô scenarios. 
This wouldn‚Äôt even fully meet the criteria to fit for *criminal* harassment whatsoever, and this would never even see court. This is further proved by Criminal Code (R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46), 264(1); and (2)-b. 

I would like to further add that she did not contact him initially, and while any reaction is of one‚Äôs own accord, because he started the interaction, he is at the very least, partially liable for much of what one may do to remove themselves or defend themselves, especially when the only reason they would have every done anything, can be attributed to solely, him contacting them; and on at least the one occasion that we know he did. Furthermore, with multiple other women who have come forward and shared credible stories of him contacting and harassing them, there is a consistent pattern of behaviour that the ‚Äòdefendant‚Äô in this case would have; which builds a very strong relationship between him having access to communication with multiple women, (let alone men, boys, and girls) and harassing people, pretty consistently.",comment,3
