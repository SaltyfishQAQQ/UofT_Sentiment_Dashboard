U of T students have access to a free 1Password family account,frannies_goldsmith,1ewwxtk,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ewwxtk/u_of_t_students_have_access_to_a_free_1password/,1724163914.0,"FYI, this rolled out this summer. U of T students now have access to a free 1Password family account for six years. I have been using 1Password for years and it's great. With a family account you can add an extra four people onto your plan with their own accounts, share vaults, etc.

I wonder how long this promotion will be available; I took a look at the link it redirects to (https://uthrprod.service-now.com/sp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0015368), and it sounds like the 6 years of access starts when I redeem the coupon code; I wonder if I redeem it right before I graduate (in like 2 years) if that'll still be the case.

I'm satisfied with Bitwarden's free plan right now (and am entrenched enough that I don't want to bother with the transition), but I'll happily redeem $60x6=$360 (the family plan costs $60 annually) worth of 1Password membership for free even if I don't need it :D",comment,2

Looks like there is a code you need to enter with your u of t email, then you can claim your free family account with your personal email. I am guessing you can use your existing 1Password account when actually setting up the account - that is how it worked for me -- and I ended up with a credit with 1Password for what I paid for part of the year.",comment,3
