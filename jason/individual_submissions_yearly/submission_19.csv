These cheaters are fucking crazy (translation of pic is at the end of this post),Longjumping_Meet6412,1fqfcnj,https://i.redd.it/c1u5cnjb1ard1.jpeg,1727410172.0,"So here’s some background information: I am a first year student, taking mat137. On the first day there were people standing outside of the classroom asking us to join a WeChat group chat that’s consisted of students. I was like ok that sounds good maybe I can ask general questions there so I joined. The next morning I woke up and found several people adding me and told me they’re my classmates and would like to make friends with me, again I think it’s fine even though I don’t socialize so I just said yes and left them there in my contact list. 

We never talked, and then recently, to be more specific this week, at different times, they all sent me the exact same message asking me if I need help in homework/quiz/exam. At first I just blocked them all but tonight after receiving this message for the fifth time I got annoyed and asked them what it is. They told me that they can do hw/quiz/exam for me as long as I pay them, and I can even customize the grade. I asked them why aren’t they afraid of getting caught and they told me that there are colluded teacher in uoft and that they have professional team to deal with these problems. That’s insane, I don’t know if that’s true but the fact that they said it and send those messages to a random person like me is crazy. 

I literally just got back home from school after spending 13 hours at school continuously studying my ass off and this happened. These cheaters make me mad asf

Here’s the translation of the message: 

- hii babe need help with homework/quiz/exam?The recent price is very nice! You can also guarantee high score to! Let yourself be the best one! Free consultation. Feel free to contact me at any time to arrange.

What’s this? Pay you to do exam?

- yep you can think so

Didn’t you say you’re a student?

- I am, but I’m also doing international study service

Aren’t you afraid of getting caught and being kicked out?

- Nope they won’t find out. I won’t be doing this if they could. 

Why? Nobody reported you?

- Because we have a professional team here. Plus, as long as you’re not telling this to others no one will know. 

So you’re saying even if you get reported, you can still get rid of that?

- That will count as a complaint. It surely can be dealt. After all, there are professional staff doing this as well.

You mean staff inside U of T?

- Our professional team contact teachers in the school to resolve complaints. Which means directly to the teachers at this school.

So you’re saying that there are teachers colluded?

- you can understand so

From which department? The one that specifically deal with ao?

- Yep

I kinda do assignments for students and I have done this for the past 5 years both as a student and after I have completed. The main reason I do it is mainly to help students that have to work 2/3 jobs to raise school fees and money for survival, leaving little time for actual assignments or classwork. I felt guilty at the beginning but we all gotta survive, right? Anyway, also I work on the principle of willing buyer, willing seller. I however make sure I deliver quality and sometimes work with experts for technical tasks and that pays my bills. I don’t see any issue with that as long as it is a case of willing buyer, willing seller. Anyway, thats my opinion. Cheers guys!",comment,-4

(1) It's a lot of work reporting cheats, since the allegations must be investigated through due process  by the administration, and the burden of proof then falls upon the professor (who must write reports, attend meetings). (2) Often it is corrupt TAs from China who do the cheating, e.g. when they grade the exam papers or assignments.

For this, and other reasons, TAs are the Achilles' Heel of the North American university system.",comment,7

If the course is using crowdmark, there is no way of seeing students name or id. 2. No way TAs can arbitrarily change the grade of students, every change on quercus leaves a record. 3. Over 90% of the TAs are grad students, the stakes for helping students cheat is way too high 4. It is true that reporting cheats is a lot of work, but cheaters are punished through giving them 0s on exams or assignments, so you can't say nothing is done towards cheaters. 

I know cheaters would always find a way to cheat, but collusion within TAs and profs are too much of a stretch. It is postpandemic era where a lot of anticheat softwares were made. Have a bit of faith on the university system.

Ps: The contact in the post is more of a scammer than a powetful, underground, corrupt, Chinese centered organization. If anything, those scammers target fresh, wide-eyed Chinese international students",comment,7

首先，我没有小红书。
