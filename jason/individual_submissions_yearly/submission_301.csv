What on earth is going on in PSY280? Ranttttttttt,whatatimetobealiver,1d5yptn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d5yptn/what_on_earth_is_going_on_in_psy280_ranttttttttt/,1717281181.0,"For anyone also taking PSY280 right now, please tell me I'm not alone? I took this class because the prof had amazing rate my prof reviews and it is online asynchronous, but I'm honestly having such a horrible time and getting my butt kicked so unnecessarily? 

First of all, Packback is the bane of my existence. Tell me why we had to pay 40 bucks for AI to (poorly) grade our discussion posts? I keep getting the ""be careful with hedge words"" feedback, but like bro, if I am talking about studies, theories, or my own opinion well I **AM** going to use words such as ""may, might, can"" and it's sooo unnecessary that the AI docks points for ""convention"" because of hedge words. It forces me to rephrase opinions as facts which is so utterly stupid and goes against the very essence of research and science. It is such a waste of time to have to do SIX weekly contributions with an average score of 95 to get full participation points! Also why is it not okay for us to us AI in our work but it is okay for instructors to use it for grading?

  
Second, WHAT IN THE WORLD WAS THAT FIRST MIDTERM? I got around 50% on most long answer questions which brought my overall midterm grade down to a 71%. We were given no class average, NO GRADING RUBRIC, no feedback, no justification for anything. I literally do not know what else I was supposed to say to get more than half points on those five questions worth 16 points each! For context, I finished PSY100 with 92%, have a 3.93CGPA, and got admitted into the psych specialist, so I don't think this grade is a reflection of my work ethic or study habits.

I contacted my TA (very politely, I'm not a monster) as soon as I saw my grade to ask how to improve for the next exam/what exactly was expected from our answers, but no answer. I subsequently contacted prof, who simply told me to contact my TA. I do not expect them to answer over the weekend, but now I have no idea how to study for the next midterm which is on Tuesday, and I feel like I'm exerting so much energy in vain. I'm also scared this class will tank my GPA.

  
Finally, the workload is crazy (I know it is summer, but it is way crazier than ECO220 which I am also currently taking) and it gets compounded by the way the material is presented. I often find myself having to re-watch parts of the lectures 2 or 3 times because the way information flows frankly makes no sense. The slides are so disorganized and uninformative, I have to jump back and forth to amend my notes as I watch the lecture videos because the concepts do not flow logically. The weekly activities are such a drag too, I do not own a printer and we constantly have to print stuff, buy stuff, etc. and then they get graded with absolutely zero feedback, so whenever I lose points I do not know why/how to improve. 

Anyway I would just find solace if I knew I wasn't alone feeling this way. Peace and love<3

  
TL;DR don't do summer school lol",submission,88

The audacity of your professor to blatantly use AI to grade you, when the AI is wrong to suggest that conditional statements shouldn't be used when they absolutely should be to describe provisional implications following study results, really feels like a gross bastardization and denigration of your education. 

If other students are feeling this way, I certainly implore you come together and bring up the issue to the professor in the first step of a formal complaint process. You absolutely do not pay exorbiant fees to be in a course that is graded by AI, nor do you pay to be in a course where you feel like you're not being given a fair chance to demonstrate your learning.",comment,45

Like unless the professor is naive and stupid, he cannot honestly expect most students to not use additional resources if there's zero chance of being caught, which means that the honest students are faced with quite the dillema.
