I will say if you aren’t interested in doing stats/cs you can get away with not taking any STA or CSC courses if you’re just interested in pure math and going to grad school. I didn’t take any of that or physics in first year (or at all during my degree) and just got all breadth done alongside the 2fce of math spec requirements and it was a lot of fun. That being said I did already know how to code (if you don’t then def learn it) and if you’re not totally committed to the spec it’s good to keep the back door open.,comment,1
