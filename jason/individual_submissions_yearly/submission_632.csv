He has the absolute WORST rubrics and by that I mean there is none. The midterm preparation he gave said ""there are 2 questions, answer them both"" and nothing else on the nature of what we would need to know or understand. And yes, I know for an English course there is only so much you can do beyond looking over the course material, but come on, he gave LITERALLY nothing. Yet even though he offers no rubric he seems to have very specific marking, which wouldn't even be that bad if he probably stated what he's looking for or atleast gave more opportunities for feedback. The only writing being the midterm and the end of term essay makes it incredibly difficult to understand what he's looking for without potentially doing poorly on something worth a large chunk of your grade. His lectures are also horrendous, he bases the entire thing on stretches that he can barely back up with evidence. I genuinely don't know how he even made it through his undergrad like this. He barely even considers other viewpoints and his quizzes always have SEVERAL correct answers on them, he just wants you to answer with what he said was the ""correct"" meaning. Several times he was genuinely rude to people asking questions or providina (perfectly reasonable and evidence based) opinions on the text, it was genuinely ridiculous. I don't know where he gets off teaching like this, it's horrific. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills in lecture when he goes off on some bullshit idea like it's fully factual. It's almost impressive how he can make such an interesting course so horrible. I would definitely avoid taking any course with him as a professor.",submission,31

Most of the courses I've taken that focus on contemporary literature have been absolute letdowns lmao. (That includes a fantasy course with Lesk btw, I fully endorse your post). 

Our curriculum leans towards a much more traditional approach (studying the canon, training with more pre-modern/early modern texts) and that's very much reflected in the institute's research interests. (i.e Old English dictionary project). Which, might be why the quality of lecturers drops off so heavily in courses that focus on anything after the nineteenth century.",comment,12

Like I have no words for how bad he is as a lecturer and as a person in general. He's very arrogant, condescending, and doesn't offer much as a lecturer.",comment,2
