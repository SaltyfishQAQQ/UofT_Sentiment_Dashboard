My name is Twoey and I work at Bikechain.

It would be fundamentally way better if you could get the bike for yourself for like a semester or smth. It's still very good though and I very much appreciate your work",comment,1

I'll include a slight correction: It's actually 2 weeks on, 1 week off. (ie. After you take out the bike for 2 weeks, you have a 1 week cool-down before you can rent it again, so other students can have a turn). It is certainly much more convenient just to have your own bike. But hey, our bike rentals are free, whereas renting a Bixi Bikeshare continuously for 2 weeks would cost you hundreds of dollars! 

Edit: Also, if you sign our petition, you can help us increase the number of lending bikes we have available!",comment,8
