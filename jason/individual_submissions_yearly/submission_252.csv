AND THEY'RE ALL 100+ SLIDES EACH. i have exactly 24 hours to study now because the final is at 7 PM but i know i'm gonna fr burn myself out this time if i properly study so what tf do i even do atp. i literally had ALL DAY OF YESTERDAY to study and i just bed rotted and i have never regretted something so much. this is all my fault and i'm so screwed but i don't want to just give up (i really do but then i'll end up crying my eyes out during the final so i can't actually give up) idk anymore i hate myself sm rn i just wanna go home and eat my mom's food. 

EDIT: THANK U EVERYONE FOR THE ADVICEðŸ©µ i ended up just sucking it up and forcing myself to go over all the slides and take notes which i started last night and continued today finishing an hour before the finalðŸ˜­ the final went pretty well but i do wish i spent some more time on some of the definitions but i was able to figure it out so iâ€™m happy :) the test wasnâ€™t as bad as i thought it would be lol and yes this is SOC100 ",submission,111

Through the clarity of hindsight and with no judgment - you gotta relax.  If you attend classes regularly and understand the concepts, you're most of the way there.  It's important to study hard, but you also need to rest!  A tired and stressed brain is one that will not perform well.",comment,77

McIvor is a great prof but he has unreasonably long powerpoints. you'll be fine if you don't go through all of it as long as you showed up to lectures.",comment,15

Usually for multiple choice tests, youâ€™re able to go with less sleep as you donâ€™t need to think critically as much in essays or math problems. Either way, since you were essentially resting all yesterday and hopefully didnâ€™t stay up late. You should be able to stay up studying late. 

Thereâ€™s no point to getting enough rest if you donâ€™t  know most or all of the content being tested. Itâ€™d be better to skim through everything first then make brief notes for each lecture. At times like this, you should keep asking either friends, google, chatgpt or textbook on any missing knowledge. If thereâ€™s a practise exam, use it to check for gaps in knowledge.

If you are planning on staying up late to study, regularly drink water and eat protein for energy. If you donâ€™t regularly feed yourself when staying up late studying, youâ€™ll probably crash hard in the morning. 

Remember, diamonds are formed under pressure and you have a full 24 hours to study for it. You can do this.",comment,4
