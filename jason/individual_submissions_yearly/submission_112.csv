Definitely email the course administration address or whatever email address is listed on the syllabus if you haven’t already. It seems like a lot of courses brought their 
B-team this year, as seen with MAT135 and BIO120 (although 135 is much worse as that one remains unresolved). ",comment,10

If it was an issue with the scanning device, it 100% could be cross-room. If it was an issue with a particular TA, it probably would be isolated to one room. We don’t know, so it’s worth checking. ",comment,4
