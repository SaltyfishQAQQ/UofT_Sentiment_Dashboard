Am I only one who feels like the professors are indifferent to students who want to pursue research opportunities? Or have I been just unlucky?,GooseOk1755,1cp9f40,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cp9f40/am_i_only_one_who_feels_like_the_professors_are/,1715402952.0,"I've been regularly sending emails not only to UofT professors but other profs in the US. As I should maintain/enhance the GPA and do the lab work (which should be realistically held on-site) AT THE SAME TIME, i feel like lab work at the UofT is the only realistic one for sure. (I'm not a US citizen nor Canadian). I've only been contacted from profs whose fields are I don't feel passionate about. I mean, i respect that and their work is brilliant. But I feel like they don't fit my future career and my studies. What makes me more frustrated is that I've been neglected/ghosted by profs i've been interested in whenever I reveal my interest towards their work as a volunteer opportunity.

I've been tailoring my cold emails concisely after receiving feedbacks from other redditors here but I don't know when I can get into the discipline that I am interested in :(

I feel like they see me as a useless mess and/or a potential competitor or something :(

I will take graduate school courses anyway, Do you think I should use the grades of the courses for my back? Am I just hurry? I mean, I don't wanna do undergrad like more than 8 years even after taking grad courses. Even if i take grad school courses and not get accepted to grad school, frankly speaking, I'm still an undergrad. That means I don't get grad degrees but just pours more times than the undergrad but the results I get is the same as undergrad.

How can I solve this mess? One of my friends told me she just read one paper of their lab and she got into that lab and she published her first conference paper. But WHY IS THIS SO HARD and HARSH TO ME? I couldn't even start building/ establish the solid research background for extracurricular",submission,24

The only way not to be a volunteer is to get a RA contract or to get some course credit (Eng PER requirement, thesis, project course, independent study etc). The first may not be possible because the faculty has no money for you. Money needs to be prioritized for PhDs and postdocs. Second, your department may not have the course credit for research culture.

If you are reaching to folks outside UofT, then what exact incentive do they have to respond to you? They likely have folks inside their universities who they will prioritize.",comment,20

You come across as entitled - and not really understanding the mentor/mentor relationship. A prof (in STEM) does not compete with trainees, but rather works to help them succeed - it’s only in our interest. If I receive an email that seems like the student is entitled, I’ll default to saying my lab is full/no funding. 

Funding in Canada is very competitive, and profs need to be very judicious about who they hire. So, you either have to stand out, or make a connection with a prof (office hours, etc). 

Another consideration is that most summer research positions are full by November. So you need to apply early. 

Have you tried work study? We hire a lot through there, and get some outstanding trainees.",comment,18

And this might sound harsh but also don’t be picky. People talk. Research skills are transferrable. Take what you can get right now, be good at it and keep applying for other (better) opportunities. Or better yet, ask the prof to introduce you to other better opportunities. They have the connection you don’t have yet. Leverage that. But you gotta show that you have potential and sometimes it’s not about your grades, it’s how pleasant you are to work with.",comment,5

I was rejected by the admissions committee once even though I had a prof who wanted to work with me and whom I had known for years.

OP, by the looks of it you are actually getting Profs replying, just not the ones you want? 

Also I really wouldn’t suggest you think they think you are a competitor as they are established profs so worlds apart. They would not feel threatened by you. If they take you on they want you to succeed because they are your mentor and advisor. Depending on the size of the program advisors are making a choice to spend a lot of time, and even research funds mentoring someone to be their colleague. 

Professors aren’t indifferent per se, but you might either be unlucky with matching profs who think you are a good candidate or align with their goals or they may be full up (profs have limits on how many they can accept).

I would say you need to figure out a research project that may interest them or what you would contribute to. Also, the profs who you said contacted you have actually contacted you and even if it isn’t the same as your exact interests, you could potentially suggest a project with them that aligns with your interests. Some profs want students to work with their focus others are happy to have students adapt methods or the like to a different kind of project. 

Also maybe take a break for a bit and come back to it fresh, it sounds like you are getting very stressed and irritated and that may come off wrong.",comment,6
