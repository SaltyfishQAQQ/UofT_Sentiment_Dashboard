One night for war games, one for a movie night, and the biggest one is for the general game night. You can play board games from their huge selection, play tabletop games like DnD, war games like Warhammer, etc and there's usually snacks and food. There's also a monthly BBQ with plenty of hot dogs and snacks for members. $20 for a full year of membership. It's my favorite club on campus and it has a lot of regulars. It also has a lot bigger range of ages than most clubs which means there are a lot of veteran members who have already graduated which is cool.",comment,28

There is a discord server I found through the student hubs feature on discord which gives all times and locations for the club. I would say the best way to start is to come in on a Friday (including summers) to the Student Commons and go to the 5th floor, starting at 6:30 pm and going until 11:00 pm. The club uses the entire 5th floor space and right as you enter from the door at the top of the stairs you should find a bunch of people setting up that can explain more. Lots of information about the club can be found if you google ""UofT tabletop"".

Once you actually decide to sign up, you just pay $20 to the front desk and you're a member. Your name gets added to a list of current members.",comment,6
