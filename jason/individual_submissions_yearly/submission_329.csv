"This is really random, but I’m still surprised some (or maybe all?) profs use Reddit",deleted,1ga2mi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ga2mi9/this_is_really_random_but_im_still_surprised_some/,1729659814.0,"I’ll start by saying that I don’t mean this in a disrespectful way or anything. It’s just really funny to see some professors commenting under certain posts in this subreddit sometimes (including the UTM and UTSC one)

I first discovered Reddit in my last year of high school because I was one of those students stressing and searching to see if I could get into UofT with my marks and what UofT was like. So this made me think Reddit was more student- or teen-oriented, I guess.

Since I saw professors as adults, I don’t know why, but it was easier for me to imagine them using Quora instead of Reddit.

I wonder if they’ve ever posted something on the UofT subreddit or what they think when they see our posts.

I’m so exited for reading week! Has anyone seen the new horror movies like Smile 2, terrifier 3 or the substance? I really want to go see them in the movie theatre. 

Finished my midterms and I was like, “oh well, seems like I’m cooked. Let me get something to eat”.",submission,80

My faculty has it's own subreddit. I never comment, but we monitor it to see what students are talking about, complaining about, etc. If we don't know something's wrong, we can't fix it, and students will complain to reddit before reaching out to staff. And sometimes, they tell exaggerated stories that have a lot of untruths- one was a student saying a requirement for a class was not included in the description. Which I know is a lie, because I added that course to the system myself.",comment,21
