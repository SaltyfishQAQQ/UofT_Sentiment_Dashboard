wonder what the motive is here. expand the capacity for the undergrad cs program? get more grad students? invest in the AI wave with AI profs? get profs to teach courses in areas where undergrad teaching is still weak? who knows",comment,35

For a t20 uni in cs, uoft has a pathetic selection of systems courses. They pretty much canceled csc469 due to lack of profs",comment,8

You have to have registrarial staff, you have to have student support people, you have to have access to residences.  If CS split from FAS they would no longer have immediate access to the colleges --- the incoming CS students would be in the same situation as incoming engineering students.  Engineering has a lot of infrastructure that the CS department doesn't currently have and that's not cheap or easy to build.   And that's just for taking care of students.  There are other costs involved in taking care of faculty and staff.",comment,13

Which kinda makes sense, the school doesn‚Äôt want the extra administrative overhead of CS being its own thing, which depending on how they go about it would might have zero practical difference but makes things more difficult for everyone else.",comment,6
