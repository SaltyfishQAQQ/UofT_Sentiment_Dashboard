Landing a job with ZERO work experience? Anyone else? ,Rough-Form6212,1d8ft9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d8ft9z/landing_a_job_with_zero_work_experience_anyone/,1717556561.0,"I basically wasted a lot of opportunity and graduated with zero experience. I'm not gonna lie, I struggled a lot with school and spent more time than my peers in my studies. Took like 2 - 3 courses a summer on average to catch up. 

I know job market is bad etc etc. I am not really here to listen to that but rather wondering if anyone else was in a similar place but someone found a way to land work. IN a practical way. ",submission,25

How’s your resume looking? Honestly there isn’t like anything crazy you can do to improve your odds aside from refining your resume and applying to as many jobs as humanely possible. Maybe there’s also in person job/networking fairs for your field you can attend?",comment,8

Get some skills and a reference from that. Don’t expect a killer salary off the bat. 

Take whatever you can get. Go from there. Started with customer service remote and now I do user research on product side. Gotta hustle and network now. LinkedIn is your friend",comment,6

They offer small remote 80-hour projects with companies, and you get a $1400 honorarium at the end. It's like a mini internship and designed for people who need work experience. 

I think you need to get on their wait list right now, but I've done a few projects with them and it helped me quite a bit. 

I've also heard great things about the Venture for Canada program although, I've never done it myself. 

The Gov of Canada also has a Youth Job bank that's great too.",comment,2

Open a name, start advertising, and all of a sudden you're a freelancer. Bonus points if you pick up a client or two. 

Looks good on the resume, and doesn't look like you're doing nothing.",comment,1
