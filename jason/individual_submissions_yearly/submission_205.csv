Anybody else's body just shut down during finals? ,Illustrious-Kiwi-194,1hgm0sb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hgm0sb/anybody_elses_body_just_shut_down_during_finals/,1734472773.0,"I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s wrong with me. Finals season arrives, and itâ€™s like my body just shuts downâ€”every single time. I donâ€™t even have many this year, just two. But it doesnâ€™t matter. After just one test, I feel like Iâ€™ve been in the trenches of World War I, battered and bruised. just constantly exhausted. I hate feeling this way.

First year, I would cry myself to sleepâ€”if I could even sleep. Most nights, I couldnâ€™t. I used to take whatever pills I could find just to knock myself out (I know, dangerous and stupid, but I was in pain and desperate). 

Second year was different, but not better. Finals came, and I slept 12 hours a day, yet I woke up more drained than ever. Nights were the worstâ€”lying in bed, staring into the dark, my mind racing through random thoughts. It was like my brain refused to cross that  line between consciousness and sleep. I would just lie like a corpse, and I still do this every time, just lie there like a corpse. 

Third year was hell. Back-to-back finals and I almost died. I studied all night for my last exam, and when I finally tried to take a nap, my heart was so loud, my heartbeat was all I could hear , loud and painful. I couldnâ€™t rest. I just lay there, uncomfortable. After that, I promised myself Iâ€™d never take last minute stress, and id be prepared and take care of myself. 

And Iâ€™ve tried. This year was supposed to be different. Iâ€™m not even stressedâ€”really, Iâ€™m not. I prepared in advance. I only have one final tomorrow. Itâ€™s an elective, not even a difficult course. And yet here I am, lying in bed like a lifeless shell, begging for sleep that wonâ€™t come. 

I donâ€™t drink caffeine. I donâ€™t do anything that should make this worse. Iâ€™ve taken care of myself this yearâ€”like I swore I would after everything that happened last year. But my body wonâ€™t listen. I feel like it's shut down. 

I slept for 12 hours this whole week, took 5 naps throughout the day. what is wrong with me. I don't have nay medical issues either. 

All I want is to get through the next 24 hours. Just 24 hours. Iâ€™m so, so tired. I want to close my eyes and never wake up again, but I cant even sleep when I want to ffs.  Anything to make this exhaustion stop.

Iâ€™m so tired. So, so tired. ive been tired for 4 years now....

The only difference from my situation is that I'm not as disciplined as you to even attempt to force myself to sleep so I usually just get myself really exhausted (30+ hours with no sleep) or (rarely) get really high/drunk/both. Maybe I should switch to sleeping pills for the sake of studying efficiency though,comment,24

Sometimes it triggers racing thoughts or exhaustion. I recommend talking to a professional because it really helps to understand whatâ€™s behind the fatigue, sleep issues, and anything else that makes life miserable when it gets stressful. I think knowing this, this self-awareness makes it much easier to cope with or get rid of it.",comment,5

I canâ€™t sleep when Iâ€™m stressed about something the next day, but if I donâ€™t sleep I always get sick. And Iâ€™ve tried a whole stack of things to help. All the herbal teas and essential oils, all bogus, doesnâ€™t help at all. What does help is l-theanine which is an amino acid from green tea, when I take it Iâ€™m just the same in focus but less tense/stressed. I like that this one doesnâ€™t actually make me drowsy since Iâ€™m often staying up late to study but I must sleep eventually, and it makes the stress less debilitating. Itâ€™s not like weed which makes you stop caring or alcohol which impairs your mental function. Also magnesium is helpful for the actual drowsiness part.",comment,1
