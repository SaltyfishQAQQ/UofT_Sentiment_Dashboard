usually a time sink and by the time they get back to you, most of your summer is gone.

For $ this summer, I would drop by YES, [Youth Employment Services](https://www.yes.on.ca/)

[UofT has career advisors](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/service/career-advising-appointments/) but I'm not sure if they're available to you before you start in September.

If YES is not convenient to where you live, then dropping by any [Employment Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/page/employment-ontario) agency will help you find work. It's a free service funded by the province. You can only sign up to one. Some have local connections to businesses who also get $ from the province to help train you. Their jobs are mostly listed on jobbank, a government run site.

There's also r/torontoJobs for more ideas. good luck!",comment,5

If you apply in person to a local business owned by your own ethnic group, it increases your chances of finding a job exponentially. I applied to around 30 minimum wage’s jobs over the past few months and even though I received interviews, people with better experience ended up getting the job. Once I got tired of applying online I decided to go in person to a Mexican restaurant and got a job opportunity on the spot.",comment,18

In general, there are two types: Graduate Student Library Assistant (GSLA) and Student Library Assistant (SLA)

GSLA usually requires MI or specific education background, and it is only for graduate students.

SLA is for undergrads and mostly do not need MI or library background. There will be an advantage if you are applying the library that is related to your studies.
