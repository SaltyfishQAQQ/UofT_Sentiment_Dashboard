long story short, I recieved a notification that someone used my debit card while I was at home (although I had my physical debit card with me). I’ve cancelled the card and disputed the charge, however, the only places where I spent money was on campus (UTSG) in the med science cafeteria (using apple pay). I’m not sure if anyone is in the same boat but just wanted everyone to be careful, even when tapping. 

stay safe!

I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around it as well but the only thing I bought this week was something from the caf. I’m not sure, just wanted to let you guys know.",comment,1
