BIO120 TA Hours (PhD) student is it 70hs or 140hs?,nymeriaamartell,1h9uyko,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h9uyko/bio120_ta_hours_phd_student_is_it_70hs_or_140hs/,1733697731.0,My spouse was a PhD student a few years ago ( 2019/2020/2021ish) who TA'd BIO120. He suffered a significant brain injury and I am applying CPP disability for him. The application is asking about work hours and I can't remember if he did 70 hours or 140. I know it was a heavier workload but I just can't remember. And with has email account deleted I can't go back and look at the offer letter. He doesn't remember that he was a PhD student so I can't ask him. Any help would be greatly appreciated!,submission,27

There‚Äôs a good chance I know your spouse. DM me and I might be able to help. I can‚Äôt open my contracts anymore, but I can point you to who might have them.

IIRC, it was around 70 but the number increased throughout the years to compensate for extra time needed to grade papers. Hours for marking TAs are different, and only the dept would know if he was a marking or a lab TA.",comment,10

Don‚Äôt write down the number of hours other TAs may have had. There may be differences even if typical base contracts are 140hrs etc.,comment,4

It's a sensitive topic (the TBI) and I have PTSD so I don't always like to call people on the phone and talk to them, or discuss what happened to him with people who knew him.

You should really work on your attitude. There was no reason for you to be so rude. You need to grow up.",comment,5
