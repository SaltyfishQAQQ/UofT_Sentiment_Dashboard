Commuters_How you guys keep yourself motivated for attending lectures??,Valuable-Appeal6910,1gag9y8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gag9y8/commuters_how_you_guys_keep_yourself_motivated/,1729704517.0,"I have a long commute to university, around 3:20 to 3:40 hours round-trip, and my schedule is quite unusual. Labs are bi-weekly, and I never have more than one lecture a day. Since the professors upload lecture recordings, I’ve started skipping classes  after attending consistently for the first five weeks(have missed 3 lecs so far) . I’m not used to missing lectures, and it’s been making me feel guilty. I’m worried that if I keep skipping, it might turn into a habit, and I’ll become lazy. The convenience of recorded lectures makes it tempting to continue skipping, and I fear I might end up avoiding all my classes altogether :(
So, I really need some tips on how to motivate myself for attending lectures.

When I posted my schedule on this sub, everyone was telling me “you’re cooked” because I have 4 hours straight of lectures on Wednesday, and 5 hours straight on Thursday, but I’m really glad I chose to do that. By cramming all of my lectures and tutorials back to back, I’m saving myself a shit ton of time, especially considering I’m the kind of person that will get absolutely nothing done with a 1 hour break.

Having back to back classes is really not that bad, and I can usually still pay attention even when I’m going on 5 hours. Try to schedule as many classes back to back as you can, it will make it more worthwhile to come to class. Bonus if you can get Fridays off (like I did)",comment,18

You will realize your performance is much better if you sit and attend a lecture. A 3:20 hour round trip needs to be alleviated somehow, that’s absurd if you have a long day (most of my days start at 9am and have lectures until 6pm). I could not imagine longer than 2 hours as a round trip. 


Either for next year look for closer accommodation OR schedule around your commute; ie, make it so you can use your commute as time for review and what not. And make it so you go to campus, get all your lecs done back to back and leave right away. I know this isn’t possible but try your best. Or just put a sacrificial day and see how much you can load onto that very day. 


NOW to answer question lol: 
My commute is 1:10hr each way and usually it’s not a problem with engineering schedules since it’s about 30hrs of class time per week. My best motivation is to simply pretend that lectures are not posted. Simple. And after first year, I’ve drilled it into my head that if I don’t attend the lecture — i’ll never fully learn it (ie i’ll just skip across the video or gaslight myself into thinking i get it).",comment,6

That way you don't feel painful when going to school; instead it feels more like hanging out with friends at the lecture hall, so to speak.

To be honest though, if the profs post lecture recordings, then performance-wise speaking, I don't think it's a bad idea at all to skip lectures, especially given your crazy commuting time. It's actually much more efficient to watch recordings, as long as you don't have an issue studying at home. (Or maybe if you do, go to some nearby libraries.) Going to lectures is more about getting in touch with people so that you don't get lonely throughout the semester; so the motivation really should be about people, not the course material.

If I were you, I would attend a few courses in person to get in touch with people, and skip the other courses. This way you get to waste less commuting time, study more efficiently, and also avoid feeling lonely.",comment,4

So by watching my recordings later I can pause, write everything I need down and then have my complete notes as opposed to having 50% to 75% of each slide. 
When I had in person lectures I would barely have anything written down; it was an absolute waste of time. 
I can’t even be seriously behind as our lecture recordings get deleted. So I guess as long as you actually watch your recordings and make your own notes it could be a lot more beneficial than in person lectures.",comment,3

Honestly, I've found that my performance suffers if I don't attend lectures. If I'm awake, dressed, and on campus, I'm paying attention. I'm domestic too and most of my fees are paid with grants, but it costs me at least $50/week to commute via GO Train and TTC, so I literally can't afford to *not* pay attention while I'm there. Most of my lectures aren't recorded (only 1/4 classes record), but I don't even touch recorded lectures just in case I get lazy with it.

I also wake up early everyday as I carpool with my family to get to the city by 9:00 AM (and commute home using TTC and GO train). 

Honestly I enjoy being on campus the whole day. Sometimes I AM exhausted, but most of the time being on campus actually motivates me to study. 

Also, you can get a part time job, or do volunteer work on campus/downtown in the spare time before your lectures. 

I don't recommend skipping lectures, you pay to go to them, and watching a recording is much different than actually sitting in lecture. Interacting or even just saying hi/asking questions with your professors is very important. They can help you get research positions/give you tips on how to get research positions, and they can even be a reference for you if needed. 

Basically find a routine for yourself, ask yourself what you are going to do with the time before/after your lectures and plan out your day. If you find yourself with more free time than you use, you can join a club, hangout with friends, get a part time job, or find a volunteer position. This stuff is all beneficial to you (either through mental well-being, or growing your resume and experiences).",comment,1

Maybe another alternative is to stay on campus for a bit and make the commute worth it by finishing any homework or review or prep you may need to do. Then go home and chill.",comment,1
