Losing presentation marks because the audience didn't participate? ,LakeshoreExplorer,1fsm1gn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fsm1gn/losing_presentation_marks_because_the_audience/,1727665894.0,"Hey guys I'm asking on behalf of a friend for a class they're in. 

The Professor posted this saying that if the audience does not ask enough questions then everyone in the class could lose 2% of their grade.

How can I lose marks if other people don't participate? Is that even allowed? 

This is exactly what the professor said:

The audience (i.e., those not presenting) must listen intently and be prepared to ask questions at the end of the presentation. Up to 2% of the entire class’s presentation grades may be deducted if there isn’t enough engagement during the discussion period.",submission,61

So it's possible that this is as fair game as group projects and seminar discussion grades can be (details depending). This is not to endorse the assignment -- there isn't enough info about the course or assignment here to do that, and this is third hand information at best -- just to outline a possible interpretation of what's in the post.",comment,31

I don't think this is entirely on presenter. I think this is a prompt for audience to be engaged and keep participating even though their presentations are done.
There are many ways to enforce this (especially for people presenting last/ later in the semester so they don't feel like an afterthought), some people require feedback forms (that are then assessed for quality and relevance of feedback), some randomly choose audience members to ask questions, some make it a collective responsibility.",comment,5

I’m sure it’ll go better than you think, the whole purpose of doing this is so that the audience actually argues or contests some of the presenters points. Which helps grade the depth of research and presentation capabilities of the students presenting. Without it, it’s basically writing an exam but not getting marked or assessed. 

Since everyone’s marks are on the line, you can bet at least a handful of students will be asking questions no matter what. 

And yes, this is totally fair. Its a valuable skill to know how to ask insightful questions and even more important to know how to answer them. A good example is during design presentations, if you come off as even a bit uncertain or provide an answer with no research/evidence to potential investors or customers, you and your design gets its reputation tossed.",comment,5

They won't lose marks if they don't get asked questions after their presentation. They'll lose marks if *they don't ask questions after other presentations*.

Presumably, there are more presentations they will sit through than ones they will give. They have a great deal of control over whether they ask questions during those presentations or not. They need to worry about paying attention and asking good questions (the thing they control), and not whether others pay attention and ask them good questions (something they don't directly control - though as others have mentioned, presentations can be structured to directly solicit audience engagement).",comment,3

Now, when I got my presentation graded the feedback was something like “you need to be more familiar with your topic”… complete nonsense because I learned my report by heart - since I actually wrote my own report it didn’t take too much effort. I didn’t fit in my presentation time limit, that’s true but I surely was familiar with my topic. 
More than 50% of my class were reading off their textbooks/ipads, etc. Not only were they reading, they were also so quiet that not a single person in the lab could actually make out what they were saying, it was also very evident that they were not so familiar with their topics or that someone else was doing both reports and presentation speeches for them.

I can't speak to the rubric, but the fact that it's an all or nothing situation--is, if no one asks questions, no one gets 2% participation--makes me think that this is the case. If someone shows up and is eager to ask questions and be involved, the Prof might waive that 2% for that individual.

I have not been called out by a professor in either of my two degrees. The last time an educator called me by name when I was unwilling or when I did not expect to speak was in high school. I do think it is rude to call out students like that, especially at the adult education level. It is also important to note that a professor and a student presenting are not the same, and the way a professor presents their lecture may not immediately appropriate for a student. 

I think it's important to distinguish between ""non-participating students"" and students who occasionally do not participate. There have been lectures and presentations where I didn't speak at all, and others where I wouldn't stop asking questions. People are not monolithic and it's a strange approach to pedagogy to treat them as such.
