Don't just memorize the steps to complete problems. They sometimes add little tricks on the tests so you'll lose points if you're just following memorized steps. 

Also do the practice tests so you know what to study. They're basically the exact same format as the tests. Same question types in the same order, just with slightly different details. 

Oh, and if you have tutorial quizzes, don't skip those. They're pretty much free marks.",comment,2
