Contacted 1 instructor for the course, who said Crowdmark shows you did not write the final exam (I did), and then said ask the instructor responsible for your instructor. I emailed instructor #2 but no response. Looks like my exam was misplaced or something, instructor #1 said that instructor #2 will have to go to the exam records and find my exam. Since I haven't gotten a response back, and assuming instructor #2 does not respond (does not have the best track record of responding to emails), who else can I go to to get this sorted out?",submission,99

Edit: I just saw your comment that you did an in person exam.

It gets confusing when they have upper and lower desks set up and have the same numbers, for example someone upstairs could be seated at seat 25 and so could someone downstairs. 

I take a photo of the exam paper (they always Place answer sheet down but don’t hand out the official exam when the clock starts). I do this incase they ever say I didn’t write it and I did. I also initial the bottom corner of each page, (it’s mind I licked it! Lol, JK).
