Even in a two-thousand dollar Canada Goose down jacket, you'll still be cold if you're only wearing a T-shirt underneath. Toronto isn't *that* cold, a peacoat for example is enough as long as you layer right. 

You also don't want to be too hot when you're indoors when you arrive to your destination. So it's good to layer with clothes you can easily air out or take on and off as needed, like a zip-up sweater/hoody. 

A good hat and scarf is a must, to protect your face and neck when the cold wind is blasting, Toronto isn't the coldest city but in the winter it's very windy. Ear muffs are a life saver on those wind chill days. 

You want to have a good pair of waterproof high boots with good traction, as the sidewalks on campus in the winter can get quite icy. We don't get much snow buildup in Toronto, so more often than not, you are navigating muddy and slushy conditions. Nothing ruins a day like cold wet socks. 

I recommend UniQlo's HEATTECH line of innerwear, it more than does the job and is affordable.",comment,55

You’ll be able to find pretty much everything you need, at a decent quality and discounted price. 

You’ll need warm socks - don’t cheap out on them. WATERPROOF, non slip boots. Socks are going to provide the majority of your warmth for your feet. If you’re planning on only being in Toronto in the winter you won’t need massive winter boots, as you probably won’t be trekking through too much snow. But there will be plenty of ice and you don’t want to slip. 

Winter Hat, scarf, gloves. Whatever you like and will be okay with actually wearing. You don’t need the big down gloves though, unless you plan on being outside and in the snow for extended periods. 

At least a couple of sweaters and long sleeve shirts for layering. 
Finally a decent quality winter jacket.",comment,6

The boots should be waterproof, and have some lining or insulation. I recommend Cougar for boots. 

Layer, layer, layer. Standard winter uniform is: thin inner layer, medium thickness outer layer, sweater or sweatshirt, and then your jacket. For example, a longsleeved tee, followed by a button up shirt, followed by a sweatshirt and then finally jacket. 

Good socks are a must! Longer socks up to the calf are good, ideally cotton.

Actually, Try to get cotton or cotton blend for as much of this as you can, as it’s more breathable. 

Check out Marshall’s and winners for a wide range of winter jackets. I like a good puffer that goes down to the knees, ideally with a hood. 

Also buy hand warmers! You can get them on amazon.",comment,4

Aside from buying your winter jacket for those very unusual cold days, I also recommend something lighter. Like a spring jacket kinda thing. 
I’ve survived last two winters with only one of those for most winter, and I don’t do layers, but that’s more a personal choice. 
You don’t need that many things really, try not to overdress!! It’s not like you’ll be outside all the time, you’ll be somewhere inside most of the time and there will be heating.

There is maybe two weeks out of the year that are cold enough to justify a thick, expensive goose down jacket (this doesn’t seem to stop people from wearing them in basically all weather though). The slush, mud, and wind are real. The downtown campus has a lot of wind tunnels, which amplify the windy conditions and coldness in the wintertime. 

I highly recommend looking for vintage Eddy Bauer or L.L. Bean winter coats on EBay. You can frequently find high quality, down puffer coats for under 100$. Tall boots don’t seem to be a huge concern, but something insulated and waterproof is ideal.",comment,1

If you have leather boots, wipe them down with a dry cloth, then apply a thin layer of dubbin wax with the cloth. A shoe brush is also a life saver and you can usually clean them well by just brushing them off. A decent pair of boots will last longer than your degree, if they’re kept clean and sealed. A mediocre pair that aren’t maintained will fall apart by spring.

Soon good wool socks will also keep your feet warm, even if your boots aren’t lined. Personally I prefer this way and find lined boots too warm.",comment,1
