Hello everyone, as the school year has come to a close and we're entering the summer I have been getting a lot of questions from undergraduate students I've mentored regarding applying for research positions. In terms of my own experience, I am currently a MSc student right now doing Parkinson's research at SickKids. In the past I have done wet lab research at UHN Krembil, clinical and dry lab research at CAMH, and paper writing at Toronto Western Hospital. I have constructed a brief and simple research guide along with the template I have used in the past for emailing as well as guidelines I followed when reaching out. It's still a bit messy so if any other students want to add their experience feel free to reach out. And if any undergrad students have any questions for me, feel free to respond to this thread and I will answer promptly. I wanted to share this because I know the process can be stressful and mundane but I believe in you all and hope this will help you even if its a bit! Nothing groundbreaking but just my own anecdotal advice :))",submission,73

The outside of academics… paragraph may not be necessary, and the time commitment paragraph could be shortened. Those are my only critiques though, otherwise I think this is a great resource!",comment,13

My personal tip for quicker responses is to email the post docs and lab technicians in the labs too. They'll likely have more time than the PI, and will response quicker. They won't have the power to hire you, but they're close enough to the PI so that you can meet the PI directly.

Again this is just my own experience. I wasn't hired for any positions, because I'm ""too young"" and the labs were bsl 2 labs. However, you do make great connections with these people.

Happy emailing : )",comment,3

Yes I would definitely agree it is a bit long too, that being said I guess I left the outside of academic paragraph in case anyone wanted to explain their other experiences for first time research. I 100% agree with your point, especially since some PIs may not take the time to read everything LOL",comment,4

For me personally, my GPA is what you would consider high and very competitive, however, I would say for PhD programs some have a minimum of 3.7 to apply directly from undergrad, for Masters its a pretty lenient at 3.3 minimum but I would definitely say that would not really be competitive unless you can make up with stellar research experience and extracurriculars. Usually yes, I would say that if your major is similar it would be easier to get into your masters just because there is more for you to relate to the program, however, it is not a huge limiting factor tbh",comment,2

For medical physiology my friend who applied got rejected with a GPA over 3.9 however a large chunk of programs are not too fixated around marks as long as you're not just at the bare minimum and have some experience and commitment to show. I would be hopeful and keep trying your best. 

As for labs it's like 50/50, some PIs don't care really care about your GPA at all as long as you have experience and stuff to show. They may filter out students who may be performing poorly however, as long as you're at a decent academic standpoint I don't think you'll experience too much issues. GPA isn't everything, passion and experience are equally as important for research!",comment,1
