From what I understand the protestors are demanding and I quote from a CBC report: “divest from assets that “sustain Israeli apartheid, occupation and illegal settlement of Palestine."" “ 

Let’s dig into the economics of this. Israel is a very very small market. Likely, it only makes up for a small sliver of the endowment portfolio. A tiny fraction that can be written off as a rounding error (that’s just how small the Israeli market is). 

I suspect that UofT’s endowment holds other questionable investments (forget about Israel, outside of that) such that they don’t want to release the make up of the portfolio. I bet as we speak, they’re probably working on cleaning it up a little in case they do have to make it public 😭",comment,93

Institutions that would rather use violence and police force against their own student body sooner than divesting funds from a foreign state that is actively committing war crimes and directly funding companies involved in weapons and arms sales with OUR tuition money. Anybody against anti-war protests needs to seriously re-evaluate themselves. Also, protests are meant to be disruptive against who they are protesting. That's kinda the whole point. Why do you think the TAs and other unionized staff were going to stop working, even if it meant the students would not receive the education they wanted? Because the institution was not fulfilling their rightful demands. This is no different. Actually, this is even more important. Regardless, the anti-war protests and encampments across campuses have all been peaceful and welcoming. The counter protestors are always the ones instigating hate and violence.

If the goal of the protestors is to stop all flow of international money into Israel, they’re barking up the wrong tree. What they want is an embargo against Israel. UofT or any of these companies can’t deliver that. Only the US government and other nation states can. So by that logic, the protestors should be camping out side the Parliament in Ottawa or White House if they truly want to achieve their goals. 

Another way to do the same is, to avoid using all services and products these companies provide. That’ll show em! But to do that, fully commit to it. And that would truly mean to throw out everything you own. Cause if you follow up the supply chain, everyone has the same multiple manufacturers (doesn’t matter what brand or company).

""Israeli companies"" and ""companies that sustain Israeli-Palestine apartheid"" are two *very* different definitions. Your original comment assumes the first, despite mentioning the protesters demands being the second. 

I agree that the economics of the situation is either completely negligible, or insanely expansive. Either way, unless these protesters *somehow* make the contents of the portfolio public, they won't know either way whether they had an effect. If the protesters aren't explicit about what they want, or their demands are completely unreasonable, why is UofT or anyone else going to be explicit about their actions, or explain things rationally?",comment,34

Pro-Palestinian protestors know that they cannot even hint at violence because they're already painted as terrorists and no one will listen to the cause if they show any aggression.

For the first point, I tried to figure out the difference between the two. The conclusion I landed on from other articles and discussions online is both are being used interchangeably. It’s really hard to quantify exactly how a company is “sustaining the Israel-Palestine apartheid”. There are some very direct examples like military companies that might be supplying weapons or construction firms based on Israel that are building in Palestine for the purposes of expanding Israeli influence. That is direct involvement. But how far are we really measuring this. Like the other person commented the list of companies, or the same list is being circulated online. Is now selling soap in Israel constitute as direct involvement in this conflict? Or is it every tax paying person or entity in Israel is being held accountable too? 

I don’t know the answer to the above.",comment,8

There have been widespread reports of workers having their documents seized so they can't leave, they couldn't get paid even if they wanted to. Workers being locked inside their employers homes and closets so they can't escape or call for help. The government there isn't just aware they've been complicit, with specific zoning laws and police patrols meant to fence in these workers before the world cup. 

An employer who steals your identification, doesn't let you move around the city freely, controls where you *must* live, deducting random amounts of money from pay under the guise of ""paying for rent and food"" (they have no other options) and forcing them to work in insanely hot conditions causing severe heat stroke without water or breaks, all of that absolutely meets the modern definition of slavery.",comment,19

Really odd that you think a country is supposed to help another country that elected terrorists into office who had a literal campaign promise to eradicate all Jews and destroy the whole country. 

Next you’ll tell me Hamas isn’t actually a terrorist group and that they want to live peacefully with the Jews. Is that also what you think?

Destruction of property - if you can even call it that - doesn't come close to police using excessive force on peaceful protestors, so I'm not sure why you shared it in response to my original comment. For every article you have about pro-Palestinian protestors barricading themselves inside a building, I can share 10 articles or videos in which counter-protestors purposely yell antisemitic slogans to make the students look bad. Or maybe I can share one of the 100 videos or photos I've seen of cops being unnecessarily violent.

Literally spent their whole lives under Hamas rule being taught their propaganda. Hamas runs every aspect of their lives and controls what information is taught in schools. Are you really trying to act like this group of people is going to have a *better* attitude towards Jews and Israel?

2) is that a joke? The terrorists who for about 20 years said their entire objective and reason for existing is to eradicate all Jews and obliterate Israel just had to say “oh hey people of Gaza, we actually wanna be chill with the Jews now, ok?We’re super chill now dw, we won’t try to kill them anymore, we promise”, and everybody just went *oh ok ya I believe that. Totally makes sense*.  Come on - Like that’s a really bad point to try to make. *Oh they wanted them all dead yesterday, but now they changed their mind.
