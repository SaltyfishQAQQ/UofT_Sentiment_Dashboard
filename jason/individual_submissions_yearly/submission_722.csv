And I saw these two dudes walking towards me. One of them is a naked big chubby Asian dude holding a football.
Don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs wrong with dude, we made eye contact. Then he just suddenly do a sideways fake with the ball into my direction. Like jumping towards me, then bounce back straight and walk past me. He‚Äôs one step away from plummeting me.

If you‚Äôre reading, what da freak is your problem dude ?? You‚Äôre like a twelves years old dribbling and blocking random people üíÄüíÄü§° Or you can‚Äôt stand people looking at you ??
And why are you showing your tummy on campus to the whole crowd. Have some self-consciousness dude. 

Anyways, maybe I‚Äôm overreacting but that‚Äôs weird asf. (Sorry if this is mean and if u didn‚Äôt mean to üòâ)",submission,26

If you want to get technical smaller towns tend to have worse drug problems per capita than cities. They just don't get included in major statistics because no one wants to filter through 20 towns they never heard of just to compare Toronto to Vancouver,comment,4
