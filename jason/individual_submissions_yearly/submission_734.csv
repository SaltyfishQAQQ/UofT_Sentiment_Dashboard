I had to move out of Toronto this week due to an unluckily situation and a bad landlord. I'm now staying with some family out of town, and it takes me about 2 hours to commute into Toronto.

I have an early morning exam tomorrow (Saturday) morning, and waking up early isn't exactly my strong suit. I'm worried about sleeping in or missing my exam. I was wondering if there's any affordable single night accommodations for students at UofT at all? Somewhere near campus I can just sleep for tonight to so I don't have to wake up at 6:00 and leave at 6:45 tomorrow morning?

I know some schools have single night accommodations for commuters but I can't find anything about it for UofT.",submission,24

I did see this posted in the Victoria University advertising a room for around $90+tax a night. You might want to give them a call given how late you are looking for a place to stay.
