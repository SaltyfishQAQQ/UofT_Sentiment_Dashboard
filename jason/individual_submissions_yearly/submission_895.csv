"Game Theory, Real Life Application: Why is ACORN so slow?",AmbitiousHonesty,1ecpk9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ecpk9c/game_theory_real_life_application_why_is_acorn_so/,1722004330.0,"TLDR: ACORN could have been fast. However if all students are thinking logically, ACORN being slow becomes an inevitable outcome.  
  
Assume that the average student has 2 devices, a phone and a laptop.  
Assume that 1 extra device attempting to log in to ACORN has negligible effect on ACORN loading speed.  
  
For each student, regardless of whether ACORN is slow or fast (i.e. regardless of what other students do), having 2 devices logged in to ACORN is safer than having 1 device logged in (in case one of them freezes). In addition, if ACORN is slow, having 2 device logged in would be much better, since you get to enrol in courses once one of the two loads.  
  
Suppose there are *n* students trying to log in. Most likely, the school would build the website to be capable of bearing *n* devices logging in. However according to game theory, there would be *2n* devices trying to log in, making ACORN slow, while everyone could have used only 1 device and make ACORN fast.",submission,18
