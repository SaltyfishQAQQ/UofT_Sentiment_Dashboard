WARNING to any prospective first year student applying to residence and getting a “Campus One” final offer,Novel_Western_9409,1co1fb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1co1fb1/warning_to_any_prospective_first_year_student/,1715272164.0,"Many students accepted to UofT and seeking residence admission will be given a “single and only offer” to go to Campus One near corner of College and Spadina, south of UofT’s main campus. Given the experience I had last year, I caution strongly against accepting this offer, for the following reasons:

1) you are forced to sign a One year lease instead of the 8 months at established, on campus residences. This means an extra $8000+ in rent costs. You will be told you can sublet for the following summer, but good luck with that - has only a 15% success rate.

2) meal plan costs (mandatory) are on average higher than traditional residences, the food is generally poor and they try to stick you with food costs next summer even when you are more likely not to be in residence. This is in addition to the forced extra 4 months of rent.

3) don’t be fooled by the “pick your roommates“ option. I’m sorry to say this but it leads often to “take it or leave it” situations where assigned roommates are ill-suited to your lifestyle and interests.

4) don’t be fooled either by the “amenities”. Yes there is a fitness centre and other things, but going to a commercial fitness centre or using UofT’s athletic facilities available to students is certainly cheaper. And do you really want to go to a “movie theatre” at your residence? Which btw is not that at all.

5) the advertised “on campus” location is BS. Yes, it is only a block south of the southern end of UofT’s campus, but it still a much longer walk to places like Robarts, most of your classrooms and athletic facilities than if you lived in traditional residence. You notice this running to classes and in negative 20 temps in January.",submission,183

i feel like because campusone is privately owned the management is just significantly worse than the uoft residences at least in my experience. the staff would always give me inconsistent info and they were just really difficult to work with",comment,16

I went to StG while the new building was still being constructed, it’s only far relative to some of the residences right in the middle of campus.

Distance wise it’s still pretty good. The only catch is the extra 4 months of rent, which isn’t the greatest. Could be extra incentive to find work in the city or with the uni during the summer.",comment,8

I lived by bloor and sherboune, a 30+ min walk to robarts thought worse parts of the city. i have friends who have 30 minute commutes by ttc as well, that 10 min walk to robarts is prolly good for you if its that difficult.

compared to alternatives, campus one’s biggest downsides are price and the longer lease. campus one also has better food the most residence dinning hall, but i recommend going to campus restaurants like sid smith or med sci over any dinning hall.

campus one has issues don’t get me wrong, but it is luxury living for most students in this city.",comment,15
