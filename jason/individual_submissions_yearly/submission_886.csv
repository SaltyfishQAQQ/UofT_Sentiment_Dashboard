Upgrade to a 4 year bachelor degree 20 years later? ,Potential-Wind8250,1g5javm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g5javm/upgrade_to_a_4_year_bachelor_degree_20_years_later/,1729141463.0,"I graduated from U of T in 2001 with a 3 year Bachelor of Arts. I always wanted to continue on but I had some family issues happening and was dealing with some significant depression. 
I finally have my life in order and have been looking at a masters program that I LOVE but it requires a 4 year degree. 
I have emailed this question to admissions but no answer. 
Does anyone know how I go about re-enrolling? Is it possible to upgrade my degree? Is there a time limit? (To be fair, it HAS been 23 years lol) 
Any help is greatly appreciated. ",submission,17

Based on your program and whether youâ€™ve been working in a related industry, I would also consider speaking with the academic advisor on whether you should reduce the workload/take summer courses for 4th year because you likely wonâ€™t recall the small details from your 3rd year course content, and might need extra time to relearn stuff. This just popped up in my head so feel free to ignore it if you already have a plan to address it or if the program is more laid backâ€“ good luck with reenrolling!!",comment,5

Iâ€™m not in your exact situation, but I returned as a non-degree student after 25 years and am quite confident you can do this.",comment,3
