Final grades are not out yet so I don’t know for sure, but how can I ensure that I can retake in the winter and move 2 courses to the summer? Do I stay put until January 6 or is action required on my end beforehand?  

Also, if anyone has any advice they can share, that would be much appreciated. I feel as though I’m in a very bad place mentally and I’m not sure how to bounce back from this. ",submission,24

So you’ll be able to take that at some point later. 

They let you retake calc 1 winter semester and calc 2 over the summer so you wouldn’t necessarily be set behind. Just make sure to make an appointment with an academic advisor in the new year to sort it all out.

And a last thing if you failed two courses are you sure engineering is the right place? Sometimes people find success in different things. I don’t know your circumstances and I won’t try to but the workload only gets way worse and way harder so if you struggle now you might be putting yourself into hell later.",comment,8

U of t used to allow you to register in 7 courses per semester then drop them if you pass. Other than that nothing can do until grades drop,comment,5

Being 100% honest with myself, I didn’t work as hard as I should have this semester. I didn’t go to as many office hours, I was going through a lot of mental health issues along with health issues to do with my mother, and I neglected my studies until finals came around. I’m in Civil Engineering and I truly am interested in the program. I know this sounds like wishful thinking, but I feel that if I work hard and stay consistent, I can do it.",comment,4

Many students are not as prepared for first year as others and so they fail and it’s why they have a protocol for handling it. They recover and move on. People that post about are you sure engineering is for you based on first year courses are just trying to get in your head. You’ll recover fine.,comment,2

As long as you’re truly motivated you’ll be able to get through it. I’m pretty sure civ second semester is a little easier I’ve heard you guys have a class on just rocks. CHE112 is pretty hard, our midterm average last year was 51% but the textbook for that course is amazing if you don’t get the concepts super well.

Failing in first year is great, if you only do it this once. You can catch up over the summer the same as everyone else and next year it’ll be as if nothing happened. If it happens in second year there aren’t repeat courses in the winter or summer so you have to wait a full year and essentially be a year behind your 2t8s. Use this as a learning experience so it doesn’t happen again",comment,2

If you are struggling with the concepts already everything builds on each other you will fail. If you’re struggling with workload maybe that’s something else but again you take 8 courses first semester you will be knocked off your feet and end up kicked out if on probation.,comment,1

I don't think this summers courses would be posted yet. 

Summer registration doesn't start till April or around there. 

If a wait list occurs for the course you failed and is a pre req they can't move you into the course. At least you'll be in them and can drop when things become certain in a few weeks.",comment,3
