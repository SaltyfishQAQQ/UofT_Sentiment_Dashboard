I completely understand wanting to 4.0 a course but tbh without an overhaul of ur study methods ur at a risk of repeating this. As much as it sucks to hear (trust i know) this is fr a learning opportunity and the study methods u develop now will care u through uni. anyways, i’m a neuro spec now so it all worked out and it will for u too, you still have time to pick yourself up! :)",comment,9

I’m a 3rd year in chem and my first uoft midterms hit me too and I still ended out with A’s in the classes i screwed up in.  As long as you really grind out the rest of the semester (midterms, assignments, etc) you can definitely still do well—a lot of the courses with two midterms will put more weight on the better grade and plus with first year life sci there’s usually a pretty decent curve at the end.

I would say with chemistry the best way to study is do any and every problem set/tutorial questions/practice tests they give you.  For bio and psych what worked best for me was flashcards and active recall, I often would find empty classrooms and just write all over the whiteboards.  What you can also do is if you are studying in a group, assign different bio/psych topics to each person and have them ‘teach’ it to you.  It really helps when u hear someone else explain it.  

Final thing that I would say helped me sooo much first year is get the past test packets from the ASSU in sid smith.  They’re usually 5 bucks max and they give you 3-4 past tests that can really give you a good idea of what to expect—plus sometimes some courses will reuse questions from those past tests.  You can also find some on the past test repository site but I would say the physical packets are best.

In short, you can definitely still get into majors that you’re interested as long as you put in the effort to finish these courses strong.  I ended up having to drop a course and retake it the summer after first year and I still got into the programs I wanted.  Most of my friend during first year struggled with the first midterm season, and we’ve all ended up ok lol.  My best advice is don’t worry too much about the grades, there’s nothing you can do about them now—you just have to focus on improving going forward!",comment,5

Once you have the lecture recording, you need to relisten to it and write down everything your Prof says on the slides.

Do any additional required readings.

Have all recordings and readings done 1 week prior to your exam, and review them during the semester as well.

Then study for a week. This will get you a 4.0",comment,3

Take it from a third year in life sci. But you'll probably need help reviewing your studying habits and techniques. 

Learning strategists are super helpful! They'll be able to review what you're doing and help you find what you could do instead. They're available through colleges and other departments like the CLSS or Faculty of Arts and Science. Alternatively, the peer mentors at the CLSS are also great, with the added bonus of them being students themselves.

This is *a* studying method but it rarely works (and is actually how I failed in first year). **Active recall and spaced repetition** are much more effective. The reason why I say your studying method rarely works is because it is extremely slow (even if you're typing) and it often leads to burnout. It is the most detailed method (you won't lose much if you essentially have a transcript of what your prof said) but it is inefficient and less effective.

u/LegitimateBook4226 , the best method is to finish the notetaking part quickly—ideally pay attention in classes. After classes are over, take some time to finish your notes while they're still fresh in your head.

Make flashcards using **Anki**. I still firmly believe that handwritten notes are better, but Anki is more effective than handwriting notes, anyways, and the flashcard making process will have to replace the handwritten part.

**Review Anki daily:** this will take care of the active recall and spaced repetition part. There is a reason why Anki is so beloved with medical students.

If you feel that Anki is not effective, making **mind maps** (to *understand* how everything is linked to each other) is also pretty decent (I usually make mindmaps to understand first, and then tackle Anki to memorize the finer details).

Often I find that first years (and myself) failed because:

* We equate a longer time studying = good studying, which is not true
* Longer time studying often meant (for me) that I wasn't able to do self-care things for myself, like sports, hobbies, etc. which affected my mental health and mood. I was a much better student when I prioritized sleep, happiness, etc.
* Notetaking (often, though not always) equated to **passive learning.**
* To me, there are two core caveats to being a good student: **understanding** the material and **retaining** the information for exams
   * **Understanding** is often linked to a mastery of what you've learned: can you answer the WHY question? Chances are, if your understanding is deep, you will not forget on the exam. If your understanding is surface level, you will not retain it as well.
   * **Retaining** is obviously important for exams. But notetaking and passive reviewing (e.g. re-reading the notes) does not often help with genuine retainment. Spaced repetition will help with this in the long run.

Not sure why you keep asking about a 4.0 but none of us can really answer that because we don't know your course breakdown. You should calculate it yourself and see if you can still get a 4.0.",comment,11

But anything over 3.5 gets you on the deans list. Above 3.3 means you graduate with distinction. Recruiters are aware how hard getting marks at UofT is. Change the way you approach studying. It won’t be that hard to get a decent gpa. I got a 66 on my first ever midterm at Rotman. I’m in the 3rd year with a 3.5+ gpa. I realized pretty soon what mistakes I was making while studying and I adapted. So will you and so does everyone else who really cares about making a change. Don’t forget your social life in between all this, approach your studying differently. If you’re focusing on passive reading, try writing out stuff in your own words - this is something that helps me. Make good notes. Refer to only your notes during the finals which you hopefully will have made by then. Good luck!",comment,2

GPA is forever. You can still finish with a very high GPA overall for your degree, but if you actually want that, you need to take this deadly serious. There is no ""future"" try, you won't be able to outrun your marks for grad and professional programs.

Your position right now isn't bad. If you take my advice from above you'll probably get straight 4.0s in your Bio related courses for the duration of your studies.

For better or for worse though, UofT does not nurture. I can't think of a worse school to provide any sense of reassurance or safety. This school rocks us to the core and expects us to find our way out. The healthcare worker side of me wants nothing more than to cheer OP on and reassure them, but based on the reality that I lived in, I think my response is very reflective of how this story concluded for me. I'm at crossroads between how I can (succinctly) reassure them, but also the pressure to warn them and expect them to buckle up quickly because I know how unforgiving this school can be.
