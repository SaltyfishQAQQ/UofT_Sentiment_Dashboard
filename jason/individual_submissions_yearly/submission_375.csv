feeling really down about my grades and this school is so unforgiving ,Over_Preference_624,1hh8hel,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hh8hel/feeling_really_down_about_my_grades_and_this/,1734547452.0,"I don‚Äôt really know what the point of this post is but I just wanted to get it out here I guess. I‚Äôve talked to a lot of friends about it but it still feels kinda bleak. I was a near 4.0 GPA student in first year (3.97, one 82 stole the 4.0 from me) and I got into both the programs I wanted to get to, one being quite competitive (Ethics, Society, and Law) but now I feel like either I didn‚Äôt deserve it or first year was painfully easy. 
I got sick at the beginning of this semester, missed a bunch of lectures as a result, missed midterms and make-up midterms so the weight got reshifted to my final in some cases, but I still couldn‚Äôt catch up. I‚Äôve never felt this physically ‚Äúunable‚Äù to do things; the fatigue was brutal, it was different from my usual laziness, no matter how hard I tried I just couldn‚Äôt force myself to do things. And then I got hit with back pain, and emotional issues since me and my boyfriend split. I had VOIs and an absence declaration but my profs still seemed cold about the entire situation, and I lost a lot of participation points. Because of my social anxiety and my sickness I ended up with almost no friends in any of my relevant classes, so I couldn‚Äôt get notes for the lectures I missed - and my profs said they wouldn‚Äôt provide them anyways, I had to ‚Äúask a friend‚Äù ‚Äî which I don‚Äôt have access to at the moment. I know I should‚Äôve talked to the registrar, I know I should‚Äôve seeked further accomodations, but everything just seemed so inaccessible and I had anxiety and now it‚Äôs too late. I‚Äôm not going to outright fail anything, but I‚Äôm expecting mid-70s for a bunch of my courses, which is below the standard I‚Äôve set for myself and I worry it‚Äôll screw my chances of getting into law school in the future; the OLSAS GPA scale is harsher than the UofT GPA scale and I really want to get into Osgoode (I‚Äôve already given up on UofT law, it‚Äôd be awesome but I‚Äôm not too optimistic). I‚Äôm getting mediocre grades back on essays I thought I was going to do well on (just got a 68 back on an essay worth 15% for a final I have tomorrow, which I‚Äôve barely been able to study for). It‚Äôs not that I don‚Äôt have friends, or support systems, or things that make me happy, I‚Äôm just really mad at myself for performing so mediocrely this semester and it‚Äôs kind of my first experience with academic underperformance. 
RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH idk what to do (: we ball i guess ",submission,66

There are accommodations at Accessible learning and u get lots from them at aims. Secondly I know how it feels to fail and loose everything and then u feel doubtful about everything u do. I was homeless once with kids midst covid and my cards were maxed out by my ex. It's hard to trust yourself and then putting some bar on u and a lot of expectations and not able to reach that point and beating urself up won't help. Take therapy see Dr if u are struggling with depression etc take accommodations. Reduce course load and try ur best. All u can do. If u need a friend we can chat when ever u want,comment,4

For 40 courses, you could have a 3.9175. The median GPA of the people that got into uoft law was 3.91, and this only includes the best 3 years of study, so this would give you even more wiggle room to bounce back and not have this affect your chances of getting into osgoode by too much.",comment,3

In my second year I got very sick, and I realized for the first time that if you‚Äôre sick there‚Äôs nothing you can do. Unless you‚Äôre able to study the classes at twice the speed for the same result, pushing things back will literally not benefit you. You have to drop courses or get a lower grade. Later on they realized that the illness was the beginning of a serious neurological condition. Nowadays I have access to just about all the accommodations, but it still doesn‚Äôt do anything if you know what I mean. You still have to finish all the assignments and tests in the same amount of time while being sick, you just are able to push something back a week if you‚Äôre extra sick. But then you have to do the next one in half the time.¬†

So my advice is don‚Äôt be too hard on yourself for not reaching out or doing more. Help IS inaccessible. The only real solution is to drop classes which also isn‚Äôt accessible for everyone given the cost of university.",comment,2

I started procrastinating, and then it got harder and harder to get myself to study. It seemed like fatigue and procrastination were gaining momentum. Once it gained momentum and the habit formed, it was really, really challenging to overcome it. I used to overthink my work, and despite wanting to do it, I didn‚Äôt actually take action.

What worked for me at the end of the day were two things: JUST DOING IT and not thinking about whether I wanted to do it or not, or whether it would turn out great or not!
The second lifesaver was changing my environment. I changed the environment so radically--I migrated, lol‚Äîbut it can be small changes, like going to different libraries to study.

I remember someone posted here that ‚ÄúAs long as you put 100% into things that matter, even if you fail, you will do amazing!‚Äù It is really relieving for me to think this way. I try to enjoy the process and avoid burnout at all costs because when it hits, it‚Äôs so hard to recover from. Then good results will happen without me forcing them.

I know it is hard not to regret the past and think that when you deviate from the ‚Äúperfect,‚Äù everything is over. But we should understand ourselves and accept what has already happened, we don‚Äôt have control over it and by overthinking it, we won‚Äôt gain anything but lose more.

Anyway, I wish you the best, and I hope you achieve the BEST you want!",comment,1

If you look at my transcript it is very obvious when I was having really bad physical and mental health issues, with having a severe chronic illness, vs feeling better (Talking mid to high 80s/low 90s vs 70s and some failed courses in second yr). I've felt a lot of what you're describing and I'm sorry you're going through hard times. I found, as did my friends, that second year can be weird and stressful. You feel like you should know what you're doing, but it's easy to burn out and to feel lost. That prof should've been willing to at least pass along the slides and not rely on students to share notes if you were sick and had documentation, but if there is still time I suggest asking anyone in the class that seems kind, most people are nice and willing to help out, as everyone's been there. You can also write the registar to ask for support. They can get you in touch with mental health resources, accessibilities, and academic advisors which I highly recommend (an advisor once helped me sort through a bunch of assignments I had to do and figure out how to complete it all, as well as write my profs to get some extra time or just to let them know). And if these were half year courses, even though it feels like it right now, it is not the end of the world. Those 70s will feel shitty, but then you'll get some help, pull yourself up, and continue to go forward and do better, and one day you'll look back and think ""I did what I was able to do, and I worked hard through a lot of issues to get that grade with everything going on."" I'm not in law, but I'm sure this won't mess up your chances, especially if you're able to do some volunteering, work, and keep trying your best to get good grades (my friends are in dietician and med routes and had some bad grades, but are doing very well!).",comment,1
