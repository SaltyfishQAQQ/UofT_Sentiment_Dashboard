How to actually get a good grade in ECO101 and ECO102,imgrenade_,1dy4isx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dy4isx/how_to_actually_get_a_good_grade_in_eco101_and/,1720430434.0,"# Background

  
I got a 93 in ECO101 and 82 in ECO102 and I'm here to help. Many of you are probably deciding if you should take ECO101 + ECO102 or ECO105, I was in the same boat as you a year ago. I strongly advise against taking ECO105, though my perspective is based on my friend's experience and you should probably take it with a grain of salt (I do not know a single person who has not failed ECO105, or dropped it, or did not cr/ncr it). Conversely, I know many peers who got 80's and 90s in ECO101 and ECO102. 

With that being said, ECO101 and ECO102 are massive commitments. You should **not** take these courses as electives unless you enjoy economics. If you need this course for programs like International Relations, you will be fine (probably), because I too have limited math background and did not study math at university. The last time i studied math was Grade 11. 

# Professors



ECO101 - Robert Gazalle  
Professor Gazalle is one of the best professors in the entire university. He will go over each concept clearly in his online videos and in-person problem-solving classes. I have heard mixed reviews at best regarding other professors and horrible experiences at worst - not worth the risk. Could you make sure you find a group in class that is good at studying, ideally sitting in the first row and working together for the crowdmark questions (You'll know more about this later)? Do not buy the textbook if you're in Gazalle's class; you won't need it.

ECO102 - Velekoop ( DO NOT TAKE TYLER PAUL )  
Tyler Paul is fine if you're coming to this university for a good time, not a long time. He will probably make jokes throughout the class, which keeps you engaged, but he is a new, inexperienced professor. While his teaching style is fine, he has barely any past papers and will test you on random things from the lecture slides to bring the course average down. I had to correct the professor on a question he had in the midterm, which needed to be corrected. My points were deducted from the exam, though this was eventually regraded, and I was given full marks in that question. II guess it sucks to be the person who didn't realize that the professor was wrong and probably thought that they were answering it incorrectly.

# Weekly Work

  
MOST IMPORTANT: FIGURE OUT HOW EQUASIONS OF LINES WORK. IF YOU UNDERSTAND Y=MX+C, ECO101 WILL BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY EASIER. 

1. Solve the practice questions and the weekly graded quizes. Make sure to do the quizzes and get over 50% in each; in Gazalles class, if you got more than a 50%, you got a 100%. These quizzes are good for practice.
2. Go to Tutorials and find a good TA. I had Heather last year, and she was an outstanding TA; try to get her if she still teaches this semester. If she isn't there, try to go to one of the better TAs (you can go to any section since tutorials aren't graded). Tutorials will teach you how to solve questions mathematically and are arguably just as important as lectures. Miss these or waste them, and you will probably fail.
3. Iclicker/crowdmark - Free points, make sure to get each and every one of them. DONT WASTE THIS.
4. Notes - I didn't take notes during ECO101 that I would later use extensively, but I came to regret this. I made the same mistake in ECO102. If required, I recommend taking notes of the equations, formulas, abbreviations, and definitions. 
5. Make sure you watch ECO101 online videos before the lectures. Gazalle posts videos that explain the concepts, and he holds ""workshops"" in class where he teaches you how to solve the questions. If you dont understand the concepts prior to the workshops, you will not be able to understand what's going on in class. 
6. Make sure you go over the random casestudies Gazalle posts. They will randomly ask questions from those. 

# Before the midterms / exams 

1. **Past Papers.** Non-neogitable. Doing all the past-papers available to you is mandatory if you want a good grade. Doing these will not gurantee you get a good grades, but not doing these will **probably** gurantee you a bad one. 
2. Tutorial Revisisions. Negotiable, especially if your concepts are clear. 
3. Revision lectures in 101 are non-negoitiable. Alot of concepts are clarified, sometimes questions from revision lectures (not held during class time) will show up in the final. Revision lectures in 102 are negotiable if they just go over the practise exam and post those online. If they dont post them online, id recommend attending. 

# After the midterms

1. Got a good Grade, celebrate. Got a bad grade, dont get depressed. Econ will give you plenty of opportunities to make up for it given the various ways to earn points. 
2. Go over the past papers. Your exams will be scanned and uploaded on crowdmark where you will be able to see exactly where you lost points and the reasons for it. Most of the times TA's will be underpaid and overworked, and will give incorrect reasons for deducting points. I have been regraded in every single Econ midterm in 101 and 102 because TA's will probably make small mistakes in the grading somewhere or the other. I have gained as high as 10% through regrades. Make sure you quote from lectures and/or marking scheme and directly point towards why you are right and the TA is wrong. There will be instances where you have fulfilled the requirements for 3/6 marks but only got 2, ASK FOR THAT ONE MARK BUT BE HUMBLE WITH IT. 
3. Continue working hard. Practise, practise and practise. Practise truly makes perfect in econ. 

  
TLDR; take eco101 and eco102 instead of eco105; Get Gazalle for 101, Velekoop for 102. Go through material before lectures, and tutorials. Figure out how Y=MX+C works, through youtube if necessary, or go to Math center or Econ center. Do the practise questions. Go to tutorials. Do the quizes and get the free marks. Dedicate HOURS to econ. Past papers are the best way to figure out where you are going wrong and how to fix it.

One other thing would be to try to understand HOW the concepts work rather than WHAT the concepts are. Memorising formulas can only do so much if you don’t know how they are used. 

Understanding why they work also helps with understanding the previous concepts too (since concepts build on one another). I’d say that was my biggest boon while doing 101 and especially 102.",comment,3
