I'm not a UofT student so he gave me his card and I swiped and he said he forgot his card. Yea, we got caught, but the thing is that the security took his card after and my friend panicked and grabbed his card from them. From there we just left. Truly it was a dumb move which escalated the situation but do y'all know what the consequences are? Thanks in advance.

You are fine. The security people aren't actually by the university. The university is mostly hiring some third party companies, and their consistency and policies is scarce. 

The worst case is that you will receive a small warning from the university which I highly doubt. In that case, what would be the consequences. It is not an offence for which you would be expelled or fined.",comment,5

Access with your TCard is highly regulated. For example, CS students get access to Bahen only while they are students. Similarly, it’s not that “students at the time” were “add[ed] to the new database,” but rather that the system automatically grants you access as long as you are a student. There is no “database” of people allowed into Robarts; there is a database of you as a student along with your enrolment status. Similarly, not paying incidentals will cut your access to the gyms.


The only reason why you were let in is probably because they thought you were either staff or a student.",comment,1
