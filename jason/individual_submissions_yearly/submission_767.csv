It says you have to satisfy all of the requirements in a row to be rewarded by that grade. By that logic half of the students will fail due to the diabolical questions in the make connections part. My question here is, what is the exact way of grading in this class? Anyone here understand the syllabus to break it down for me? cuz it doesn‚Äôt make any sense if they wanna pick the lowest mark even if you did great in ACT and demonstrate ",submission,22

I'm not associated with the course at UTSG in any way, but as far as I can see from googling the syllabus, there's a pretty clear table that lays out exactly what you need to do to achieve each letter grade, then half a page below that lays out how your exact percentage grade is computed within that letter grade. 

In general, this is an example of ""standards-based grading"" (I think that's the jargon for it). It lays out explicitly what you need to do to get a given grade.",comment,1

In that case if you even ace two parts but messed up the third one your letter grade will be based on the third one even if you got both straight A in the first two. I got this part and know it‚Äôs truly unfair, but my question here is how they gonna add the badges when we have 3 different grades? Are they going to add it to the lowest one?",comment,1

Mat135 grading disaster and it‚Äôs horrendous syllabus ,cromonolith,m1m8bpp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hbiu28/mat135_grading_disaster_and_its_horrendous/m1m8bpp/,1733963871.0,"Again, the table there says exactly what three things you need to do to achieve each letter grade. If you do two of those things but not the third, you haven't achieved the standard. 

The idea is that to get a certain grade, you have to demonstrate a certain level of competence in each of the core components of the course. 

Even if you think that isn't a *kind* way of assigning grades, it appears to be very clear what you have to do. It doesn't seem particularly unfair to me; they're assessing you on three core things, and do well in the course you have to do well on all three things. Someone who does two of the things well and not the third hasn't done well in the course. 

As for your latter question about badges, the syllabus answers your question explicitly. You don't have three different grades; you have three different components that you use to figure out what letter grade you start at according to that table. 

Then you start at the median percentage for that letter grade (e.g., 74% for a B) and modify with badges from there. So for example if you earn a B according to the table, and also earn 2 badges, you'll get 74 + 2 = 76%. A C with no badges gets 64 - 2 = 62%, an A with 4 badges gets 87 + 6 = 93%, etc. 

It's all explained in the space of one page, and I'm looking at this document for the first time today.",comment,1
