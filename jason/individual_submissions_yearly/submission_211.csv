"This past May, I threw out about $1000 worth of textbooks, and I am cringing so hard right now",deleted,1dkd1vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dkd1vn/this_past_may_i_threw_out_about_1000_worth_of/,1718893821.0,"Former CS specialist here, graduated back in 2020 from St George (although I am back at UofT for more). This past May, I had a psychotic fit, and I ended up throwing out some cherished textbooks, including possibly the best book I ever read, ""Scientific Computing: An Introductory Survey"" by Heath- the text for CSC336. And it's strange to say this, but as my mental health has been improving over the past few months, to the point where I feel the best I've ever felt for my entire adult life, I feel genuine sadness over what I did, as if I kicked a dog or something. It's truly a waste of valuable, well-written books, books that have made me the scientist that I am today. Eh, what can I do, besides live and learn? Hehe. 

Luckily I did spare one book from my psychosis, and it's thankfully a very nice book that I still use these days. It's called ""Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis"" written by Johnson and Wichern.

PS this wasn't the only stupid thing I did due to mental illness.  Back in 2022, for example, I sold off my beloved Gibson Les Paul Standard for about $1800 less than what I paid for it, just for some quick alcohol money. The pandemic has really chewed me up good :( ",submission,134

If you don't have a shelf then buy one, then put the books up.

I'd rather have my undergrad texts in sight than my diploma, serves as a far stronger reminder of what you've actually accomplished than the framed certificate.

Word to future graduates: NEVER sell your books, especially if your program was hard

Edit: also good to hear you're doing better now, congrats",comment,9
