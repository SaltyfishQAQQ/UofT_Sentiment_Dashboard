Random 3am thoughts about school and my current (social) life ,deleted,1fxat1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fxat1x/random_3am_thoughts_about_school_and_my_current/,1728198304.0,"lol, I don‚Äôt even know what I want to say.

Midterms are coming up and I‚Äôm just really behind, I can‚Äôt even do anything about it right now because I‚Äôm sick. 

I feel like I was burnt out before coming to university. Has anyone ever felt like all the problems you used to gloss over and hide just hit you like a brick when you enter university? It‚Äôs my second year and I still feel the same.

I kind of miss my childhood, I don‚Äôt even want much, I just don‚Äôt want to worry about tomorrow and have a comfortable place I can live in, maybe have a cat or a dog and have movie night even weekend while eating a huge bowl of ice cream and a packet of chips.

I also want to go out and not really think about what people think about me. Am I dressed okay? Are they laughing at me? Is there something on my face? Sometimes it‚Äôs not just ‚Äúoh, people don‚Äôt care about that kind of stuff‚Äù, the issue here is that that‚Äôs how I feel, I analyze myself from an outsides perspective.

I kind of feel sorry for my profs, I‚Äôm pretty sure in the one who brings their class average down, I just want them to know that they are good profs. I love their classes, I just can‚Äôt seem to put in the work. 

I use to want to have some friends, now I don‚Äôt really think too much about it. I probably got used to it. I can got to the movies or restaurant by myself and watch a good tv show. People come and go, it just feels kind of silly how I used to imagine university as a kind of place I‚Äôd get to experience bunch of stuff.

I miss my family a lot, at least I know I could always run to my mom or Dad to have a huge warm hug. They were strict when it concerned studies, but they did love me.

Do you think they‚Äôll ever finish construction at UofT? 

I‚Äôm happy the front campus is open now tho.

 

There are so many nice TAs at UofT, shoutout to all the TAs I‚Äôve ever met, I‚Äôm pretty I wasn‚Äôt making any sense but just you smiling was nice

No one is talking about the pizza place in front of the student commons, their pizza is just delicious.

I think I should sleep.

That‚Äôs how my head works all the time

Also, can some tell me when the new season of Hunter x Hunter is coming out?

Like a wise prof once said, ‚ÄúGo‚Äù

I‚Äôm going to go sleep but that‚Äôs not for you, study for your midterm.",submission,114

I'm just a stranger on the internet, but a couple things that stood out to me were:
 
* A lot of different thoughts, followed by ""that's how my brain works all the time""
* Liking your courses and wanting to do the work, but not being able to get yourself to do it 
* Hypersensitivity to others' perceptions of you
* Feeling burnt out and like things that were ""fine"" before are now catching up to you

Maybe you don't have it, but if you're struggling it might be worth investigating.

Sincerely,
Someone whose life would have been so much easier if they'd gotten an ADHD diagnosis in undergrad rather than 5 years later",comment,6

I also got sick right by midterm, make sure to take care of yourself. I am also burnt out and the consequences of not doing work have a much bigger impact than high-school since teachers don‚Äôt try to accommodate for you. I also feel homesick but don‚Äôt worry. Try to find people around you to support you while you do your undergrad like friends and be sure to get some phsyical activity to help with your mental. Also make sure to talk to your family whenever you have time through calls. And don‚Äôt feel sorry about bringing class average down.

The manga chapters have just started back up a couple days ago cause the author regularly takes hiatuses, so the ending of the anime is not toooo far off from where the manga continues on from that point, but definitely enough content and new characters to build up your interest all over again. There‚Äôs a guy called new world reviews who makes the best hxh content I‚Äôve ever seen.

Also you‚Äôre completely valid in feeling that way. It does get a little easier when you get used to everything along with sometimes getting out of your comfort zone. Happens to a lot of us down the line so try not to feel too alienated in that regard. All in all, I hope you the best of luck for the remainder of university.",comment,3

I just wanted to say, first and foremost, that I‚Äôve been a causal onlooker on Reddit for years, and since I‚Äôve started Uni this fall I‚Äôve also naturally started browsing UofT subreddits.

I‚Äôve seen many ‚Äúburnt-out‚Äù posts here and while I did empathize with them my prominent emotional response is to skip them simply because I don‚Äôt want to amplify my sadness, stress etc.

However, when I came upon your post something about it stood out to me and I think it‚Äôs because it literally feels like you took some of my thoughts and feelings straight from my brain and wrote it here. I felt really connected to you, so much so I decided to create an account today haha.

I also feel that maybe it‚Äôs time to actually make my trauma, suffering and experiences into something meaningful. If I can reach out and help someone even one person, maybe I can leave a tiny mark in the history and wide expanse of the universe.

Anywayssss, the most important thing I want you right now to know is that:

**you have been heard and you‚Äôre not alone**.

And depending on your emotional state, this can bring some light to your spirit or make your eyes roll. But regardless, I think two things are so so important to keep in mind.",comment,2

Maybe some stress can be relieved with a walk outside and some music, but often bigger and tougher problems require introspection, time, dedication and- annoyingly so- hope, faith and love.¬†

Even then, and I don‚Äôt mean to depress you, but some things, you ultimately have to learn how to mange/deal with/live with. Just in the same way someone with a physical disability has to learn to live with a hearing impairment or an amputated leg, you have to learn deal with, for instance, a mental illness or the loss of somebody.

But the good thing to take from this, is that YES. Things CAN be done and that other people have felt like you do and are willing to help you out!üíï",comment,2

I‚Äôve always felt like the weird and quiet kid and that was hard enough, but then when my life started being plagued by mental illnesses and other sh!t, my life felt like an eternal storm, or a black hole or one big f!cking joke. Sometimes all at once.

Now that I‚Äôm sort of in an impasse,¬†¬†and where I don‚Äôt know who I am really or what i want ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm just sort of going through the motions of trying to be a productive student. I feel so out of place though, and I also feel like all my trauma and issues can so easily flood back into my life if I take the wrong step. Uni has definitely triggered my depression and it might not take that much to relapse into other things. And it‚Äôs hard to be ‚Äúbetter‚Äù and improve myself, because all these things have affect and/or affect how i think, feel, socialize. How do you make friends when you‚Äôre so insecure and maybe even hate yourself? How do you when you never really had friends before? How do you when all other aspects of your life are crashing down on you?¬†

And also things or people that can help you like family are a double-edge sword. They help you, but also sometimes the trauma comes FROM them or your trauma revolves around them indirectly, like it‚Äôs not their fault but they bring about a lot of emotions or thoughts.¬†

I wish, so badly, too i can go back in time‚Ä¶ have another chance. I felt like my childhood was taken away from me and that part of the reason‚Ä¶ is my fault. Even dumb things like prom or relationships‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get to experience.",comment,2

But I felt like I needed to tell you this so you know I‚Äôm not bullsh!thing you when I tell you I‚Äôve been low, LOW low.

That‚Äôs not even the surface of it.

And even so Im still trying to do something about it and I want to motivate you, too.

This uni is taking a lot of your moolah so you better milk UofT for what it‚Äôs worth. Just do it.¬†¬†Just go to the health and wellness centre and boom make an appointment. They have all these services and whatnot at your disposal, don‚Äôt let it go to waste. Even if it doesn‚Äôt work out, at least you tried, even just talking about can help a little. That‚Äôs what I did, just last week even! Despite the mountain of reservations I have because trust me when I say: I‚Äôve been through dozzenssss of therapy and all its forms, and most recently I‚Äôm even recovering from an unhealthy therapy relationship I can‚Äôt seem to move past fromüòû but yeah just go, or even to your family doctor or even research online if you like- it might be eligible for OHIP so you don‚Äôt have to worry about affording it or whatever.",comment,2

I know somebody who didn‚Äôt realize they were suffering from it¬†¬†and they were having such hell with their education and stuff and somebody else mentioned to them to check that out! And go figure they had it, got medication and now they‚Äôre thriving!

It‚Äôs something I even am interested in checking out but my symptoms have change so I don‚Äôt feel like I fit exactly anymore but still. I don‚Äôt know the whole process but check online or again book an appointment with UofT and I‚Äôm sure they can guide you!  


With your ta‚Äôs and even profs. Don‚Äôt be too hesitant in reaching out, even if there might be some jerks, remember that they were once students once, heck some of the TAs are student themselves (masters) and are wiling to lend a hand, you just need to show them that you do care.They have hundreds of students and unfortunately, you will blur with the whole bunch unless you reach out. I did with one and it‚Äôs nice to know that someone actually wants to help me pass and learn

Finally midterms‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs a saying I saw recently and I‚Äôm so mad cause I can‚Äôt find it and I don‚Äôt remember the wording but the essence of it was tomorrow starts today. Until that midterm is in front of your face, you have time! ( actually I should be studying rn shhhhh) Go and do it all! Go read the text book, watch the lectures, participate in the FSGs if you have them, go to the learning centre, email your questions, YouTube if the damn slideshow doesn‚Äôt make any sense‚Ä¶ just do it. And if that‚Äôs overwhelming just go to Quercus and pick a course and pick a lesson and time yourself for 20 minutes. Don‚Äôt go on your phone, don‚Äôt be around family or friends( no distractions), and just study. Hey, maybe you‚Äôll find ‚Äúhey, I can do those for another 20 minutes‚Äù and so on.",comment,2

I wasn‚Äôt really planning on commenting after I made the post because once again, this was a 3am thought/rant, I was sick and my thoughts were all over the place. However, it is true that all of what I wrote were my true feelings.

I just want to start by thank you and the everyone who commented under this post, I should edit the post, but I‚Äôm a little lazy right now. There‚Äôs always this nice giddy feeling when you find people who relate to you and who want to help. 

I read everything, since I‚Äôm more of a reader than a writer, I‚Äôm happy you could connect to me and I do appreciate sharing your story too - or at least part of it. Sometimes we can gloss over things, other times even when we can‚Äôt we have to learn how to deal and live with it and the other times, we have to sit and look in ourselves - just like you said. 

I‚Äôve thought a lot about it, this problem of mine isn‚Äôt a recent one, it may have been from my childhood and it was just there, growing and eating me up without me realizing it and it‚Äôs affected me a lot in my first year and it‚Äôs doing the same in my second year, which I can‚Äôt afford.

So yes, just like you said, while I‚Äôm still here, I should milk UofT from what it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôm slow, but I‚Äôll definitely go to the health and wellness centre to have some checkups and look into ADHD  too. I don‚Äôt wish to have it, but it‚Äôs not like people actively want to have it. 

Truth to be told, I did reach out to one of my profs and he said I should come to office hours and he‚Äôll help, unfortunately I haven‚Äôt been able to go to class for the past couple of weeks, first because‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt really know and then my sickness it came and I was stuck at home. I‚Äôll be going back to school tomorrow and I‚Äôll make sure I don‚Äôt fall back into my bad habits again. 

It‚Äôs was a real pleasure reading everything you wrote, thank you for making it clear that I‚Äôve been heard, if it‚Äôs okay, can I return those words to you? You‚Äôve been heard too and I really really really do pray that you can work on your trauma. You said you were going for therapy because of an unhealthy relationship, I hope you can work it out. I‚Äôm not experienced in this, but I do know it takes a lot of time and patience and will. 

I could feel you for the socializing aspect too, honestly l, at some point it becomes tiring, so this is one of the things I‚Äôve left to time and life. Sometimes things are easier when you don‚Äôt think too much about it. 

As for my midterm‚Ä¶ I have one soon, but I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to write it, but I do have another one this week, I‚Äôll put my all in that one. I too want to be happy about my results. 

Currently I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll be able to DM you, but I‚Äôll reach out one day! 

Thank you again for your kind words, I do feel much better now. I hope you have a great day and do study for your exam, good luck!",comment,1

I was already going on a thought spiral and I was to myself: *omg why would you share that? It‚Äôs forever on the internet!* *You‚Äôre just embarrassing yourself. People aren't going to read that and if they do, they‚Äòll just laugh at you. You keep wasting time, this was a waste of time and all you do is fail fail fail‚Ä¶* üòÖ yeah there‚Äôs a little a\\snapshot of my mind for ya.

  
i get not wanting to confirm if you have ADHD or not, it‚Äôs sort of like a Schr√∂dinger‚Äòs situation‚Ä¶ as long as you don‚Äôt confirm it, you can tell yourself you‚Äòre ‚Äúokay‚Äù and you have no issues.

  
also don‚Äôt forget some profs are willing to zoom/video call you. I know you said you‚Äôre going tomorrow, but you might still be feeling kinda shi!tty and want to go back to dorms/home/ wherever as soon as possible but that way you have more options.

and thank you again for returning the words back to me, although I meant i had an unhealthy relationship with the actual therapist üôÉ so it makes seeking professional help even harder for me.

  
and don‚Äôt worry, message me when you are 90% to  ready and I say 90% because sometimes you just have to take a ‚Äúleap of faith‚Äù and go for it, otherwise you‚Äôll never ever do it‚Ä¶ at least that‚Äôs how it is for most insecure/over-thinker/procrastinators such as myself.
