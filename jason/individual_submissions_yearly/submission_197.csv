If it‚Äôs your first deferral, fairly sure they will grant it for a train delay (or anything actually). Don‚Äôt take long to start the process. Also email your prof to ensure they know as well.

Just note in the future usually it‚Äôs a smart idea to catch 1-2 trains earlier than normal. You may get there an hour in advance, but at least you won‚Äôt be in your current situation now.",comment,14
