achievement: body successfully gaslit into having decent sleep schedue,Vegetable-Anybody112,1hgz111,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hgz111/achievement_body_successfully_gaslit_into_having/,1734518800.0,"just a tiny achievment that i was able to accomplish. normally i go to bed at like 12, doomscroll till 4 or 5, wake up at 1, start my day at 2. but that’s 5 hours everyday im just wasting simply from doomscrolling and texting.  and i only get to see 2 hours of sun a day. that’s probably not good for my mental health.

the day before yesterday i woke up at 1pm as usual but i also tired the fuc out of myself and went to sleep at 12. unfortunately my body thought i was taking a nap and i woke up at 2. i couldn’t go to sleep so i just started playing games/studying. i spent the day making myself as tired as possible on 2 hours of sleep without taking a single nap. i studied, i jogged around campus, i did my laundry, and i was dead by 9pm. i went to bed at 9 and somehow slept till 5!!!

this might sound like a small achievement but im so proud of how i managed to completely gaslight my body into sleeping at normal times in just 2 days!!!!!",submission,64
