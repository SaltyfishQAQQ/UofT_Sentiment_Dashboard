Are you sure of this? I find math courses have far clearer expectations and course content. They have 'suggested problems' from the textbook you're supposed to *solve*, and do so repeatedly without looking up answers. Trial by fire, brute force is the best way to get good at mathematics. 

The reason you were lucky in psychology is because it's probably one fourth of the difficulty of a math degree, not because of applied pedagogical insights.",comment,9

Just say you enjoy having a sense of superiority and let others lie. Having students brute force (especially independently) only works for those of us who are very self-directed learners.

I'm not saying practice is bad, but, practice (with an incoherent professor) only works for a select few. A lot of pedagogical research has been able to link student self-efficacy to success in topics of the students' interest, however, the rest of the success determining factors link to the instructor and educational environment (Prof. Bramsfeld's Authentic Learning Lab is literally doing research on this. I worked there.)

My girlfriend is in mechanical engineering and we sometimes tackle her homework together (and she helps proofread my reports, likewise. We're a team). I know the difficulty you guys are facing. The harder the course content, the \*more\* carefully you need to introduce the material so not to overload newcomers.

I say I'm in psychology, but I'm doing UTSC's double-degree program (BSc + BA) and I've covered a lot of courses, from biochem to stats to psych to english/poetry, others. I also did AP maths up until university, and it's similar to the first-year maths courses. My dad's a civil engineering professor with a doctorate + he makes me proofread his lesson plans since English isn't his first language. My opinion on this comes well informed from both my experience and what people who research and teach these courses say.

There are clear expectations, sure, but the process in which a professor isolates complex topics into structured units and then reforms these into a cohesive whole is really contingent on the \*professor,\* and this can make it or break it for some students. Not every country has the same education standard as Canada does, and several students and UofT are learning maths in a language they have passing familiarity with. Perhaps upper year seminars can be more choosy, however, for an introductory course, it should be about teaching.

As the top university in Canada, we can do better.

Lastly, I see you're getting dogpiled on by several other people. Maybe when you find yourself in a hole, stop digging?

P.S. look at [Prof. Lewandowska](https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2368901) (4.9 rating) who teaches stats at UTSC. Her course averages are routinely in the 50s-60s because stats is \*hard\* (I've taken both of them) but absolutely no one says that she's a bad professor. We can admit when we suck and it's \*not\* the professor's fault.",comment,9
