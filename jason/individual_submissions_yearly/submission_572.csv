Will taking 3 courses be much more of a breeze than 5? Would doing that make UofT more doable for someone that didn’t really study that much in HS & got good grades?

Is 3 courses too easy? Do I up it to 4??",submission,37

Generally that means 5 x 1 semester courses in the Fall and 5 x 1 semester courses in the Winter.

If UofT didn't think you were capable, they wouldn't have admitted you in the first place. Success also is not due to luck and is less a reflection of ability than it is of work ethic. If you want to do well, you need to put in the work. Otherwise you're just wasting time and money.",comment,8

It took a long time, but if you’re okay with that, I highly recommend taking a lower course load. Taking up to three full course equivalents (fce) in the school year plus one summer course was plenty for me (also stay at home dad), and allowed me the time to focus on the courses. (I said “up to three” because depending on what else was going on in my life I took 0, 1, or 2 courses. When I had two small children there was not enough time for even one, but when the younger was in school, I could start taking classes again). If you have nothing going on other than school, you could probably do four fce through the fall and winter, and one in summer, keeping on track to complete a degree in under five years. 

If you’re like me, you do well in classes you enjoy, and don’t do well in classes you find boring or uninteresting. At university you get to pick your program and select courses from within the program options. The great thing about that is that you can avoid courses you hate (unless they’re a program requirement, in which case, re-think your choice of program). 

When you’re picking your first year courses, look at the admission requirements for the programs you think you might be interested in. Start looking at program and course descriptions in the calendar now to get an idea of what your options are.",comment,2

I skipped a bunch of classes from AP transfer credits, and took 4 classes a semester for most of my time at uoft.

I personally did not find 5 courses too much in third year but in first year I did. So don’t shoot yourself in the foot by always taking less. You may be more capable than you think and if you don’t try you’ll never know. And if it’s too hard, that’s ok, you can drop.

But yes, 3/4 course is far easier. Depends on course difficulty though. 4 hard courses and one easy peasy one is kind of the same. 4 hard courses versus 5–bigger difference. 

3 course is very few and will take a while to get your degree so weigh that with your actual abilities, how well you want to do, and how long you want to stay in school before entering your profession. But remember taking extra time is okay if that’s what you need, don’t ever feel bad about it if you know that’s what you need and want. I know many people who took 6 years to finish a degree.

im in the same position as u bro, i also feel kinda dumb but im still going to uoft n gonna hope for the best

but from what i hear, most people take 4-6 courses per sem and i honestly feel like you'd be able to handle at least 4 ngl (but idk u personally or how smart u are at all but most people are able to handle 4, hell some people take even 6 and 5) 

so yes, 3 courses is gonna be easier than 5 but i personally think you'd be able to do 4. I'm personally doing 5 but i have 4 courses that are apart of my program, 1 bird course, and 1 co-op prep course (doesn't count as a course but its there) so 5 + 1 courses.

I would say, at least try a 4-5 course load before reverting to 3-4 (ie if you can tell it’s not working out, drop courses until it’s manageable). 

We can’t tell if it’ll be easy since it depends on the courses selected and more importantly, you. I’ve done 5/6 courses per semester so far in engineering and the only difficult portion is that you never have nothing to do. Exams happen every week for about 2-3 months straight — then you have finals. 

Obviously this isn’t going to be the same if you took 2-3 electives or birds, but you’ll find yourself having a lot more to do than taking only 3 courses. The worst thing is having too little to do imho, make sure you struggle a bit and always have something to be working on/doing but not too much to the point where you’re swamped and start  sacrificing academic performance. 

Also make sure you consider the fact you’ll have to end up taking summer courses/overloading later to obtain the credit requirements for graduation (this also means more $$ to pay for summer courses!).",comment,0
