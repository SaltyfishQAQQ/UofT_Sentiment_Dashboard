SOC100 grades for midterm and paper one? What’s happening ,imgrenade_,1gmxec3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gmxec3/soc100_grades_for_midterm_and_paper_one_whats/,1731111593.0,"I loved mcivor, and I understand that he’s sick but he can’t keep edging the students like this. Every day he says that he’s gonna do something by a particular deadline, and then he doesn’t do it. 

First he said grades will be released by Monday for the midterm. No update on Monday. Then he said on Wednesday that he will provide an update by Wednesday afternoon. No update on Wednesday at all. Then Thursday he says he will provide the paper one grades by Thursday night. Once again, no grades. He also says that he will provide midterm grades and paper two grades by Friday. So far, no grades. 

I comprehend that he’s unwell and likely experiencing significant distress, but I genuinely doubt that his teaching assistants aren’t the primary responsible parties for grading the essays and updating their grades. ALSO, if you can’t meet a deadline, and you know you’re sick, DONT COMMIT TO IT!!!!!!!! I would’ve totally understood if he said we will need another two weeks to get you your grades back, instead of promising to meet new deadlines and then not meeting them (REPEATEDLY). 

And one more thing, I don’t believe that teaching assistants can’t be compelled to perform this task for additional compensation (and if they can’t, that’s another issue with the system as a whole). ",submission,28

Messing around with turnaround deadlines is very frustrating. Better to be transparent and not keep students waiting once you’ve promised them a deadline.,comment,12

They haven’t been released “. 

He also said that “the average for the test was” and never said the average. This man is not real. 😂😂😂😂",comment,22

W the paper I don't rlly know what's going on there but hopefully we'll get it early nxt week👍.

I remember I  was told that our assignment would be posted before reading week…it was posted like a week after reading week. I was planing to work on it during reading week but obviously had no chance. 

Different course - professor replies in over a week (claiming originally it would be within 3 days)…like I don’t really need it a week and 2 days later cause it’s past your own deadline at this point.

And what I don’t understand the most - profs establish our expectations, why can’t they just come through or manage our expectations differently? I only expect to get a reply within 3 days because you said so, put as soon as possible instead  and nobody will be disappointed. I understand that life happens but still.",comment,2

The midterm was a scantron… and he told us the average weeks ago!! I love mcivor too but this isn’t fair to us, especially with the paper. At this point, if we get it back on Monday, we’ll only have a week and a half to do research and write a whole new essay if we have to do the third one (and no grace period). 

Also, I 100% with the TA thing. He’s mentioned that it’s the TAs who mark the essays, so his illness shouldn’t really be affecting this so much.",comment,4

Contracts are signed in September based on the collective agreement (Union's rules). You can't just ask TAs to do additional labour without changing the Description of Duties and Allocation of Hours (DDAH) Form for the course. It is not an issue, it is just how labour relations work.",comment,1

We aren’t a unique group of students. This is a large enough class for a general pattern to exist. And if filling ID number wrong is a regular problem, then it would’ve happened every year, and they should do something about it. There’s no reason for us to be an exception to basic human capabilities of filling in the student ID. 

And like you said, it doesn’t explain what’s going on with the papers.",comment,5
