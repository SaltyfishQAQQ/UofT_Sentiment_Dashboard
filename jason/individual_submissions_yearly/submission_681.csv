Students are increasingly taking more medications to beat out the innate desire of their souls for the righteousness and goodness of nature. He also predicted that as the industrial system becomes more restrictive, requiring less creativity from us, only AI will be able to answer our questions. Seems familiar to me...

Practically nothing about academia and industrial society is in alignment with nature. All the new architecture is fucking disgusting, disappointing, and bears none of the natural beauty reflected in the older UofT buildings. Architects used to look to form over function. They used to care about making buildings beautiful. But, this goes against immediate profits. Cities are the greatest culprit of this.

Also, the value of the degrees get increasingly more meaningless, and the jobs which they help you get, also get more meaningless. They produce no goods or services which give money its value. They merely create paper pushing jobs that do next to nothing. This is why in Canada, 1/4 of all jobs are government jobs: Jobs which manage goods and services, but they create nothing themselves. It puts strain on those who actually make things, while they want fair wages for producing nothing. Oftentimes, they want more than fair wages too. This is demonstrated in the Canadian economy today, where overspending has given us a deficit of 62 billion dollars, overshooting their low standard goal by 20 billion. As a result, those who actually do valuable work become more and more akin to slaves, working not just for themselves, but for their slave owners in government. Sound familiar?

Ted was a Harvard educated mathematician and economist. He got to Harvard at 16 years old. I personally don't think the answer is terrorism like He did, because there are societies which are more closely in alignment with nature, while still maintaining technological growth. However, It's increasingly disappointing to see them, alongside the rest of the world, stray towards rejecting and destroying nature.

tldr; Ted basically predicted everything going wrong in the world, and it all comes back to humanity not cooperating with nature. I encourage you to read his manifesto.",submission,27

If capitalism isn't something you are for history has passed you by. Its not about human emancipation but the emancipation of capital and the machines of production from us (we are the problem holding back modernity)

People like peterson belong in the dustbin of intellectual thought next to ayn rand (not related to my post just saw a reference to that hack)

At this point anything against the process of marketization is fascist. Marx was brilliant in seeing capitalisms liberatory potential, he just got what was being liberated wrong",comment,4

I was a kid when he was caught. His IQ was 167, Elon Musk level. Damn, you really don't want to study eh? lol The Unabomber is fascinating though. Can't believe he was caught because his brother recognized his writing style. There's a book called 'Bullshit Jobs', it's so true lol, I was part of it and made a small fortune. Tech is going to take us in a bad place, we're already seeing it. Look at the mental health problems in the younger generations, the loneliness epidemics etc, totally from rapid advancements in tech overwhelming our sociobiology. I'm old enough to have seen the transitions, from using Commodore 64s in elementary all the way to using ChatGPT.

I'm guessing you found the Unabomber through digging into Luigi Mangione while trying to avoid studying?",comment,-1

When people say “nature in its original form”, it SHOULD be quite apparent that we are talking about ecosystems and environments before mass human exploitation, no? As well, consider your point about “there is no cooperation with nature”, again, this clearly nitpicks what should be interpreted as “humans should find a way to coexist with nature”. I don’t disagree with your other points, but I think nitpicking semantics just weakens how well your position will be received.

""Nature, in its original form, does not exist."" In terms of absolutes, the garden of Eden would be nature in its original form imo. I'm saying we should look in the direction which approximates this perfectly beautiful form of nature, instead of actively turning away from it. From the biblical perspective, these ""artificial forces"" you mention, I consider to be the biting of the apple of the tree. This innate curiosity created our fallen nature. But, that doesn't mean we should abandon the pursuit of its beauty.

""A degree is an honour bestowed upon by the state."" And as the state willingly devalues and defaces more and more degrees, depending on the subject matter's malleability to creating bullshit jobs, they destroy what you worked to get. 

As an aside, one of the contributors to the devaluing of the degree comes from the rich having a highway to sending their stupid children to these universities. Intelligence is meritocratic, and wealth is not a 1:1 reflection of merit. So, by definition, rich people are devaluing the degree (international students). This is just one of many examples, and it doesn't even touch on ideological devaluing of the degree. (Which, again, the institution willingly allows and even promotes.)

""Management is a legitimate form of labour."" I agree. But, as the government has pridefully departed from acting as servants to the public, their ""management"" consists of the least efficient and greediest use of the money which workers make valuable. Of course, some management is necessary. But, I would say it's extreeeemely obvious that government is over managing and overpaying itself.

""Finally, there is no cooperation with nature."" I disagree with this the most. Nature is a harsh reality because we live in a fallen world. To pursue True nature, you remove the danger, and find a nature that's more closely approximating Eden by virtue of our human will; of our likeness to God's image. This is why Christians say in one of their most common prayers: ""...thy Will be done, on earth, as it is in heaven."" It is the hope that we can live according to what is absolutely Good, which is what I meant by nature. Of course, separation from the fallen nature is useful, but small villages essentially do that already. Like in Romania, for example. Very beautiful place.",comment,3

There's an issue with how nearly everyone with its power seems inclined to use it. The most advanced/moral we've gotten in terms of using technology in alignment with nature is when creating beautiful architecture, because beauty and perfected nature's will (really, God's will) are one and the same. I think this was the source of why the ancient egyptians found great success; their development of technology served a purpose that was beautiful, and it was for God (the pyramids), and it was for the greater Good (for making heaven on earth). 

However, short-term profits that come from offering ways of creating value out of thin air (which means stealing from someone else) via interest, gambling, profiting off of exploiting other's proclivity to sin: This is what makes more money, but less value in the short term. (As a side note, Jews are professionals at offering such opportunities, as they disproportionately own the means of usury, the porn industry, and other profiteering off of people via converting their environment into temptation.)

Every modern technological development today seems to be just for ourselves. Not only just ourselves, but to help others help only themselves, and help them only function alone via the path of least resistance: Life gets materially easier, and spiritually harder (not a property that's inherent to technology imo). By doing this, you create a Sodom and Gomorrah world where all you have access to is meaningless pursuits for meaningless money. Whether the system is communism or capitalism or socialism is almost besides the point: If the goods and services managed are not to help people be in alignment with what is absolutely and objectively Good, then that's where the dystopian lack of meaning is found, I think.

(Ngl still confused on how AI is stopping world war. I see it as delaying world war bc governments are just implicitly fighting by destroying their citizen's internet environments via propaganda and bots which sow division (russian bots during the US election, for example). This is much easier to do to make a peoples weak, which is just another form of attack. I'll read Benjamin's book at the end if it's related to this though 👍.)",comment,1

So I've researched him since then. I'm glad Luigi has stepped up too though, really good symbolism with the name for spreading the word with Nintendo's Luigi. Also just a seemingly really good character. 

I'm 90% sure now of just dropping out fully because for about a month, I've repeatedly sat in front of my desk to study, but have maybe done 2 hours in all that time. I feel completely disillusioned, and will probably try working 100 hour work weeks at some mundane, 20$/hr job because it would be more money and more meaningful than this torture. 

(And if you're a student reading this thinking I'm crazy, and you don't see how shit things are, just keep taking your meds and get that degree. You don't wanna risk being othered.)
