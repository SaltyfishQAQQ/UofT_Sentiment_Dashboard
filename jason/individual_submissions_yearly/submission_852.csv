Is it too late to contest a grade from a course taken in Winter 2024?,bloueeee,1dqp1mo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dqp1mo/is_it_too_late_to_contest_a_grade_from_a_course/,1719595237.0,"So basically the winter sem was terrible for me and I completely avoided checking any of my grades until june 20th or so because i was scared shitless to find out that i had failed multiple courses (not the most mature coping mechanism) - turns out the situation was not quite as disastrous as I thought, but I did fail one course (MAT136) with a 49%. I am incredibly embarrassed about it because I already took this course once and got a NCR, and then they made the course way easier and I STILL failed, largely because I didn’t manage to submit a huge chunk of coursework. I do kinda have some reasons for this and it was a problem across all my courses but I don’t have any medical documentation, and I’m concerned it’s pretty bizarre to ask for a 1% bump this late after the course ended, and I’m not sure whether profs even do that, but failing this course really messes up my degree plans. I guess it’s still worth a shot but idk I’m kinda hopeless :(",submission,19

I also had the documentation to show it. It's worth asking the professor, but they will likely ignore or deny your message, especially if you didn't submit your work.",comment,16

I realized grades on Quercus didn’t match the final grade I got on acorn. Prof fat fingered the grade and it was fixed,comment,8

So that would be around June 21st. Yes, it is too late.

  
You can still petition to change it through the math department. But you should have very good grounds for why you didn't contest the grades earlier and why your grade deserves to be bumped; these reasons do not include being too scared to check grades.",comment,3

Is it too late to contest a grade from a course taken in Winter 2024?,Unfair-Client3935,las3j0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dqp1mo/is_it_too_late_to_contest_a_grade_from_a_course/las3j0v/,1719630489.0,"Hey OP, that really sucks, I'm sorry! 

I've never contested a grade, but I did a very similar thing (I have a chronic illness that takes a lot out of me and during COVID my mental health took a dive (yay burn out!), turns out I've had anxiety for years and it just took over) I ended up failing a summer course and managed to get a late withdrawal, but I had to complete a lot of forms and statements, talks with accessibilities ect ect and I think what helped me the most was my long medical history. 

I would speak with the registrar and do a walk in appointment with one of the advisors, and start getting documentation/speaking with your family doctor or a mental health services so that you can prove to the registrar that you've been trying to work things out. You may need to just late withdraw this course and take it another time however, but I promise you, it's not the worst thing in the world and you will survive and graduate (I'm graduating this November!) The advisors can also help with any concerns you have regarding degree plans! 

Another tip for the next semester: Make an assignment spread sheet with due dates, course, extension allowances, extra info ect and share it with someone you trust that will keep you accountable and moving forward! It feels silly, but I started doing that and giving it to my mum and sister, and it has helped me so much when I am having trouble handing things in, and stops it BEFORE it becomes a major issue, and my grades have gotten better since I'm not able to procrastinate as much (my family are hardasses who love me lol) and my sister even helps me make schedules when I have a crazy week.

Good luck OP, and I hope this helps!",comment,2
