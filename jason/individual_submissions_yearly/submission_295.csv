She is at the verge of death and im absolutely terrified.  She was the  best grandma I've ever met. I don't know what to do, considering i have 3 projects due next week and i cant even focus on them. Update: as i was writing this, i have received info that my grandma is **dead**.  I am at a loss of words and will not update this anymore. I'll gladly read reply's and reply to them. r/UofT ",submission,90

UofT has a form that you can fill out to inform them of any extenuating circumstances that have affected your grades, and they'll take that into account in the admissions process. 

Additionally, as the other commenter suggested, talk to your teachers (or ask your parents to notify your school). They'll almost certainly be able to help and find a solution so that you can grieve without having to worry about schoolwork.",comment,30

This is definitely one of those times where your values and priorities become more clear.

I had to fly home about a week ago to bury a childhood friend who passed away unexpectedly. It's a strange experience to go through shock and grief while the demands of deadlines and responsibilities remain relentless.

Hit up your profs for concession and they might provide an SD to give you more time into January. Be gentle with yourself and double down on the basics: food, sleep, exercise + friends & family. It's alot to process but you got this. ‚ù§Ô∏è",comment,3

When my mom passed away it seriously messed up my schooling for a while. Talk to your teachers and make sure you take the time you need. It‚Äôs better than rushing back into things, operating at full tilt for a week or two, and then feeling absolutely wrecked. I made the mistake of trying to act like everything was normal‚Ä¶yeahhhhhh that didn‚Äôt exactly work.¬†

My condolences again, and let me know if you want to chat more.¬†",comment,1
