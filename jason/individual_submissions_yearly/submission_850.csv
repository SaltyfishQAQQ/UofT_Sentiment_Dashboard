You're going to get that message if you aren't enrolled in one major and two minors or the other things in the list you mentioned in your post.

Just enroll in anything random (two random minors for example) so that you can pick your classes. Then when you actually figure out which minor you wanna do, drop the random ones you picked and enroll in that. That's the advice my academic advisor gave me!",comment,2
