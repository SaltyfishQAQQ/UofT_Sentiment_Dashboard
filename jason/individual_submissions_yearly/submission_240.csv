Throughout first and second year I’ve had to retake numerous courses because I failed exams and even had a semester where I ended with a 2.0 sgpa. After changing how I studied, I’m proud to say that this year I’ve gotten all A’s. To anyone reading this struggling with their marks, I just wanted to say that I believe in you and it will get better <3",submission,116

Question…will this be ok for med school applications? Do they only look at last 2 yrs or all 4 cumulative?
Trying to decide UofT life vs Mac Life! 
Your post made me feel great about UofT but only if wouldn’t impact med school gpa!",comment,1

This made it better when completing assignments and studying for exams as I enjoyed the content and it didn’t feel like a huge chore. It’s not to say that I didn’t struggle because I definitely did in some courses this year but I went to office hours and asked more questions to better understand what I could do to improve which I believe definitely helped.",comment,13

As for med school, you have to check each individual school as they have different requirements because I know some look at all 4 and some will only look at your best 3 years. So it’s best if you double check!",comment,1

As for staying on top of things, I think it’s so important that you have a calendar. I used notion, and I made a calendar as well as a weekly and a daily list of everything I wanted to get done and organized based on importance. If I couldn’t finish a task one day I would put it on the top of the list the next day to ensure I complete everything. This helped me balance school, volunteering and also a few clubs that I was apart of!",comment,5

I also chose electives because I thought they were “bird” but they were in fact not easy at all.
