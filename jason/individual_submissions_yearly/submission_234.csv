I'm a 1st year grad student (24 yo he/him) from Japan at the UofT. It's really embarassing to say but my English is terrible even though I met the admission requirement for my program, and since I am really shy (like general Japanese), this prevents me from being open to others. I have some friends in my program, but when I see them in person, I tend to hesitate to speak as my group has become ""too big"" for me (though it's a nice thing!).

Another problem is that because of insane tuition, I can't socialize at all as I need to save money... Yeah it's very embarassing as well.

But, I just want to make friends with anyone because I just want somebody to talk with casually to enjoy culture together and just for me to have more opportunity to speak English to improve. I am extremely introverted so joining Japanese community is not an option for me.

It's a just a casual one. It's better just to meet somewhere around campus (St. george) and have a chat together if possible:)

I would be happy if you guys reach out to me!",submission,119

They hold weekly language exchange every Friday from 5 - 7 pm. Many Japanese join to learn English, and people who want to speak Japanese also participate. I am learning Japanese myself, and I used to join the club's activity from time to time. Don't be afraid to make mistakes and just be confident! I used to struggle a lot with English, since I've only started speaking English the moment I got here. It takes some time to get used to a new language. Anyways, feel free to contact me",comment,35

This won't help you with your English but the Japan Foundation at Yonge & Bloor has great activities and a nice lending library... [https://tr.jpf.go.jp/](https://tr.jpf.go.jp/)

Also you're eligible, as a student, for a Toronto Public Library card and that would allow you to get materials delivered to your local branch by putting a hold on them [https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37953+20281&Ns=p\_date\_acquired\_sort&Nso=1](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/search.jsp?N=37953+20281&Ns=p_date_acquired_sort&Nso=1)",comment,6
