Why Do We Need to Teach University Students About Personal Hygiene?,Acceptable_Train_487,1gy6egm,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gy6egm/why_do_we_need_to_teach_university_students_about/,1732386852.0,"Seriously, why is this even a thing? We're adults, not 2-year-olds.

I was studying at Gerstein Library when I suddenly caught a smellâ€”like something rotting. I looked around and realized it was coming from the guy sitting across from me.

I would feel so ashamed if I smelled bad. How do some people not care? I have long hair, and I still make time to wash it every single day. Do you not have time to shower? Is water not available in your home?

Don't make excuses. I'm in CS and Math, and I still manage.

In my experience, the people I've met who smell bad are usually guys with short hair. Let me break this down:

* **Short hair** takes way less time to wash and dry.
* **A shower and brushing your teeth** might take 30 minutes max.
* **Laundry?** Two hours a week tops, and most of that time is just waiting for the machine to finish.

Are you studying 23.5 hours a day that you can't spare 30 minutes for basic hygiene?  
Come on, people. Let's do better.",submission,176

There has been an email sent out to people in CS about the hygiene. 

Also, last night I went to one of the washrooms and every stall had piss and shit in the toilets. I thought not flushing was left in elementary school. I was so disgusted I just left without doing my business.",comment,20

During really busy exam seasons, once every two days is my absolute max. Most of my female friends donâ€™t seem to have hygiene issues either. Not to generalize, but from my experience, the concerns Iâ€™ve noticed have mostly been with guys.

That said, I hope everyone takes hygiene seriously! You donâ€™t have to shampoo your hair every single day, but please brush your teeth at least twice a dayâ€”after waking up and before bed. Itâ€™s not hardâ€¦
And for clothes, especially inner layers, please donâ€™t wear the same ones for an entire week. During summer, change daily. Even in winter, inner layers need regular washingâ€”donâ€™t wear them for a whole week (or longer!). Hygiene mattersâ€¦",comment,4

The academic pressure is just too high for many students especially in their first year because the gap between High School and UofT is too great of a leap and this causes a lot of mental distress that leads to bad hygiene practices. The pandemic also seems to have played a bit in this with many people being so used to being confined at home have started skipping many normal hygiene practices.",comment,18

But I also think itâ€™s not just depressionâ€”itâ€™s related to cultural background and family upbringing as well.  
I had a tough time during my first year. What I noticed was that even though I was feeling down, I still felt the need to shower or wash myself before going out. Itâ€™s kind of like a basic respect for yourself and for the people around you, a social norm.   
I think this might be tied to how I was raised, but in my culture, meeting people without showering or smelling bad is considered rude, or disrespectful to others. Itâ€™s about showing respect, both to yourself and to the people you interact with.",comment,6
