honey, my pookie bear. I have loved you
ever since I first laid eyes on you. The way
your architectural perfection strikes fear
into the other colleges’ eyes. From the cats eye, to that gorgeous
quad. I would do anything for you. I
wish it were possible to freeze time so I
would never have to leave you. 

You had a rough beginning, but you never gave up hope. You are even more amazing in Toronto than you ever were in Cobourg, sometimes I even call you home (I’m a commuter). I forvever dread and weep, thinking of the day I graduate. I would sacrifice my ownlife it were the only thing that could brighten the paint on your beautiful façade. 

You have given me so much joy, and heartbreak over the years. I remember when i first walked into northrup frye and couldn’t find the mcdonalds, its like my heart got broken into a million pieces. But a tear still fell frommy right eye when I woke up tied to a chair being force to listen to the old Ontario strand at full volume. Then allas, I realized i was in the mcdonalds and I rejoiced.

 I was crying, bawling even, and I heard my
glorious mentor exclaim these words,
""VIC LOVES DANIELS"" Not only
have you changed the world forever, but you've eternally
changed my world. And now you're getting
older, but still the goat, my goat. I love
you pookie bear, my glorious king, Victoria College.",submission,20
