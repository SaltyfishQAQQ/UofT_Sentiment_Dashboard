"I walked for 76 kilometers(and bussed 40 kilometers) from UofTSG to uWaterloo, with 2 strangers from the internet",Vegetable-Anybody112,1gtgvyc,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gtgvyc,1731859837.0,"This was quite the adventure. I walked to McMaster in October and posted that walk on this subreddit, I promised that I'd walk to uWaterloo, so here it is.

I made a post on here asking if anybody wanted to join in on the walk to uWaterloo, and two amazing people, complete internet strangers, responded to that post and we walked to Waterloo, for nearly 24 hours straight, together. As a group we were able to motivate each other by chatting, making jokes, setting reasonable expectations and goals, and overall I felt like this walk was more enjoyable than my solo walk to McMaster because of this company.

We met up at around 9:40AM. Initially, we had wanted to walk to Brampton and walk the 40 kilometers of highway connecting the GTA and Guelph. We arrived in Brampton at 8 PM (after 11 hours of walking) but decided not to walk this highway since it was dark, we weren’t sure if there were sufficinently large gravel shoulders to walk on, safety and time constraints. Instead we bussed from Brampton to Guelph University (at 10pm). After that we trudged on to Waterloo. 

We arrived at the outskirts of Guelph at 1:20AM and walked through a wide expanse of highway for 3 hours before arriving af Breslau at 4:30AM. We got to Kitchener at 5:00 and we arrived at Wilfrid Laurier University at 8:00. After an hour’s break to recover, we finally got to our destination of uWaterloo at 10:00. 

Unfortunately because of my lack of research I didn’t know that the bookstores in uGuelph, WLU and uWaterloo were all closed until about 10 hours into the walk, I really wanted to purchase some hoodies to commemorate
 this walk. ",submission,1597
