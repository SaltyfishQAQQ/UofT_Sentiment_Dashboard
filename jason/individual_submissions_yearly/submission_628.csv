I’m not sure if all of these places are open but I have some suggestions. Depending on your program there are main buildings like artsci is Sydney smith and engineering/comp sci Bahen and Myhal. But obviously you don’t have to be in those programs to go there. I’m in art sci and I like to go to Bahen or even the Athletic centre. Robarts is the main library you could visit, they also have a rare book collection open to the public that’s super cool. Honestly just walk around the campus like on St. George street and around Robarts there’s tons of buildings to study in and I’m sure you’ll have most of your classes around there. If you’re in a college like St Mikes, Victoria etc. you can visit that area too :) Don’t stress too much about finding study spots because honestly your routes will change once school starts and you’ll find places you like on your on time. I would say tho to go to Hart House as well, that’s my fav place to study and the building is super pretty :)",comment,3
