Get all your syllabi and pick out the date of every deliverable. Put them all in a spreadsheet. Course code, assignment, due date. Sort the sheet by due date. Now you can see what you need to prioritize. 

Take the details of every assignment and put them into a fresh doc for each assignment. Then you can start picking away as you‚Äôre reading or working through lectures. 

For readings: skim. If there‚Äôs an abstract, read that. There are too many to read all of them in depth. If you need a deeper answer, read more. Ctrl+F is your friend to find what you‚Äôre looking for. 

It‚Äôs hard. But you can do hard things.",comment,38

And you can be very housed without a degree.

  
I thought I was the only one thinking I'd be homeless if I didn't finish my stuff but even my well achieving friends were doing the same, it's a weird 20 year old belief thing.",comment,6

The opportunities you once had are gone, and the time you lost can never be reclaimed.
The person you could have become-the one with the skills, the knowledge, and the confidence-is now just a distant dream, someone you‚Äôll never meet because you didn‚Äôt put in the effort when it mattered most. And the worst part? You‚Äôll have to live with that regret forever.
