why doesnt the university of toronto have an optometry school,UJINYAY,1hf1sp1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hf1sp1/why_doesnt_the_university_of_toronto_have_an/,1734295213.0,"Iâ€™ve always wondered why uoft, being the largest and one of the most prestigious universities in Canada, doesnâ€™t have an optometry school. right now, thereâ€™s only one English-speaking optometry program in the entire country (at Waterloo) and one French-speaking program (at UniversitÃ© de MontrÃ©al).

considering the demand for optometrists in Canada (especially rural) and the fact that so many Canadians end up going to the U.S. for optometry school, it feels like thereâ€™s a huge gap here. UofT has schools for medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, and public healthâ€”so why not optometry?

Is it a funding issue? Lack of demand for another school? Or maybe itâ€™s just never been a priority for universities in Ontario? How would a project like this even start?

im just curious",submission,49
