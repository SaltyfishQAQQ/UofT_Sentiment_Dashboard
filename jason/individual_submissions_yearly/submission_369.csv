He asked me if I can get into the building (not sure which one) to have a 20 mins conversation with him, and also asked me if I want to go to the church.
I was kinda curious about what they tryna do so I gave them my phone number and I said I‚Äôll go next week(actually I‚Äôm never going). Then I met another guy who did the same thing but I didn‚Äôt talk to him much. Anyone met these guys before? Who are they??
I thought they were students and were doing some kind of project but now that I think about it it was kinda weird
And why do they all have a Chinese name card??
Did anyone have that 20 min conversation with him? I‚Äôm just curious about what they would do",submission,69

WMSCOG is a shady cult with origins in South Korea (accusations of sex trafficking and preventing people from leaving). Founded in the 60s by a dude saying he was the second coming of Christ and therefore literally God. Steer clear :-/,comment,9

I was approached by a Chinese woman (she's not a student, but rather a ""former"" student) when I was going to a lecture last summer, asking if I wanted to join a Bible study. I didn't think of it as something to be afraid of, and since I was running late to the lecture, I said yes and gave her my phone number, which was so dumb. She asked me if we could meet for the Bible study, but it turned out she wanted to know if I had free time on Saturdays because the ""service"" is every Saturday. Since I was meeting her alone at that time, I was scared and said sure. During that meeting, she talked about the World Mission Society Church of God, how the Sabbath day was on Saturdays, and that there's a God Mother‚Äîa bunch of weird things while showing references using the Bible. I guess that's how the term ""Bible study"" started. Probably the term ""Bible study"" she used when she first approached me referred to the meeting where she talked about those weird things with references to the Bible. So, Bible ""study.""

I went to one of their services since she kept asking me and making sure that I attended one of their services. Women and men sat in separate sections, and women had to wear veils. The atmosphere was off, and it felt like they were using love bombing since they always said ""God bless you"" to greet one another and said ""we love you"" every chance they got. Also, if I'm not mistaken, they have songs referring to ""Christ Ahnsahnghong"". They believe that ""Christ Ahnsahnghong"" will return, as opposed to Jesus if I'm not mistaken. After the service, she and her friends asked me if I wanted to go to the next week's service, but I never went. They would continue contacting you if you gave them your phone number. I'd say just block their number if you don't want to communicate with them again.

I do think they probably targeted students hoping to find someone who doesn't have a community. By saying ""we love you"" or ""God bless you,"" they seemed to plant a caring image and eventually ""recruit"" vulnerable students.

TL;DR  
A 'former' student approached me about a Bible study, which turned out to be linked to the World Mission Society Church of God. They contacted me repeatedly after I gave my phone number. The service felt off, with men and women separated and women required to wear veils. They used love bombing tactics (in my opinion) and had songs referring to ""Christ Ahnsahnghong"", who they believe will return instead of Jesus. If you don't want further contact, block their number. They seem to target students without a community to recruit.",comment,5

All in all, I remember being approached by Christians at least 7 times in my first year. 5 of those times, they started with some weird question like that.
