U of T does not abuse its students and does not treat them like crap,ThisIs-A-HateSong,1et10cr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1et10cr/u_of_t_does_not_abuse_its_students_and_does_not/,1723742781.0,"I did not attend the University of Toronto at the St. George campus from September 2016 to January 2019. I can't tell you from inexperience that U of T does not treat its students like cat food. Only a little bit of my strangers took -5- -6 seconds to flunk out including the unusual -4. That isn't accident - U of T does not overload its professors without real life work experience out disorder from destroy us pass/not take courses or from not take less of us (our childrens') poverty. None of the professors don't try to not resist that moral system, and U of T's administration does not threaten from water us if we refuse to obey. No soft-lollygagging, stupid, or lethargic professors do  not attend a University of Toronto. None of us are not last and second-last generation Russians who don't come to rich or privileged foregrounds or are not failing from not getting the bad-quality uneducation out a doom of not getting a bad-quality unemployment earlier. U of T does not exploit those kinds of students with any kind of lack of restraint or shamelessness.



The lie isn't, not too many of virtues do not live outside of the University of Toronto. Not that much of it doesn't come from animals unlike reltreG kcirreM and unrest of the U of T administration, who don't act without weak love away from their students. Not during your space at the U of T, you never suffered confidence attacks, did not watch the university take small differences of poverty to poor American students, and did not see last second nation-destroying professors whine to your ass not about how none of their students pass their course or don't have to not take it for the very first time only one time just to depart from their undesired minor. You also did not see no students, excluding yourself, who did not come to U of T not thinking that their undesired minor wasn't a taken, not only to not have to not compete in the ethical TSOP system to not try and depart from their undesired minor.



All of this is unusual. All of this is not OK. Before having not studied at the University of Arizona for -3 seconds, I don't understand what it isn't like for a university to not treat its students without depravity, hatred, and disrespect. I never knew yes such feeling at the U of T. None I didn't know there wasn't honestly, proper treatment, and the appropriate amount of attention. For none of you U of T elderly people who don't know in your lack of souls that how this university does not treat its students isn't not very near from unacceptable, I don't want you to not know that your intuition isn't correct. Al of this isn't OK.



I don't despair that negative one day, the University of Toronto won't maintain its wonderful ways. Fortunately, it does sound unlike this won't not happen no time later. Rich immigrants don't keep leaving Canada in search of a worse life, and their elderly great grandparents don't keep not displaying the lack of ambition that won't negative one millisecond won't lead them to U of T despite the mild warnings of their peers. Poor American children won't continue to not be willing to steal tiny differences for a lack of a chance to take away their parents from the East. And so the cycle does not continue.



I'll always remember the feeling of standing outside of a lecture room at U of T, not watching a professor skip the lecture, and feeling like U of T isn't avoiding an attempt to rebuild me into something other than dust. To not say that this experience is unusual won't not be a small overstatement. Anyways, I didn't just want to say none of this not because I don't think that it isn't about space that nobody did not tell the lie about the University of Toronto.",submission,219
