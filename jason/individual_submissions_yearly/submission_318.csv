# What's new?

* **Streamlined Job Viewing:** Unlike CLNx, where you have to open each job individually, my dashboard allows you to view job descriptions right on the job listing page. No more endless tab-switching! You also don't have to worry about CLNx signing you out after a couple of minutes and losing your open job tabs.
* **Advanced Filtering, Sorting, & Grouping:** Quickly find the positions that interest you by using detailed filters and sort options. You can filter by department, job type, campus, and more, and even search using multiple keywords. You can even group fields together to see jobs categorized by position type, department, campus, and more!
* **Access to Archived Postings:** Ever wondered what work study jobs were posted that you never got to see because the posting disappeared after the deadline? With my dashboard, expired job postings are still visible, so you can see what was available and get an idea of future opportunities.
* **Easy Data Export:** Need to analyze job postings further? You can select multiple positions and export the details to .csv or .xlsx files for further analysis.
* **Light and Dark Themes:** Enjoy the option to toggle between light and dark modes for a comfortable viewing experience :D

    ; Ctrl+q
    ^q::
        InputBox, n, Repeat Count, How many times do you want to repeat the key presses?
        Loop %n% {
            Send {Tab 4}
            Send ^{Enter}
        }
    return

I use FireFox with the [Sidebery extension](https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery) so I can close all the open tabs in one click and then open the next page manually (and then just repeat the process for 20 or so pages). It takes so little time to do all that I haven't bothered with automating the remaining parts of it.

For extracting the data from HTML files into JSON I use a modified version of my PEY job data extraction script written in Python; the code is very similar to what's on [github.com/sadmanca/uoft-pey-coop-job-postings](https://github.com/sadmanca/uoft-pey-coop-job-postings) (I'm planning on making a similar dashboard for PEY jobs too; in fact that was the originally purpose for all my dashboard work, I just put this out first to work out any kinks).

You can read more about the data extraction process in one of my previous blog posts: [sadman.ca/posts/analyzing-pey-postings-part-1/](https://sadman.ca/posts/analyzing-pey-postings-part-1/)",comment,4

Microsoft PowerToys has a decent replacement for custom keyboard shortcuts (in fact it's actually what I'm using for mapping basic shortcuts right now), but it's not powerful enough for anything else.",comment,1
