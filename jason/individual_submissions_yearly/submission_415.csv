LOST SENTIMENTAL KEYCHAIN if you find my keyblade keychain pls return,sskiharu,1gwrbej,https://i.redd.it/7ayhr62esb2e1.jpeg,1732225710.0,"yall i just lost an important keychain that my best friend got for me in japan. it means a lot to me so if you find it pls let me know.

it's a kingdom hearts keychain of the oblivion keyblade. it got cut off by a couple chain links so it looks exactly like the image without the clip

the last places it could have been when i lost it were in university college, athletic centre, or near con hall",submission,58
