I feel so hopeless and I’m genuinely so embarrassed and the imposter syndrome is taking over me. I was genuinely a really good student in high school I worked for my grades and I was so motivated. And I try here I really really do and now I’m feeling so so so hopeless. I don’t know how everyone’s able to take these midterms it’s like I go into the exam room and my mind blanks. I never get part marks and i really don’t know how to practice. For Lin alg especially I don’t know how to practice what I learned from the pces. Any advice please help me please please please I can’t afford to drop out either I really want to stick it out here. ",submission,74

I'm a TA for one of these courses and came to say don't lose hope! These courses are definitely tough and are rough for everyone coming into UofT for first year. Midterms are particularly rough considering you are still expected to continue with regular coursework, and these are your first set of midterms! My first-ever midterms weren't pretty either, but look where I am now! Good news is that all of your instructors and TAs know this, and are here for you. Review your tests, see what worked and what didn't and what some of your common errors were. Always review the solutions and see where you went wrong so you can try to identify some misunderstandings right off the bat. For the next tests, try to get a new study method. Usually for these classes, you want to be able to do all of the practice problems inside in and out with full understanding so you don't have to rely on memory and it will flood in naturally. If you are ever stuck, always come to office hours! Usually lectures are pretty short and sweet, and you usually will think you understand, until you get to some of those practice problems, which is why we encourage you all to come to office hours! My absolute biggest recommendation is just office hours though! We are here to help!",comment,17

Don’t let the stark contrast between highschool, and university progress hold you back because I did for me, and it just kept me in a toxic loop. The midterms in university are very different than any test in highschool. The best tips I could offer for you is now that you know how your professors mark, utilize that. Are they questions directly from the slides? Are they textbook questions? Find the source. Practice midterms are your best friend here, see if you can get them from a senior, or any published online or the ASSU. Also, going into the midterm, treat it like any other practise test, this is just another one. Put in your best effort, don’t overwhelm yourself. The best thing you can do is just stay calm as hard as that may be to do in the moment. A lot of the time people go blank because they’re so anxious. I promise you’ll get better w time, but for now, study each of ur classes and how the professor tests, so you can prepare better for any remaining assignments, and the final exam. Go to office hours! The professors are there to help, you can tell them exactly what challenges you the most, and they’ll help you out. The difference between university and high school is you gotta look out for you, no one’s there to push and motivate you. Do your best, and trust me, you’ll succeed. And have fun! Keep in contact with friends, it’s important to be taking breaks, because this process can be mentally taxing. Good luck!!",comment,8

I can't give any specific advice cuz I'm not in these classes but I strongly suggest talking to people in your classes that are doing well. Just chat about your situation and see if they have advices. These are the people whose position is the closest to yours so they'll understand what's happening the best.

I also suggest going to office hours to chat with professors. They would be willing to help you (that's why they're there), though they're far away from student days and the transition to university.",comment,5

my gpa still took a massive hit because the rest of my semester was also in tatters. cried about that too. it's really scary and confusing when you've done well your whole life to suddenly be barely afloat. but i promise you, first year is just ass for a lot of people. it'll ease up soon, and you'll get in the groove of things. i'm in 4th year now, and i've done way better and raised my gpa back up little by little. 
my advice is find a studying system that works for you, organise your life to take some strain off you (i love notion!) and do not be afraid to reach out for help. ever. accessibility services saved my life and entire degree. resources are available to you— tutoring, study groups, etc. use them if you need them. there's no shame in it <3 good luck!!!",comment,4

If it helps - drop a course even if it's late. Take it in the summer.  Once you get through first year and have that experience under your belt on how things work it will get easier.  It will still be hard but you can power through.  After first year you will also be on more of a level playing field with the folks who are generally doing better than you.  They are likely doing better because they had more preparation in a lot of cases (not all, some folks are just genius in academics).",comment,3

You did great in highschool, you got into engineering, so you’re probably not stupid. 
University courses are designed in a way that is quite the opposite of how highschool courses works. Lectures, unlike highschool classes, should be secondary sources of learning, while almost always your textbook should be where you get your content knowledge from. Lectures is used to enforce your understanding. Respectively, problem sets too are only a bare minimum to exercise to make sure you do practice. You have to learn actively from a variety of sources. 
Now on your comment of how you don’t know how to practice. The simple answer is to do the textbooks questions. If you textbook don’t have questions, find a textboom of the same subject with questions on the internet. I highly doubt you will be able to finish every question you can find. For linear algebra, you textbook will certainly have questions and if you run out, consider borrowing linear algebra problem book by halmos.
Subjects like thats of first year courses are nothing too difficult for anyone motivated. When you say dont know how to practice, have you really tried looking for how? Linear algebra is such a standardized course that there is absolutely no way you can’t find questions to do. Simple searching things like problems in linear algebra, problems in mathematical analysis, problems in mechanics will give you tons of sources to choose from. Go check gerstein collections of books in subjects of your interest, there are at least 20 books with distinct problems of the same content. Look on MIT OCW and they list all their problems set and solutions for their courses. There are too many sources to list.",comment,2

I would have to move a course to the summer, which would be in-person and cost an extra $1600 dollars. I'm still thinking about it, but I'm leaning towards biting the bullet and staying in CIV100.
