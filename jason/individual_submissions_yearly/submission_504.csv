Back then, the colleges played a much more important role than they do today.

Here's three high schools attended for the 4 colleges.

St. Michael's College (184 graduates):  St. Michael's College School (21), Loretto Abbey (16), De La Salle (9)

Trinity College (104 graduates):  Bishop Strachan (11), North Toronto CI and UCC (8 each), Havergal and UTS (6 each)

University College (249 graduates):  Forest Hill CI (24), Harbord CI (15), Vaughan Road CI (11)

Victoria College (227 graduates):  North Toronto CI (9), Lawrence Park CI (8), Humberside CI (7)

Interestingly, a significant number of St. Mike's grads seem to be American (about 15%).  About 8% were of Italian descent.  At Trinity, about a third attended Bishop Strachan, Havergal, UCC, UTS, Branksome Hall.  University College was about one quarter Jewish.  

Obviously there were very nonwhite students at the time, but there was a handful of students from the West Indies at U of T.

Waterloo and York had just opened a year earlier (and Glendon/York - then a college of U of T - wouldn't have had any graduates yet).,comment,2
