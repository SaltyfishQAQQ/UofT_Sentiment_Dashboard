Ofcourse in the event you do miss it you'll need to present a valid excuse (medical or otherwise, with proof) for why you couldn't make it so that you can sit the final at a later date. If you can't prove you physically couldn't make it then they would just take your final exam to be a 0 and calculate your grade accordingly",comment,17

It says â€˜Concerts and Examâ€™sâ€™. If itâ€™s checked you should have access to the reschedule entire class exam time. 
A couple of caveats, you need to be paid in full, and both your parents need to fill in the â€˜my child is super specialâ€™ form which you can get from your family photographer. 
-**Note** it has to be a concert on the list of approved concerts. As far as I know this list only has Taylor Swift and Kendrick Lamar on it. 
Good luck!",comment,19

Then my mother died, I lost the house we were living in, I had to then find a full time job and raise my teenage brother so that took precedence. But I still took my studies seriously and ensured I completed and graduated. Then my next priority in life was building my career.",comment,-3
