"Not a fan of my major, probably cannot switch, feeling lost in life",MarzipanClear3625,1g215xy,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g215xy/not_a_fan_of_my_major_probably_cannot_switch/,1728742859.0,"I'm in first year civil engineering and I'm not a big fan of my major. Usually all the things I think about when I think about engineering (math, software), are not nearly as crucial in civil engineering as in other disciplines. I was interested in structures, but looking at all the technical aspects, I'm not as interested in chemistry and geology as I am in physics, math and software. Heck, civil wasn't even my first choice, it was mechanical. It didn't help reading the salaries for PEY coop too. 

I wanted to switch disciplines, but I heard it's really hard since first year core 8s need an 80 average which I find incredibly difficult to achieve. Most of the priority goes to TrackOne, EngSci, and people above an 80 and though it makes sense, I just wish I could switch to something that interests me more. 

I constantly think about how I'm probably going to end up like those people who hate their degree and job and that was the type of life that I really wanted to avoid and I've been having a life crisis. Though school is not as terrible as I would have imagined so far, I still feel overwhelmed by the fact that I'm on a path that I do not like. 

TLDR: In civil eng, want to switch to ECE or Mechanical, probably cannot due to the high competition, feeling lost in life.

At this point, see if you can do anything to get into your desired major at U of T first (never hurts to check in with your registrar or any other offices related to transferring), then if not see about other schools. You can always transfer back to U of T with the credits you earned previously, though you may need to complete a bit more for the new program. If not, reorient and give yourself a while to think things through. The benefit of you staying in the program is lower than the cost of you doing something you'll probably hate.",comment,5

Ended up choosing Civ but was only interested in structural and figured I'd just grind out all the boring subjects). Ended up working in structural for my PEY and for a few years after graduating before realizing - this is boring and it sucks! Ended up applying for an Indy masters which I started recently. Definitely regret not switching into Indy earlier after 1st year!

**Talk to the 1st year office, see what they say**. Try your hardest this year and apply for the switch anyways, regardless of what chance you think there might be - it'll be 0 if you don't apply. I knew people who switched eng majors twice! (Materials -> ECE -> ... Materials lol). It is also easier to switch in 2nd year, but that would mean repeating more courses (still not as bad as a degree in something you don't want to do). And as others have said, look at other universities too, worth a shot.

In any case, talk to upper year ECEs/Mechs to see what their program is like and what their PEYs are like, and try your best to raise your GPA to allow for the switch, but from what I remember (this was 8 years ago), it was only difficult to switch into EngSci, and otherwise not nearly as hard to switch as you might believe as long as you're not on academic probation. Don't count yourself out!

Agree with minnie\_bee, something like half of my former classmates ended up staying in Civ a couple years after graduating vs moving into other fields.",comment,3

If there are spots for the non-guarantees, then they rank you based on your average. I'd focus on getting the best average you can. No point in worrying, just do what you can and you'll know if you can switch next summer.",comment,2

I think if you put your head down, study, work hard, you will definitely be able to achieve 80+ in both semesters. 

Keep at it and don’t listen to the noise around you about how it is impossible. Many people get 80+ both semesters in engineering. Check out the Deans honours list in the GB lobby, you will see it’s definitely not super rare with the number of names on that 4 page list. 

Midterms are just starting, you haven’t wrote anything super substantial yet so don’t believe you can’t do it before it’s even started :)

Good luck, I believe in you",comment,2

This led me to doing my MEng with the MIE department, but I made a case about it. I also did a voluntarily 4th year thesis on construction management and positioned that as something that would be relevant to the MIE dept. If you are interested in software engineering, pick up coding during summer time. Civ program is incredibly demanding, but if you can find the time join a club you’re interested in it will be great for your resume.

After graduation: I barely applied to any engineering jobs. I applied to banks, tech, consulting, and consumer packaged goods companies as associate or analyst. They don’t care that you studied civil. For example, I included my engineering degree on the resume but I excluded the discipline. When I was asked about it, I usually told a story about how as a young person my interests changed over time. 

My friend and I were actually talking about doing a workshop with the school discussing the very same question you ask. I saw a civ prof last week proposed to catch up with him. If you think something like this is interesting, let me know. I’m still active networking with the faculty.",comment,6
