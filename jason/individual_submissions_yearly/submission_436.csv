Potentially useful resources for students looking for research,saltypepperrrrr,1efy7qu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1efy7qu/potentially_useful_resources_for_students_looking/,1722357943.0,"Hi all - I'm a research assistant that has been lurking around here for a long while and i keep noticing people asking about research so I thought I might drop some resources that i found recently while hunting for new opportunities that might be useful for people, since the next year's approaching quick!



UofT Research Hub (https://undergraduateresearch.utoronto.ca/)

This is a new resource by UofT that I wish I had when I was applying to my first labs :( It has a big list of all the research opportunities available in and around campus. In my opinion, it has a lot of useful resources and is definitely worth checking out to get started or find new opportunities!



Undergraduate Research Students' Association - URSA (Instagram: @uoftursa)

Seems like a really big club for student researchers! They host a ton of big events (usually with free food - perfect for my broke ass) about how to find research opportunities and will give out some handouts and other resources they create from time to time. They have a podcast (with the man the myth the legend Prof Yip somehow??) and newsletter AND they also host lots of lab tours in both dry labs and wet labs, which I don't think any other clubs have(?). If youâ€™re at UTM, they also have a UTM branch of the lab and they do similar things but i personally donâ€™t know too much about them. their general membership sign up is currently open i believe!Â 



Mentorship with your program's Student Union (Instagram: e.g. @csbsu, @hmbsu @psauoft)

This varies from organization to organization but they generally have sign ups in September where you fill out an application and a few weeks later they match you with a mentor. Some of my friends really enjoyed the mentorship program and highly recommend it, but my mentor wasn't very helpful and i was stuck with them for the entire year :/Â  So, it's very hit or miss depending on who you get, but it's worth signing up for at least i think (especially if you want specific advice to your discipline)



Collective Undergraduate Research Experience - CURE (Instagram: @uoft.cure)

tbh I just stumbled across this one last week because they're a new club this year, but they have a huge list of events they want to run that sound promising. theyre trying to start a peer advising program for students looking to get 1-on-1 guidance about how to get into research drop-in style with whichever advisor of theirs you want. i took a look at their profile and it seems like their current list knows what theyre doing research-wise lol. They're also planning to have undergrad flash talks and have grad students come in to talk about grad school stuff



Feel free to add more that I'm missing, Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s a lot out there that I havenâ€™t noticed yet! (anyways back to lurking, peace)",submission,58
