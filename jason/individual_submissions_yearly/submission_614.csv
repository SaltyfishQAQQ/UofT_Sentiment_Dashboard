I probably just copy the slides down, but I can’t listen and copy the points the prof says at the same time.

Also, I’m not registered as an accessibility student, so I’m not sure I can ask for some volunteer notes.

So I’m just looking for a kind soul who is doing COG250 and PSY100 LEC0101, pretty/handsome please, if you make good notes, would you mind sharing them with me? I’ll even buy you a kinder if you want. 


Edit: Thank you, y’all are actually making me want to try harder with my notes. I guess I’ll take all these as tips to write notes in class.",submission,33

You might benefit from [meeting with a learning strategist](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task/meet-with-a-learning-strategist/), especially since this sounds like it's going to be an enduring problem across other courses. While I hope you get some notes, it's probably better to address the issue at the source. Appointments are free for registered students, and they can discuss some specific skills and strategies around your own existing habits and needs. (CLSS also has other tips throughout their [site resources, like here](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task_levels/centre-for-learning-strategy-support/)). You can also search this subreddit: there are quite a few posts of people asking for tips on how to take notes, and you can read all the comments there too. Lots of other resources exist, and I hope you can take a chance to use some of them! Good luck",comment,46

2. Write down the answers students give (ones approved by teacher)
3. Write points the teacher says and that arent present in the slides

You can do this with the slides 9/10 times depending on how your professor’s lecture style is. I don’t take a single note besides concepts I don’t really understand ( questions to ask professor in office hours ) in lecture I write my notes before/after and I just focus on what the professor is saying in class. If I need examples I get my own or I go to office hours and ask him to explain that specific concept again! Note taking is definitely a skill but if you’re not great at writing and listening like me I make it a point to listen during lecture, write and research concepts, main points during my own study time. Hope this helps !",comment,2

So you jot down stuff you find particularly important for the lecture, while making note annotations in the margin of your readings. 

I have severe ADHD C-PTSD comorbidity so I can struggle with note taking too since loud sudden sounds put me on edge a little bit. My advice is to get an iPad and some notetaking apps like Notion or Goodnotes 6. Goodnotes 6 is a freaking godsend since it lets me read my primary sources properly and can read it to me through text to speech as well as writing within pdfs so I can leave notes in the margins that I want to bring up in my next tutorial. Notion helps by organizing all your readings and notes within a database for ease of access. 

I hope this helped somewhat! Best of luck in your classes!!

A Classics Major, History Minor student.",comment,2
