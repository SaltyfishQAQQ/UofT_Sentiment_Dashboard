It's a tough market but it's not impossible, and from my experience most of the people I know are usually unemployed due to being too picky or by not doing 3+ co-op terms at different companies, which is the norm for most undergtaduates these days.",comment,16

Like it’s def v difficult to work for a top company but I’m sure most cs grads /interns would be able to find something at smaller/lesser known companies,comment,4

If you mean people who have a job having graduated with the CS degree its probably near 65%. Granted not all these students will be working exactly in the role they wanted or at a pay they wanted. 

Usually graduates get jobs. But time is the question, you likely won't be getting a job right away but with a couple months of applying maybe you'll get a hit if you have a stellar resume with prior internship experience (which is basically mandated nowadays). 

Also, looking at these statistics really won't do you much help. If you're trying to gauge whether or not you will get a job, this will give basically no insight. If you want any takeaway, simply just realize that there are jobs out there for a CS degree but there is no way in hell that quantity is going to catch up to the number of graduates looking for a CS job. Thats reality for a lot of majors. So you really need to stand out.

Don't let this stress ya out. If you have a passion, and are willing to commit. Theres a 100% chance you end up with a job.",comment,1

So it will be interesting to ask this same question after a year or two for 25/26 grads.",comment,12

It's shockingly very low cost for the employer to hire, and it's only for 4 months. It's typically why when most big companies conduct layoffs, internships are very rarely impacted.

Again just don't be picky. IT/QA/Analyst roles are good starters if you can't find any open SWE internships. Send a minimum of 400 applications per semester, and most of all do NOT rely on the co-op job board! ASIP rarely has any exclusive postings so it's the same as applying via LinkedIn, which you should do too! Look around your connections, see where they're working at. Sometimes companies only just post on their careers page which reduces the competition 10 fold.",comment,4

Here's a list of some of the Canadian universities that offers at least 3 co-op terms in their CS program:

Waterloo, UTSC, York, TMU, Guelph, WLU, McMaster, UBC (UBCV + UBCO), SFU, uOttawa, Carleton, Alberta, Calgary...

Only a minority of universities/campuses do not offer them, and I find that the most successful students at these schools follows a similar schedule, with the difference of only being able to apply to external job postings.",comment,1
