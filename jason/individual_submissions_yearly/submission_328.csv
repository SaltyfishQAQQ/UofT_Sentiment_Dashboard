Haven't had any classes with them this semester. Managed to reconnect with one this semester in the hallway a couple of times as our classes were close to each other. I am, however, now coming on about year since seeing/speaking with at least one of them, and another which I haven't spoken to in up to two years now. In past years we might have passed each other walking around on campus and said hi, but that's gotten more rare now. Mostly my fault for spending most of my day in the more quiet, isolated parts of campus for studying, but even then you would think at least once during a semester we would run into each other.",comment,3
