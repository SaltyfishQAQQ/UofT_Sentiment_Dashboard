 * Nautical context, when it means to paint a surface, or to cover with something like tar or resin in order to make it waterproof or corrosion-resistant. *The deck is yet to be payed.*

no one is hateful, i merely pointed out that the protesters need to be kicked out and leave. they need to go protest somewhere where it actually makes a difference and somewhere where there are actually people that are involved and connected with the war going on and can make a difference. 

the concern of protesting and blocking a place that is not involved in the war is that these protesters can chose to protest anywhere and maybe chose to protest a more impactful place such as train stations to try to disrupt and prevent people commuting or hospitals and try to prevent people from getting healthcare. this is a big danger and the ontario gov and uoft need to make sure this does not become a precedent to allow for other things. take action and kick them out.",comment,1
