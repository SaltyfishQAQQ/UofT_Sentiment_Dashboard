Literally. But he doesn't want a girlfriend that's too fat, too skinny, no ass, no attitude, cooks and cleans his DORm(???!!) for him, and takes him out to buy food. Btw, I am a girl and ts (not even the criteria but the ENTITLEMENT) pisses me OFFF SOO MUCH.

It's gotten to the point where he will find me while I'm eating lunch/dinner and right when I'm about to pay he'll bring his food too and say we're paying TOGETHER and ask ME to pay. I'm not even rich like DAMN like this dude is international and hella $$$ and he thinks 25 bucks isn't that much but bro 3x a week like bruh. It's not that I want to pay, but when I don't, he's genuinely an asshole (pushes me down a few stairs, trips or bumps into me, embarrasses me in public, and even one time it was so bad because I was calling my family back at home, who are VERY conservative, and he was making sex noises while I told them I was studying at Robarts).

Literally every interaction I have with him I dread. Even the future ones

There's no way to get rid of him either since same classes and A LOT of mutuals",submission,334

Bruh are you in high school or what. You just met him this week and you can't get rid of him? I wouldn't call someone I barely know a friend either. 

Don't be a doormat. Say no when he asks you to pay for something. In fact, just leave when he comes around. Tens of thousands of people go to UofT, there are better people out there you can meet and be friends with.",comment,333

You can try to state in a calm manner that him constantly talking about wanting a girlfriend makes you uncomfortable. As well as you not wanting to pay together. Both of these things are pretty reasonable demands. If a friend isn't willing to respect that, it isn't really worthwhile. 


Also while you may have mutuals as long as you separate in a way that's clean, it doesn't necessarily have to bleed over into your other relationships. 


Ultimately, I would recommend confrontation and voicing the things that are making you uncomfortable. Because the behaviour will only continue to get worse if you do not voice your needs. If confrontation doesn't work, cutting him off would be preferable as that continual stress will build up over time. ",comment,41

1. Go to classes a bit late so that you know where he sits. Then pick a seat that's not near him.

I had no idea how dysfunctional I was until I started living among my peers. Not every home is a happy one and we bring some pretty nasty coping mechanisms with us to University. I hope your friend gets good help. The opinions he espouses means he's compensating for a much bigger problem. It isn't your job to fix him. There are plenty of really interesting people to meet in University. The longest lasting contacts were people outside my own field that I met socially.

The guy behaves like an 11 year old.

If he tries to pay together for lunch again, say something like ""Bruh, I'm broke. Can you just pay for yourself?"" If he starts jabbering about needing a GF during class say something like ""Ssssh, I'm trying to hear what the prof is saying."" If you can, go to class a bit later than him and sit away from him. Maybe avoid hanging out with him outside class/tutorials as much as possible.

Depending on how you handle it, you can still maintain some level of amicable relationship with him if you want. I know you want to avoid making things awkward with your mutual friends, but most reasonable people would understand that he's out of line.

If he refuses to leave you alone, then you will need to be more direct with your approach. It will need a more serious conversation.

You don't need to explain this to anyone else, but if you are in a position where you need to or believe it would help with your situation, I think most people would take your side based on what you said.

I would straight up never pay for someone else’s food like that. They are practically a stranger leeching. And also $100/week is not cheap…That’s basically another couple days worth of food. 

You’ll notice you run into people like this often during your stay here at UofT. All for different reasons, maybe they want your answers, or your company or your money or whatever. You cannot just let them do as they wish. And yeah, talking to a girl about wanting to get laid and all these expectations is the last thing any sensible individual can do.

Thank you for sharing this, it's really brave of you and I am glad you reached out for support ♥️

I think it's important to document this type of behaviour and confirm that his behaviour is not ok.
I also understand how it can be easier said than done when a narcissistic person is focusing their uncomfortable spotlight on you, to kick them to the curb. It's actually a little frightening how they display their ""claws"" in you and their possessive manipulating behaviour when you try to deviate from their plan. ( aka them embarrassing you when you don't pay for their shit). So rude!

Mom mode here - (and as someone who is going to uni in my 30's)

Just want to tell you - there is always something you can do about it. Even if it seems scary. 
I think it's important to at least get another friend involved or if you really need to find an authority in the dorm, school, or even the cops if you really need to. 

Something my mom always said to me was ""you teach people how to treat you"", now that you are aware that this behaviour is not working for you - if you continue to let it happen - you are casting votes for him to take up space in your life. 

And ""if you can't change your people, change your people"" ( aka if you can't change what's going on, change who you hang with).

Don't let this manipulative jerk sink his claws in you, I've been there and also watched too many of my friends get divorced from creeps like this and it's so messy and they are a shell of a human when those creeps have finished raking them over the coals.

There were many great suggestions in the comments - as uncomfortable as it is, just say no, I am not paying for this ( the broke comment seems like it would work!) or, even turn the spot light on him, and be like ""thanks for getting it this time,"" and make him pay for it!""

He is wanting control, and wanting a reaction out of you...dont give him the satisfaction, don't let him groom you. Narcissistic people are actually quite insecure and thrive on control and attention. If you google ""how to get rid of a narcissistic friend"" there are a lot of great suggestions as well. 

So the least ""confronting"" way to try to get rid of him is just pretent to be super boring and uninterested in him, and don't give him any emotional reaction, don't give him any opportunities to connect or control the spotlight. If that doesn't work, you may have to step it up and set some hard boundaries.

A rrrrrreeeeeeeaaaaaaallllllyyyyyy good book is:
UNBOUND BY KASIA URBANIAK.

This chick is the bomb and heavily influenced the path I am taking for my psyc degree. She was a dominatrix and she has boundaries like a mo fo. And teaches you how to too! The audio is great. She reads it, highly recommend!

Sending you all the love and strength to lose this jerk. You are worth more and deserve better. Don't let him pull you down to his level of shit. I hope this helps! 

Ps if you need someone to report him anonymously, send me the deets and I'll do it for you!

Do not sit with him, if he sits with you politely excuse yourself to leave (also don’t tell him where you’re going), block on all social media, refuse to engage in conversations longer than needed, ignore him in group settings. 

If he continues to pursue, and there’s no way to escape him, set a hard boundary. Tell him you do not like being his friend because he is not respectful of you or women and you will not engage in any interaction because he is NOT a good friend or person. Tell him that if he continues bothering you, or if he hits, trips or pushes you again, you WILL file a report to the police against him for harassment and assault.

It's funny until someone gets hurt. We have a lot of mutual friends, and I don't mind hanging out with you and them moving forward, but I need you to tone down these interactions.""  

Make sure to tell a tight lipped individual what has been happening and if they notice it. Tell them you are confronting this guy.

In the off chance it isn’t: ghosting simply isn’t enough. U have to get to class earlier than him. Sit somewhere totally different every class. Maybe near the prof? Leave early or arrive late maybe.
