"Sharing my story, idk if this belongs here but worth a shot",Glittering_Growth532,1d7v9ks,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1d7v9ks/sharing_my_story_idk_if_this_belongs_here_but/,1717502045.0,"I‚Äôd (F23) like to share my story. During CoVID, I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes. I struggled with the diagnosis, facing medical bills, learning how to manage injections, and dealing with changes in my body weight. I began self-medicating with weed oils, which led to an onset of psychosis. Feeling vulnerable and sheltered, I wanted to step out of my bubble as well. Oils sorta just made me detached from reality. 

I met someone, let‚Äôs call him Smelly Walrus (both 22 at the time), through a U of T party house. One night, I got drunk and shared my trauma with him, including my struggles with diabetes. Instead of offering support, Smelly Walrus preyed on my vulnerability. Despite my severe untreated condition, he took advantage of my social struggles. Telling me I was getting better with him when in fact it spiralled my addiction like crazy. He was also controlling to a point if I‚Äôd give someone attention he didn‚Äôt like he would give me shi‚Äô for it. Just an insanely evil intent person. 

This man, an insecure narcissist, knew my buttons and used them against me. After being discharged from a psychiatric ward following an overdose, I found myself being verbally abused by him. He would yell at me and brag to others about forgetting my name, making my drug use worse instead of helping me as he claimed. His close friend even sexually harassed me, and they blamed me for trusting people. When I cut ties with them, they sent a list tearing me apart, accusing me of acting like a victim.

I'm a people pleaser, so I thanked them for their input. The stress caused me to start hallucinating, and my mother aged a decade from the worry. Eventually, I filed a sexual harassment report, and Smelly Walrus' friend faced consequences.

These individuals prided themselves on being ""woke,"" but their actions stemmed from feelings of being society's underdogs. They resented me, knowing I was unwell and naive and ig had pretty privilege, which is no provide when you‚Äôre just being used. Their behavior left me with severe PTSD, requiring three different medications, including one cholesterol medication known for for reducing nightmares and it still did not stop. One of their female friends, whom I helped at the gym, was a complete pick me snake, spreading rumors that I caused her body dysmorphia. She mentioned she was insecure about her face and i told her how every country has different beauty standards and heck her face is my ethnic countries beauty standard and she blushed and said thank you. Went behind my back and told others that i started pointing and bringing up her face shape. How she couldn‚Äôt leave the house cuz of the body dysmorphia I gave her. this women is nuts. I still apologized after the bullet point list she made with smelly walrus telling people that my concern about the sexual harassment was overblown and i‚Äôm being dramatic. 

I was surrounded by people who took advantage of my vulnerable state. However, I've since sought professional help, started Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to cope with my PTSD, and am slowly but surely bouncing back. There's a lot more to the story, but this gives an idea of what I endured.

UPDATE!!

THANK YOU so much for the support; I didn't expect anything from this post. I deleted the app shortly after posting and redownloaded it today. This is crazy y‚Äôall. I didn't bother reading Smelly Walrus's comment‚Äî this man even replied, LMFAOOO you see the pettiness I dealt with that just exudes off this man imagine being literally mentally and physically disabled (diabetes and psychosis) and have that energy around you. He knows he's smelly üò≠. But to end off  my psychotherapist sent me this:

* Others used me (what i‚Äôve said and discussed in our sessions): and I did not have the ability to defend myself against their effective manipulation: It is not my ‚Äòfault‚Äô for ‚Äòallowing‚Äù it to happen: I didn‚Äôt have the capacity to defend myself, and recognize the signs (therapist written response) 

ILY guys we only going up from here! Also to highlight I‚Äôve never been in such a horrid mental state than the 4 months I was around him. I‚Äôm light years better than that state and many opportunities have come my way that I‚Äôm very fortunate for including jobs, relationships, fitness, etc. ",submission,67

Isn't it crazy that no one from that time is on your side? Like I was the only one that was trying to help you when everyone else said you were a shitty person? 


Underdogs of society my ass, the rest of us are graduating from school while you're doing drugs. Take some fucking responsibility. The rest of us actually have hobbies and friends. We work, we have fun. Even when you talk about other friends, you're always shitting on them too, so I'm not surprised.


What advantage could I get from you? Having a liability every time I go out? Getting my friends mad I brought you along? Needing to care for you cuz you would always drink and do drugs when I always told you to chill and not do as much? Having to stay out in the cold cuz you didn't wanna go home, and I felt bad for you and didn't wanna abandon you? 


You're always talking about pretty privilege. You're not that pretty. Instead you're always subtly shitting on everyone else because the only thing you feel good about is being 'pretty'. 


Drug use worse? I literally told you to do less, but you wouldn't. You would literally cry and yell if I didn't let you smoke. You would always do too much, and me and my friends have to care for you.


Also we were not accusing you of being a victim. We accused you of being a shitty person that tries to make it seem like it's everyone else's fault other than your own. I understand bad things happened to you, and that why I gave you so much leeway. But in the end you harm everyone around you.

Edit: I'm not sure if this is relevant, but most of my friends aren't guys. The people hating on her were mostly women. it's also kinda fucked to call my friend who actually has good relationships with women a 'pick me'. Especially since you struggle to make female friends yourself as they generally quickly figure out you're a bad person.",comment,-2

If I could, I'd have so many people from my past who would defend me against his claims. SO MANY PEOPLE from my life have nothing but kind things to say. I know who I am morally and I know that this is merely just a rough chapter in my life that i‚Äôll bounce back even stronger from. I INTENTIONALLY kept him and his degenerate friends away from my old friends. I even felt bad for his childhood best friends and asked him to check on them because they seemed so poorly treated. Not everyone has time to party constantly; people have lives. Most of my previous friends were STEM majors or nice, reserved Muslim girls who have since graduated.

On campus, I‚Äôd avoid people from my past out of embarrassment about my situation. I also felt protective. I was sheltered, so many of the people I knew were from a reserved bubble. My first year on campus, I had a large group of kind, normal friends, but at the time, I took socialization for granted and didn‚Äôt appreciate it, which I regret in hindsight and I know a lot of us do post covid. My socials were all private, with less than 100 followers, and people would say I was super secretive and private. I was an extremely reserved person before my later struggles with diabetes, addiction, and psychosis.

*** I feel horrid knowing he uses this line of manipulation on others who are less fortunate in terms of social skills. Digging on people‚Äôs insecurities of socialization and we all have had a hit post covid. He ended a friend group because they didn't know how to get to the library, calling them losers. When I exclaimed, ""Damn, you dipped on your friends,"" he responded, ""No, they had no skills, no friends, zero."" I really just felt bad for them. This man‚Äôs a straight psychological abuser.

 My brothers, childhood best friends, mom, etc., warned me about smelly walrus saying he seems shady, but I was so brainwashed that I insisted he was a good friend. 

cuz if you think about it, everyone is so different and their world and perception is so different so when someone‚Äôs coming at you with negativity, it‚Äôs about them and their world and their world is shaped by their inner feelings

I was a loser hanging out with him‚Äîlosers attract losers. It's frustrating that I allowed someone so beneath me into my life cuz i was HAVING SEVERE PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS‚Ä¶ I even told him many times that I wouldn't normally hang out with people like him.

He sent me bullet points while I was in camh, suffering from severe psychosis and bipolar, ONLY after I blocked him because he still chose to be around my other abuser but it was constant cycle of abuse and that was the straw. Looking back, many of his male friends were shady and made me uncomfortable by hitting on me etc. For instance, his childhood best friend, whom I met once, sent me a picture of gifts he bought for me from Japan, which weirded me out, so I stopped replying. At a party I met him, this childhood friend kept trying to hold my hand and touch me. I wanted to confront ""Smelly Walrus"" about it, but before I even got the chance, he deflected by mentioning two guys he brought to the party, one of whom asked a girl an inappropriate question ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your body count‚Äù he aggressively excused it by saying the guy was drunk and not used to being around women, so I dropped it, as I did with most things and oh boy was there MANY MANY things. Narcissist first go to emotion is anger. 

What's frustrating is that the friend who made me uncomfortable was someone I felt sympathy for and thought needed support. I even told ""Smelly Walrus"" to help his friend out, without mentioning how uncomfortable he made me.

 I was legitimately very ill and smelly walrus is someone i‚Äôd never socialize with if I was well and i even was like I wouldn‚Äôt have hung out with people like you before lmfao.. I‚Äôve been pretty reserved with who i let in my life i was just in a bad spot. and before I met him i spazzed in my lab and a girl told me i needed to check myself into a hospital but at the time my family wasn‚Äôt educated on mental health and i was a pretty helpless reck. after that horrid list they sent me my mom was with me, and I started hallucinating, breaking out into a manic episode 2 days after i still have trouble sleeping because of the intrusive thoughts. My mom‚Äôs health has deteriorated just dealing with my horrid mental health during and after:( Like i was so traumatized that my brother would speak to me and i wouldn‚Äôt even realize he was talking i went blank. PTSD often involves avoidance and fragmented memories, so I only remember bits and pieces of that dark time (therapy is helping me remember). After blocking him, I couldn't even sit without severe pain for weeks. My psychotherapist explained that my body had been tense while I was with him, and after blocking him, my body felt safe and relaxed, but it left me aching terribly. 
 
But in therapy I‚Äôm finding closure in this cuz;

smelly walrus didn‚Äôt get enough love most likely growing up. i feel closure in that in the sense of moving on n forgiving. kids are innocent, adults r corrupt. i gave him loads of love despite the outcome. 

now it‚Äôs just a lesson, moving forward.",comment,3
