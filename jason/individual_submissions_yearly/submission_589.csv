I mean there are entry points such as insurance or bank teller I am familiar with. Also new grad trainee programs. 

However, they are quite scarce. Wondering how did you pave your way? 

For me, I couldn't do much with BA in econ so went back to accounting. ",submission,38

I feel so alone.... It seems like all my classmates are well off and I am only unemployed. 

Also 4 internships is insane, I remember 2 years ago everyone said tech was booming and if you know how to code in python your some golden candidate.

I‚Äôm not out of school yet. In fact I‚Äôm considering dragging it out a little to avoid a career gap. Idk if it‚Äôs a good idea but it could let me do yet another internship to maybe boost the resume further.",comment,3
