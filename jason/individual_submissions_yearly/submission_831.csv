advice for HMB265 final for future years (took it in 2024 fall),xoworriedstudent,1h85etn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h85etn/advice_for_hmb265_final_for_future_years_took_it/,1733502864.0,"just finished the HMB final! it wasn't as bad as most people of reddit say it is. 

**overall points:**

* more memorization focused compared to the midterm
   * whereas the midterm is entirely focused on content in the first half of the course based on calculations for pedigrees and diseases, the final is more of a broad approach 
* not exactly cumulative
   * imo there were more questions from the second half of the course
* second half content includes minute details

**advice for studying**

* if you're behind, survey / read the practice paper before you start studying so you can gauge what kind of questions will be asked and study for those kinds of questions
   * I wish I did this so I would know that the final would be more memorization based :(
* note down inheritance ratios for all the mentioned diseases and conditions and which generation they apply to (ex. epistasis (4|5 kinds), X linked etc)
* complete big picture understanding before focusing on details from second half of the course
* memorize probability rules and understand how to use them in pedigree situations
   * most of the time: to find P(outcome)
      * look at the conditions required for specific outcome and how to achieve these conditions
      * evaluate the probability of these conditions occurring
   * ex. P(child affected) with dominant inheritance for disease A
      * conditions: child must be AA or Aa to be affected
      * probability of each condition occurring
