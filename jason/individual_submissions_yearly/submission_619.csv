I just finished all of my midterms for the semester and now finals are coming up in 3 weeks and Iâ€™m severely underprepared. I canâ€™t even bring myself to study for them BECAUDE I JUST WANT A FUCKING BREAK. Iâ€™ve been having midterms after midterms since the end of sept. Canâ€™t I just rest. I just want to have fun and go out w my friends but that comes at the expense of my grades so idek I wish life was just about having fun and living it to the fullest but no we spend most of it behind computer screens and tests.,submission,32

Iâ€™m coming back on the 13th of jan because that was the cheapest flight i could find. You could also do something similar. I know tickets are really expensive, mine were too since iâ€™m from pakistan which is far. I wasnâ€™t even planning on going home for the winters until two weeks ago. Maybe theres a workaround to get cheaper tickets. I hope it works out for youðŸ¥²",comment,1
