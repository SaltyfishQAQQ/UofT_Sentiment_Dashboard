Will I be able to make friends when i took a gap year?,ohjeenguh,1e8494p,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1e8494p/will_i_be_able_to_make_friends_when_i_took_a_gap/,1721505719.0,"Im 05 but im starting my first year in uoft. I took a gap year right after I graduated and im from vancouver bc. I dont know anyone in uoft and im anxious about making friends.
Its my first time out of moving out alone and Im kind of introverted.
but i want to make other 05 friends but most of them would be in second year now. And if i do meet other 05’s i feel like they would already have settled in a friend group. I want to make other first year friends too but im more comfortable with my own year sometimes. 
Will i still be able to make friends in 2005 when im starting in first year?

+ thank you everyone for your comments! It really helped me to worry less and not be concerned about it :)",submission,16

1. there will still be people your age in first year. other people also took gap years, some people are from other countries where the grade system is different (i made friends with an american girl who was my age in my year even tho she didnt take a gap year, they just calculated age+grade differently in the us)

2. a big change in university is that peoples ages dont matter that much anymore. almost all of my new uni friends are 1-2 years younger than me. i was shocked when one of them told me she was 2 years younger than me but once youre over 18 you barely notice it. there will also be people in your year who are older than you, mid 20s and above, and you might not even realize unless you ask for their age. the thing that unites most friends is what year theyre in, not their age, since everyone is different ages because u of t is such an international uni + mature students. 

3. in your first year, you will still encounter second years. many upper year students take first year courses for various reasons (i took arh100 as a 3rd year because i started a new minor late). you are also allowed to take some 2nd year courses as a first year (just check on acorn). this will be great for meeting other second years. 

4. you will make friends with whoever you are living with or live around. again, if theyre your age great. if not you will barely realize

hope this helps :)",comment,16

I'm pretty sure in Canada we graduate a year earlier than most other countries, so in fact lots of international students in your classes would be 05 as well, but again it doesn't matter. I've hung around people that are 2 years younger than me as well as 6 years older (they were in undergrad), so its not a factor at all, this isn't high school.",comment,11

Though, I wouldn't count on finding only people in 05. It's easier to branch out and just make friends based on the person rather than their year :) From experience, it's actually easier to make first year friends (that don't just become acquaintances) since they don't have established friend groups already, but it's up to you! Just be friendly and trade socials, and try your best to connect with 1-2 people in the lectures",comment,5

Especially considering you are an adult now. The difference between 05 and 06 necessarily becomes smaller when you exist high school.

For the record, I was also born in 05 and took a gap year to attend U of T starting this year. I actually almost went to UBC funnily enough.",comment,2

Especially not for a one year difference. The friends I've made both through UofT as well as my previous program at Seneca were all over the place in age. What mattered most was shared interests, shared experience (which comes naturally by taking classes together/being in the same year of university) and just generally enjoying each other's company. Being the same age plays a bigger role in your social life in high school because you're all sorta experiencing the same stage of your life at the same time as each other, but the lines get blurred in college or university with people switching majors/being in the same clubs as you/being in the same electives as you/having the same part time job as you (if you end up working)/taking gap years/starting later in life etc etc etc. With that being said, even if you are more comfortable with people the same age as you, you're also absolutely not the only person who took a gap year, nor will you be the only person from 05 in the classes you're in. 

tldr you'll be fine, and I hope you enjoy your time at UofT",comment,2
