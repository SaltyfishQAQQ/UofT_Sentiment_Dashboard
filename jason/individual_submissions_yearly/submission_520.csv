I regret not taking 157 and 240 instead of 137 and 223,MudSnake12,1gvrqdp,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gvrqdp/i_regret_not_taking_157_and_240_instead_of_137/,1732115654.0,"Title. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time over this semester hanging out on the math floor at bahen, talking with professors and other students, and I found out I love math more than I originally thought. 

I wanted to do a cs spec, and all the Reddit comments were saying 137/223 are enough, but tbh I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve learnt much in either course. 223 is just computations while the proofs in 137 are relatively simple.

I know I can take 257 next year if I do well enough in 137, but I also wanna take 247, but idk if thatâ€™s possible without 240. 

Anyone whoâ€™s been in the same boat, what did you do? And how can I self learn the gaps between 137/223 and 157/240.",submission,43

And I'm like, a bit older now and managed to figure out how to fill in the missing bits. I don't know how to catch up fast enough that you can like, start taking serious math courses promptly or anything, but to at least get started:

1. go through Sheldon Axler's ""Linear Algebra Done Right"" - its quite short and does a good job at re-framing what you know from 223 in terms of 240. The problems (proofs) at the end of each chapter (only 10 shortish chapters total) can generally be done in your head, where once you 'get it' its clear you have the right answer. Once in a while you might need to write something down to make it clear to yourself.

2. Do the very first chapter of a textbook (I think on group theory? I'll edit this comment once my friend replies with the answer, since he is the one that recommended it) to get a feel for axiomatic set theory.

From here, you should honestly be able to pick up some more advanced books in most topics. I did this after my masters in physics, but my math understanding of group theory and things were (and still are) relatively shoddy. Nonetheless, I was able to start on eg Lee's Topological Manifolds book, with the aim of getting into Smooth Manifolds (also by Lee). These are graduate level texts in math, but the rate you can skip forward once you have some ideas for topology, open sets, etc... Its quite remarkable.

So yeah I guess for a step 3 before really digging into other things, Id recommend a bit more topology, at least until you have a good idea of continuous sets, open/closed balls, why inverses of functions dont always exist, but inverses of functionals always do and why that's important (hopefully I said that right...)...

In particular, having the topologist's definition in mind of a continuous set and what open and closed balls are helps a lot as a pre-req for most of the analysis courses offered (eg 257), even though they typically teach topology after 257... It honestly makes way more sense in the reverse order but c'est la vie I guess.",comment,12

Itâ€™s a very difficult course, but definitely worth it if you are very strong in proof writing and maths.

Tbh I find 157 much more enjoyable even though it is harder, so I also regret not taking 240 lol. I've talked to people that are in 137 and it seems like the content is very similar, but based on my experience that the people that take 157/240+247 vs 137/223+224 are very different. People in 157 seem to know what is going on and what they are doing, and I think that it makes the lectures flow more nicely. Whereas in 223 I see a lot of rich international students that aren't really there to learn, and I feel like the prof always has to stop and make sure that people are following along because he sees no thought behind our eyes. I know this is probably not the right word and it seems offensive but I just think people on 157 are ""smarter"" and easier to work with.",comment,1
