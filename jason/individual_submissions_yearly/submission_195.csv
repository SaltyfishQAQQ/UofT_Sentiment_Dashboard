I have just completed my last exam (hopefully) in my undergrad as a Computer Science student at UTSG. By the end of June, I will have my degree and I will finally move on to the next stage of my life. My journey through U of T has consisted of many ups and downs. I thought of sharing my story with you, hoping that it provides new students, hopeful students, and even graduating students with hope and advice.

My journey begins back in high school in Quebec. As a first generation immigrant, many paths were closed to me. Despite my high grades in (and love for) math back in my home country, I was pulled back by an educational system that prioritized French above anything. They treated me like a child, thinking I did not know basic math, all because I failed to answers some math questions in French. I went from being ahead, to being behind. I had no friends. A year later, my family moved to Ontario, were we hoped for better opportunity.

High school there was much more inclusive, and I was allowed to learn topics other than French and basic math. However, I was still behind, as my educational records from Quebec prevented me from catching up to where I was back home. I had to start from scratch. Despite being a Grade 11 aged student, I had to learn my way back up from Grade 9. My guidance counselors doubted me. They kept directing me away from a University career, as it might be ""too hard"" for me. I still struggled to make friends and know people. By the end, I was not able to take the courses I needed to become apply to an engineering program, even though I had to take an extra year of high school to get my diploma. I loved working with computers, so instead I worked toward applying to a computer science program. My grades were good but my family income was low. I could only apply to three universities. I was too proud and fumbled; I applied to U of T's, Waterloo's, and one (extremely safe) university's CS programs. I was rejected from the first two, to my dismay. Rather than going for my third choice, I went to U of T, which had accepted me into an alternate Math & Science stream. I thought: ""Hey, I love math. I might enjoy being a mathematician!"" That's how my U of T journey began.

I enrolled myself into the courses required for a first year math specialist, one of them being the dreaded MAT157. I also enrolled myself into the introductory CS courses (CSC148 & CSC165) for the Winter, hoping to at least get a taste of the field that had escaped my grasp. My Fall semester did not start well. I barely understood the material. ""What even is proof?!"" I exclaimed to myself. I went to office hours. I asked my classmates. All I got was encouragement to drop the course. After a failed term test, I felt stupid. I was out of place. I had no friends. I was far from home. I felt that I was a failure. I was depressed. I had made the wrong choice. I dropped down to MAT137. The material was much more comprehensible. I learned better from Alfonso's videos. Prof. Asif Zaman's lectures helped me understand the material better. I barely passed my Fall courses, but things started to look up. I had regained some confidence. I was looking forward to the Winter semester and those CS courses I had signed up for. Maybe I could get into CS POST if I tried hard enough! Then, the COVID pandemic hit.

Initially, things were not so bad. Classes were still in person. I was still confident. I worked hard day and night on my CS courses. I met classmates with whom I could study. I went to the Math Help Centre almost every day to excel in MAT137. I was doing good. CSC148 was fun. The exercises were simple as I already knew how to program. CSC165 was harder, but thanks to Prof. Zaman and Alfonso, I stood my ground. The news rarely bothered me. The pandemic might get worse, but I was still doing good. Midterms went well. I was getting to know people! But then things went online, and it was all downhill from there. Remove learning was much harder for me, it was hard to focus. Some exams got cancelled. I began to feel unmotivated toward school activities. I moved back from Toronto to my family home. In a way, I was lucky that things went online right at the end of the semester, as I did not miss much to the new synchronous format.

Thankfully, my grades were good enough for the CS department, so they accepted me into the CS Specialist program. I was so excited. That summer, I prepared myself for the Fall. Finances became hard at home due to the pandemic, so I went back to my high school job to make some extra cash, as I wanted to help my mother. I saved some money by the start of the Fall semester. I enrolled myself into the second-year CS courses, most of them would be during the Winter. I also continued taking some proof-based math courses now that I felt much more knowledgeable. Things were initially going well. The workload was heavy and my part-time job was taking much of my time. As I lived home, I also had to meet my filial duties, and so I helped my mother as much as I could with my siblings, who were finishing high-school. By the end of the semester, I felt burned out, but my grades were still good. Stats was a pain, but I was going to pass with at least a B. Exam season was coming, but I was studying day and night. Remote learning was definitely hard, but I was surviving! Then, the tragic news arrived home a couple of days before my first exam.

My father, who still lived back in my home country, had tragically passed away. It was no accident if you are curious, but I will not go into more detail. I was extremely close to my father. I talked with him almost everyday. The news shook my family. My siblings and I were devastated. I could barely keep my composure, I was in utter shock. We left for our home country the next day. By the time I was back, I had missed a few exams. I had tried to defer them, but without a death certificate from my father, the University was of no help. A month passed, I finally got ""proof"" of the event. My exams were deferred to April. Classes were still online. The Winter semester began. I quit my job, it was already too hard for me to focus in school. My savings were slowly drained away from legal fees and other costs related to my father's death. My mother helped with some of the expenses, for which I am thankful. I was able to focus all my remaining energy toward my CS courses.

For the Winter semester, I had made the mistake to choose CSC240 (yeah, I know) the enriched CS theory course. I could no longer drop down to the non-enriched version, as it was not being offered, so I chose to keep forward. I did well on the other CS courses, but CSC240 was on another level. My performance was average at first, but I soon felt burned out. I fell into and out of a depressive state constantly. I tried to get help from the University, but it was lacking. I barely passed the course. My grades dipped. I was in the gutter once again. The memory of my father haunted me. I felt alone. I had  no close friends at U of T. I cried for help, but no one came to rescue me. My family doctor refused to refer me to a psychiatrist. Exam season arrived, not only did I have to write the exams for that semester, but also all those exams that were deferred. Too many to count! Unable to cope with everything, and sure that I would fail most exams, I dropped some courses, with the help of the registrar. By now, I was three years behind everyone. Two years behind in high school. One year behind at University. My second-year grades were lackluster. I had tried and failed to get a summer internship, or into any research opportunities. Things were not looking good. I wasted away at home, depressed and without any prospects.

By the end of that summer, I saved some money and moved back to Toronto. Classes were back in person in third-year. I re-enrolled in the courses I had dropped on April. I had talked to an academic advisor on getting a job, they said the new ASIP program was closed to me as I was a third-year student. So they told me to apply to PEY to get co-op experience once the application was opened. Things started to look up again. I had regained my confidence over the summer. I was not feeling as depressed as before. I was still unable to get some help with my mental health, but I was managing. I then fell again for the overconfidence trap that had plagued the past few years: I enrolled into CSC265 (yeah, I know), the enriched CS data structures course. The material was very interesting. But my grades took another dip. My Fall semester of third year was the worst so far. I fell into a depression again. My confidence was so low, I was seriously thinking of dropping out of university and become what my high school aptitude test told me was best for me: a farmer. I gave myself another chance and I slugged through my third Winter semester. My mental health was in shambles. But I had not yet given up. For the first time in years, I started to do well again, especially in my CS courses. Sadly, I could not apply for PEY though, as I technically did not count as a third-year to my chagrin. I learned that one's year is determined by the number of credits one had completed. I was half a credit away from being counted a third-year. I tried getting an internship on my own. I failed. I tried to get into research opportunities. I failed again. Perhaps fourth-year would be better.

It was better. The Fall semester of fourth-year was not easy. I fell into a depressive state regularly. It was hard for me to focus in class. I gained a lot of weight. I barely slept. My mental and physical health both decayed. But at least my grades improved. My grades were average, but they were higher than before. I kept pushing myself forward. The Winter semester was hard academically. But I learnt how to manage my mental ups and downs. I forced myself to be in school physically. I went to the library and stayed there until late at night and studied. My physical health got worse. However, I was hopeful again. I changed family doctors. My new family doctor heard my story and immediately referred me to a psychiatrist. It would take a year before I heard back, but at least I knew I would get help someday. I started to see a therapist with the financial help of my mother. My mood improved slightly. Soon enough, things began to improve. My grades at U of T were the highest they ever were. Things were not perfect though, it was hard to focus both in school and in my day to day life. I failed for a third time to get work and research experience in the field. I gained even more weight. I slept only a few hours each night. Family conflict arose at home. But at least things were improving.

Onto my fifth-year, I had made myself a promise. That I would finish university once and for all and make the most of the time I had left. I began to meet people around the school. I found a mentor; he is an old man, but I have learnt so much from him. I took lighter CS courses and some electives. I started to have time to focus on my mental health. I was finally able to meet a psychiatrist. I was diagnosed with clinical depression and anxiety disorder. Things were official! I started on anti-depressants by the end of the year, and my mood began to improve. My ups and downs became infrequent. I was able to sleep more than 6 hours a night! My grades kept improving.

This last semester was somewhat tougher. The last few courses I need to complete were heavy and only offered this semester. I hope I did well on them, but I am sure I have passed them all. I am still on anti-depressants. My mood has improved greatly! I still see my therapist. The future is looking bright for me again. I do not have any jobs/internships lined up nor do I have any research opportunities on the horizon. But I am as confident as ever! Once I graduate, I will take a month-long break to grieve my father. I have pushed it back too long, and I know its unhealthy. But later is better than never. I am very overweight, but I am planning to work on that starting this summer. I thank everyone who helped me through this journey: my mother, my siblings, my mentor, my therapist, my new friends, the people I met throughout the years.

My regrets are many. First, that I pushed myself through university despite my grief. I should have not continued. I should have stopped right then and there, despite what everyone around me said to me. There is no rush to life, and sacrificing your mental and physical health is not worth it. Second, I shouldn't have fallen for the overconfidence trap so much. If you clearly cannot do something, its alright! We all have a different path. Mathematics did not work for me, neither enriched CS, but at least I know what I am good at now. Third, I really should have tried to meet people earlier. Help from others will make surviving U of T easier. I know U of T barely has a social scene, but even a little interaction with other students will help. I wish the CS undergrad community had a greater sense of comradery like the Engineering students, we would all gain much from that.

Life is full of ups and downs, that I know. But even when smacked down to your lowest, it is important to remember that things can get better. They might take years to get better. There is no rush to life, takes things one step at a time. Seek help with your mental health, seriously. The wait time is worth it! Don't be afraid to ask for help. Even if the University might have failed me on that regard, I found the help somewhere else! Grades, internships, research, none of those really matter. In the grand scheme of things, we all can catch up. Maybe it will be unlikely that we have a stellar career, but that is okay. I do not regret coming to U of T, even though I have made mistakes all the way through my journey. If you are suffering through something like I did (not necessarily the same, we all have our own story), know you are not alone. Seek help. It might take time, sometimes a long time. But do seek help.

Peace out, U of T. See y'all at graduation",submission,139

I finished my last semester of ECE just recently, and as someone who struggled with anxiety for the last 5 years due to family issues, it was incredibly difficult to push through. I still have many regrets regarding the way I handled my academic journey and personal life.

Seeing your story was very inspiring. We both pushed through despite our shortcomings!
