The wording says “obtained credit”, which is more general than the scenario you’re describing. The UofT policy says “if you simply re-submit your old assignment, you are not “learning” rather taking the easy way out of engaging in your studies”. Your situation would violate the spirit of the policy. Academic offences aren’t a court of law, and they can penalize you for breaking the spirit of a rule.

That being said, there are lots of situations where students want to take an old paper and build it up using new academic skills or knowledge! It’s a common enough academic practice. Talk to the prof and they can give you some guidance on what they would allow and what level of reworking would be needed.

If you resubmit a similar essay with enough overlap in content, you will get flagged for plagiarism, even if it’s on your own work. 

This is an academic offense. See this as an opportunity to improve your work. Ie, you’ve already wrote something similar, see where ya lost marks and how it improve the essay altogether. You can use it as inspiration, but you can’t just copy and paste it (or do anything that can be considered plagiarism).",comment,5

You can get flagged for plagiarizing work that you wrote yourself. And yes I agree, this doesn’t really make any sense - but I suppose that’s how the rules are. 

In a way I can see how this can be considered to be a shortcut; if you just happened to have an essay that you wrote in another course, but it also happens to be suiting your needs in an entirely different course. I don’t suppose the professor would be very happy. 

Then again, I still don’t see why students wouldn’t just take this opportunity as a lucky chance to improve on your previous feedback and write a stronger essay. Obviously, you can take inspiration, maybe the flow of the essay, but the rest should be different. 

UNLESS, you’ve spoken to your professor and they have given you approval to do so.",comment,1
