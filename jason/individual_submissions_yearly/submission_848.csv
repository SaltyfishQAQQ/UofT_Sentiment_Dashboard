For those who lived in res before, was stealing an issue at all, and how does the university handle possible cases? ",submission,19

They basically implied the blame onto me about losing my watch and how they have more important things to deal with. Supposedly most thefts are from students leaving their items unattended in public spaces. Their job is to keep ""the students safe"" not really their belongings.

Dorm thefts are quite rare. Your roommate is unlikely to steal stuff but if they bring lots of people over then you're more prone for getting stuff stolen. Which was what happened to me. One of my roomie's dates prolly stole my smart watch, the spare watchband, its case but not the proprietary charger to charge the thing üíÄ. 

Just bring the bare necessities to live as a student. If I were to redo first year I would have bought a cheapo CASIO watch from Amazon and used that instead.",comment,5
