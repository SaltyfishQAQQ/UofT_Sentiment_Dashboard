How does going to the gym work ? first time gym goer advice please,ExoticLengthiness892,1h5ejt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h5ejt5/how_does_going_to_the_gym_work_first_time_gym/,1733197889.0,"So I've been running a lot in the past couple of months, primarily outside on a trail close to my house but it's getting cold and icy. Now I need to start using the gym treadmills, which is a bit harrowing since I've never been before. I'm probably going to go to the athletic centre, and I commute so take that into account if need be.

My main questions are:  
\- Are there individual showers at the Athletic centre? Or is it like a communal situation (I'm a girl if that impacts it)?  
\- For lockers, you bring your own lock right?   
\- What hours would be the best to go (not too many people that it's crowded, but still enough that I don't stick out)?   
\- and what are the general vibes/any tips or advice for a first-time gym person?

Idk let me know pls I'm scared. ",submission,18

Only because the winter storm hit and I found it very inconvenient to have wet hair. There is a shower place that’s kinda communal, meaning you walk in and see shower stalls, I think that was connected to the toilets, which also were of separate stalls. I think there were a few shower spots that had no walls or doors but I assume that’s to just shower before entering the pool. Yes you need your own lock, but there are also benches and stuff where you can place important items with you like (if you had a lululemon fanny pack to hold your wallet, keys, and T card… but honestly no one is stopping you if you wanted to bring a drawstring bag with everything). 

I didn’t have class on a certain day until like the late afternoon noon, so I think I went 10-12pm (again, I also didn’t go anymore not because I was scared, there was just no time and it started getting real cold). I think there were 2 middle aged women there between 10-12 in the pool, and maybe 1 other woman in the showers. Overall, facilities felt clean and seemed like ppl used them often. The only weird thing is that the pool was disconnected from the locker rooms. So there was a whole cubby place with benches you had to pass with your towel… and it took like 2 minutes to walk to get to the pool.",comment,2

And just try things out if you are curious about a machine (either ask, or just google what to do), You are doing the right thing by showing up and working on self improving. I think the hardest part for me was that I had no one to go with, so that’s why I went to swim once and told myself the “cold weather” wasn’t worth going anymore. Anyway, fast forward to now, while I only go to the gym once a week (well not during finals), I go with my family and to see my grandma. We all work on the row machine for about 20-30 minutes, some of us bike, some of us walk around to cool down. Some of us try a new machine. 

Everyone else does their own thing at their own pace. Also, most teens and adults are wearing noise cancelling headphones, so eyes aren’t wandering and ears are not judging conversations. I think everyone is just trying to break a sweat and maybe trying to keep their eyes of their devices for an hour or two! Good luck and enjoy it. Take it one step at a time.",comment,2
