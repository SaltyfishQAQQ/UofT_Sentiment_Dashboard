Why do people say GPA doesn't matter? ( question) ,Rough-Form6212,1de74bb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1de74bb/why_do_people_say_gpa_doesnt_matter_question/,1718200172.0,"I remember when I graduated people said it wouldn't matter much. 

I had a 2.5 when graduating u of t ( econ ). 

I even when back to school and did a fast tracked 1 year program in accounting with a gpa of 3.5. 

I actually went through the school portal and applied to a really small church A/P role. It is probably the more ""entry"" level role possible and not even at a proper firm but at a regular church. 

The person looked through my most recent gpa at my graduate school and then still asked for my transcript and gpa from my undergrad. 

I also think it is largely to do with Canadian job market being very competitive but jeez, its almost like they were looking for flaws. 

Anyways, I guess it doesn't really apply if I was applying to retail. But any real technical role seems to care alot. ",submission,59

Occasionally, if you don't have any experience or internships, an interviewer might ask for a GPA. But once you have experience and going from job to job, you'll be talking about what you did at the last company or companies. I've never had to provide a GPA and most companies are interested in competitor work experience. ",comment,99

But right out of university, especially if one doesn't have applicable work/industry experience, employers don't have much else besides your GPA to determine whether you'd be an asset or not. Especially in today's economic climate, there's no shortage of potential employees with good grades and work experience so it's even less likely that a firm will take a chance on someone with poorer grades or a lack of experience unless you have something others don't (special experiences, etc...)",comment,11

Theres always employers that will nitpick all your achievements so you feel grateful to accept less. i Personally dont believe a gpa means anything, i had a high one but all that means is i can write essays and memorize for a standardized test, ive seen brilliant people with low gpas that maybe cant write as well but have way more practical skills than i ever will ( I did architecture)",comment,1
