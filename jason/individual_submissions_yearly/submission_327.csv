People were saying that going through lectures for 7 hours a day is harder than work because you're taking in 100% new information that entire time. And I'm saying that lectures should never be 100% new information, they should be review. Yes this isn't feasible for students who are working full-time, but that's their loss. 

I never argued against that, you're just randomly bringing up how in your specific situation my strategy wouldn't work. I'm talking about the other 80% who aren't actually working full-time while in uni where my strategy would work because they have the time to learn 1 chapter ahead. I did this while working part-time and had absolutely 0 issues.

Edit: I responded with something sensible and bro instantly blocked me. Crazy shit",comment,0
