Feeling lost as a 3rd year ( no long lasting friends) vent ,Forsaken-Ad-7826,1cdswde,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1cdswde/feeling_lost_as_a_3rd_year_no_long_lasting/,1714156488.0,"Hi guys i just kinda wanted to vent to my fellow UOFT students. I’m a third year student  and i feel very lost. I feel like i have no experience with the field of work i would like to pursue after graduating and it makes me feel like im falling behind. I’m majoring in cog sci and minoring is soc and psy. I really want to have some experience with that but don’t know where to start. Also I’ve actually made no long lasting friends in all my 3 years here. It’s not because I’m introverted because I’m extroverted but every friend i make seems to never last and we just fall out (not because of anything bad but just lose touch). I also don’t live on campus so it’s harder to meet up. I also work on the weekends and Friday so i really don’t have any time to do extra things. It’s really taking a toll on me and i feel super lonely and lost at school sometimes.
 Has anyone else experienced this ? Thanks for listening. ",submission,18

I also commute to downtown, and especially since we were part of the COVID batch, our first year and a half was just online and alone at home. I've also made no friends, just because I feel like everyone (especially at this stage) already has their own friends and whatnot. 



Feel free to reach out to me in DMs, let's talk :)",comment,6

What I learned was that it's better to focus on yourself and your goals rather than making decisions re: friends. They will come and go, I promise. It's the way of life.",comment,7

Honestly i know it’s arbitrary but it sometimes feels like im being left out of the “university life,” that is supposed be so fun and what not.

I did have the university life, I lived in rez, moved out with some friends to student housing and lived with them for four years. And yet the only one who I am still close with is someone I met in one of my classes that I never lived with. I think my life is littered with people I was once friends with and we have since gone our separate ways. But you make new ones along the way. Many of the people I am friends with now, as a professional with a career, I met quite randomly actually. Stay active in the things you like doing and you will find people along the way. What I did regret though was, realizing that university friends drifted apart anyway, spending so much of my youth worrying about them, about not having enough, and going out of my way rather than spending that time on myself (to meet my academic and career goals, etc).",comment,2
