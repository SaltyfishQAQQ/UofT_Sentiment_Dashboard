How to pressure UofT to respond to sexual violence related accommodations?,de997,1eiyxw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1eiyxw8/how_to_pressure_uoft_to_respond_to_sexual/,1722676219.0,"Hi, I recently encountered a sexual violence incident on campus, the campus police did not catch the person, after that I stop going to campus as it no longer feels safe for me. I’m taking summer courses right now and have been communicating with the university (mostly sexual violence prevention center) for accommodations such as lecture recordings and online tests. It’s been 2 months yet the university still hasn’t arranged even one midterm. The coordinator keeps saying that they are trying to come up with specialized accommodations and all I can do is wait. 

I’m an international student and I’m paying $6000 per course. I cannot afford dropping courses. For the past months my mental health has gotten even worse with the lack of response and just complete indifference from UofT. It’s so traumatizing that I had been admitted to ED and am still taking meds.

I honestly don’t know what more I can do and to whom I can ask help for. My needs are to get refunds for the in-person courses I didn’t go to, and transfer/take courses on other campuses in fall, but I got waitlisted for almost all my required courses and there’s like 80 people before me. I really appreciate any advice if you know what else I can do to get the university to respond ",submission,35

In terms of accomodations and the coordinator, take it up to accessibility services. Frankly, the sexual violence prevention center is useless and just an extension of campus security. Your best bet is to explain your situation to accessibility services and see what they can do for your assessments. 

For refunding missed content, that will be a case to make to your faculty's registrar/student accounts. 

Incidents happen all the time and it's more often approached via a case by case basis. I wish you luck.",comment,23

Furthermore, accommodations like lecture recordings and alternative formats of tests are more likely to be honoured under disability-related circumstances, as UofT and professors are required to adhere to the Ontario law that mandates disability accommodations at universities (AODA).

Since you are taking medication and were admitted, the health specialist that you are actively working with should be able to fill out a certificate of disability that would allow them to provide formal recommendations for academic accommodation.

The process is quite tedious, but I would advocate to the front desk saying that it is urgent. If you miss the deadlines for receiving accommodations for exams/midterms, there is the option of having such evaluations deferred/made-up so that your make-up evaluations will have accommodations implemented.",comment,11

I am actually connected with Accessibility and other departments, but they decided to hand my case to SVPC solely. I’ll email the registrar to see if they can refund based on my case. Also I have reported to TPS. Hope they catches him soon so that no one else needs to deal with all this",comment,7

A psychiatrist had assessed me and provided the certificate to uni, but again all my requests for virtual accommodations are still not responded.
