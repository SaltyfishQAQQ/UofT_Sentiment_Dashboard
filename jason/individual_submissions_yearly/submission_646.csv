No way he directly contested the TA just for the camera issue. I mean i get his point but as the TA also mentioned, he could have brought up the issue way earlier. I felt sorry for the TA because the guy who has an issue with the camara should bring up the issue to the professor, not the TA.

  
And yea, surely this course will definitely going back to in-person class after all those chaos happened in the online tutorials",submission,29

Some universities have said that profs cannot require that the camera be turned on, citing some kind of human rights or privacy -based argument. I donâ€™t think the accessibility issue holds water, as there are likely camera ready computers available in libraries or for loan to students who donâ€™t have them. In my view, if a camera is required to confirm participation, it should be stated in the syllabus so students can be prepared with the equipment.  Awarding grades for discussion participation is one way of rewarding students who might find traditional exams challengingâ€”it recognizes different learning styles and indicators. Unfortunately some students try to game the system.",comment,9

The instructor needs to know that they are present and not signing in and fing off. Having said that, what most classes will do is say they want ppl on screen but if you don't want to be, that's OK you just need to speak up so they know youre there. Otherwise it is warranted that you don't get attendance points.",comment,1

Students used to have their camera on in the first two weeks but literally no student has their camera on now. Very odd that students have to switch on their camera while the TA isnâ€™t required to,comment,1

Itâ€™s a requirement to have a webcam, mic, good internet and up to date laptop. We also have to submit an assignment before the class. So the teacher checks and if you donâ€™t have it, youâ€™re kicked out. Then you go into groups and the teacher basically creeps on you and listens and watches each group.  Sometimes they stay more in stealth mode and you wonâ€™t even realize they are there! But if you leave or do nothing, again youâ€™ll get in shit and get no marks!",comment,1

However, in the past tutorials, many people only showed up for attendance, and when the TA assigned us to random groups, some of them just left the Zoom call or remained dead silent during the discussion. Then the professor decided that enough is enough and required everyone to turn on their cameras in the tutorial. However, one of the students claimed he did not have a camera on his laptop and believed that requiring everyone to turn on their cameras was unreasonable, thinking it violated U of T accessibility policies. The TA countered that if he had a technological issue, he should have brought it to her or the professor at the beginning of the semester. They continued to argue for another 6,7 minutes before he left the call early.
