**update:** this is getting too popular for my comfort level. The overall consensus seems to be not a problem but be careful to not feel pressured and be aware of the underlying power dynamics. Also some stupid incels comments.",submission,368

No ethical worries on her part, but she did say imagining there were was what made it fun enough to go on one date, but not enough for two.
