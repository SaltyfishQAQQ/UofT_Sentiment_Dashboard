How do you actually do readings for the lecture? ,Hoboin,1fh20zf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fh20zf/how_do_you_actually_do_readings_for_the_lecture/,1726366260.0,"When you do the readings before each lecture, what exactly are you doing? Are people taking notes? What kind of notes? How detailed notes? Do you just skim before lecture to know what the content will be so you're not confused during the lecture but your goal while readings isn't to actually understand it, or do you actually commit to understanding it as best you can before going to lecture? 

On average, each course has about \~50 textbook pages for each week. From what I assume people are doing, you skim through to get a general idea of what you're going to study, but you don't actually understand complicated concepts. Then, you go to lecture, understand what the concepts are. Then, you go home, open the textbook, and go through it properly and take detailed notes to flesh out your lecture notes and actually understand the concepts properly. 

Am I dumb or is that how people actually do it? Is that all there is to studying? Forgive me if i sound stupid, I just genuinely don't know what people mean when they say 'studying' because I didn't grow up going to school like that. 

Please, if you can, actually let me know what you are doing, when you do it in relation to lecture + how that ties in with exams, and how you take notes, I'd really appreciate it.",submission,33

So your focus should be in making sure you understand what you’re reading, and flagging any topics you don’t understand so you can ask questions if they’re raised in lecture.",comment,19

Clarify those spots during lecture, either the material covers it, or you ask the professor. Then after the lecture reread the readings and ensure it makes sense (here it’s better to take/add formal notes to what you already have from lecture). 

Most readings have a blend of providing the perquisite information to a lecture so you can understand the professor and material to contribute and ask meaningful questions, and also some rigorous research/proofs that provide support to material you learned in lecture that may appear to come out of nowhere. 

Usually, if I skim it and understand the material strongly in the lecture, I don’t reread it — straight to practice questions. 

Else, it’s skim -> didn’t get it -> lecture -> somewhat get it -> reread -> got the hang of it -> practice questions. 

You can change this to match how you learn. I tend to realize some courses just shove a ton of proofs and complicated concepts in readings that aren’t really there for anything outside of completeness - for those, you can tell by the first midterm (you can tell none of the reading material is tested) so you can start to ignore those unless needed.",comment,8

This can be a learned skill in itself; when you have a reading you should be trying to ask ""what's the thesis of this reading?"" and ""what are the main points of this author's argument?""


Read it even if you don't fully understand it; that's what the lecture is for. Reading it beforehand ensures that you have some level of preparation for class. I've had some instructors tell us not to bother coming to class if we haven't done the readings, so interpret that how you will.



Since many of my classes rely on these same readings for a later essay or exam, when I'm preparing for those I go back and summarize my highlighted sections to ensure I remember the core arguments or nuance of the readings as well.",comment,4

If there’s no guiding questions or anything similar, I just read the material as a preliminary thing sometime before the lecture (usually a day or two before) without taking any notes, and actually take my notes during that lecture. I don’t know if this is a good strategy or not  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ ",comment,3

If you're like me and you're a slow reader, I can understand the frustration. I'm starting to learn speed reading techniques to help me pick up my pace so I can read the required materials before my lectures to better understand them, but the issue is I subvocalize the words in my head while I'm reading so it slows me down by reading as fast as I can speak. So I picked up some speed reading techniques to try over the next few days to see if it's a good fit and using your finger as a pointer while you read can help cut out the inner voice that narrates the reading for you and just digest what you're reading as raw information.

I asked a buddy of mine who graduated UofT for help with readings and he summed it up to

 ""80% of what you're reading is bullshit. Look for key concepts, themes, people of significance, and information you deem important. Then try to summarize your understanding of the chapter in your own words"". 

Hope the best goes well for you and your readings and best of luck throughout the semester!!!

I prefer doing it later to consolidate my understanding. 

That being said, I would suppose that a skim/read through for the first time just before the lecture will likely help a decent much. Obviously, it is great if you understand everything, but if there are parts you dont understand, or would like a clarification, you can note it down and ask the prof during the lecture (or even try searching it up on google or smth before class)",comment,2

if the reading is not from textbook but an article that the prof picked, and the prof talks about the reading in lecture, I felt like it’s more important to read those thoroughly. If they don’t test the stuff in textbooks then I don’t read it at all (often the case for my engineering course). You can prioritise how much you read based on whether the lecture & tests would cover the reading material.",comment,1

I personally find it fine to just show up to lecture and take notes. No need for supplementary reading (apart from answering specific questions/knowledge gaps I may have along the way).,comment,-1
