The median of the second MAT133 midterm at UTM was 27%,Kreizhn,m1lbrhe,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hc4avq/the_median_of_the_second_mat133_midterm_at_utm/m1lbrhe/,1733952920.0,"To head this off before people go crazy, we've [already discussed](https://www.reddit.com/r/UTM/comments/1hbhckp/mat133_which_will_not_be_curved_midterm/) this over in r/utm.

Some key points:

1. Students this year have been abnormally weak in pretty much all classes. There has been a downward trend since the pandemic and we have no idea when it's going to bottom out.
2. We asked OP to show us the test, and he just disappeared and never said anything. But then one of the TAs showed me the test. It wasn't particularly difficult. It definitely covered all the material that is normally taught in that class. 
3. The coordinator who runs the course is extremely thoughtful and well known at UTM. He is generally loved by his students. This isn't a matter of poor teaching.

I haven't been given permission to share the test, but the gist was

Q1: Find the values of a,b that make this 3x3 matrix have no solutions, one solution, infinitely many solutions.

Q2: Find the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of this 3x3 matrix.

Q3: Count the number of 5 card hands that have no jacks and no clubs (this isn't taught at St.G, but probability and counting is part of UTMs curriculum).",comment,226

It's worth pausing on that one for a moment. It was just a regular old 3x3 matrix (no variable entries or any tricks), and the task was to do a thing students had seen and done several times before. 

It's essentially impossible to create a more straightforward question on this topic.

The only relevant math I have taken regarding that is MAT188 which is the Engineering Linear Algebra course in first year. And eigenvalues and basic matrix properties as such could be learned without much context needed off YouTube. 

In fact, if it was actually a 3x3 the first question could be done at the high school level with just the understanding of system of equations. And the second one is like 1 step further.

I’m not well versed in probability. But even then, average should’ve been around a 50 if you drop the last question and account for minor errors in the first 2.

I have a hard time believing anyone seriously studied for this midterm….even cramming a night before would’ve been enough to pass..

Also, just reading the other thread. No reason this should be curved. It would literally hurt the university to let students pass with such underwhelming results.",comment,30

Yup, it is as you said 36 choose 5, but you also have to make sure to use combinations and not permutations because order is irrelevant.

Since it said to count the number of hands of five cards that contain no jacks and no clubs, the number of possible combinations is as follows: 36!/(5!31!) = 376 992 possible hands. 

Where there is 36 cards available excluding the jacks and the clubs, so the total amount of combinations possible with 36 cards is 36!/(5!31!).

It is not as straightforward as it seems, and maybe students might have made the same mistake as you did. I suppose we should be less harsh with them given the standard of education of incoming students due to COVID-19 and the shortage of teachers.",comment,-1

Physics midterm required more calculus than what we had learned in our calculus class to that point.

What you are counting is actually the number of hands with at least one club or jack in it.

This clause is correct. That number, which is 36 choose 5, is what the question is asking for: how many hands can you make from the pool of non-jack, non-club cards.
