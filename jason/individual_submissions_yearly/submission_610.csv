He flunked 3rd year life sci with sub-50% in just about every class and got booted from the university. Ended up redoing the entire program, took around 7 years to graduate, and then graduated with a 3.3 iirc. 

Started his own side hustles working three or four jobs to pay for extra certifications and classes, now CEO of a branch of a large pharmaceutical company and making extra 100k a year from consulting work on the side. Very proud of him.",comment,51

I had to redo them over the summer. After that year my annual GPA would improve a lot but my cGPA would never truly recover. My last year I had a lot of A and A+ but I think I still ended up at 3.1 or 3.2 cGPA?

It all turned out fine for me. I now work in HR in the pharma industry and earn six figures. Unless youâ€™re going to academia for further education, honestly, GPA doesnâ€™t matter much.Â 

Good luck!Â ",comment,15

from that semester onwards, i took 6-7 courses per semester including summers and especially summer. only took it down a notch this semester due to burnout. 

flash forward to now, i am en route to convocate in november (2 courses left in the summer), meaning i have finished my life sci bachelors in 3 years and i have just accepted my offer for uoft accelerated nursing bachelors. i will be attending that for two years and go on to practice as an RN (with plans to further certify myself).

Background: During my first year, I finished 2.0 credits during my first fall/winter semester and ended up doing late withdrawal or dropping the rest, gpa avg ~ 2.7. Then, I survived by taking summer school and just finished my 3rd yr life sci (gpa avg ~ 3.3). This summer, Iâ€™ll be a part time student while doing a RA work-study position & a research volunteer position at a hospital 

So as you can see my GPA is quite average and somehow I get those positions. Although Iâ€™m lucky to have a supervisor who was willing to take me in as a RA, I also give myself some credits for my work. 

1: I take courses that are genuinely interesting to me, not bc theyâ€™re bird courses. 1st yr is a bit rough but 2nd yr onwards give you a lot more options
2: Make connections with others, including your Profs. It sounds like a daunting task when youâ€™re aware of how little you know/understand smth. Trust me, youâ€™ll gain a lot more from asking questions + receiving answers and they probably wonâ€™t remember you
3: Find a hobby, ex: workout -> Youâ€™re paying tons of money to invest in yourself not the school. So take advantage of it and make yourself feel happy. (Ex: working out isnâ€™t enjoyable but you feel so so much better when youâ€™re done with it)
4: UofT students are decently bright people. This is a very good motivation to work on yourself even harder and take inspirations from others. Ex: ask them which profs are helpful/nice to students, how do they study

Some simple tips but they took me a long way to learn! Hope it helps and pls pls have faith in yourself. You can do it!",comment,2

Pulled through until graduation and finished with 3.7, which still wasn't anywhere close to being competitive for med school. I never found memorizing things to be interesting, and excelled at critical thinking. Switched to tech afterwards and loved it . No ""success"", just enjoying what I do for a living.

Thinking back, I had sunk cost fallacy. Should've switched program after first year. But it worked out in the end.",comment,1

1. Dishwasher

2. Technician and door-to-door salesman 

He put in a shit ton of extra hours in the kitchen, was a hard worker and people liked him, so they introduced him to a junior position in a pharmaceuticals company where they put him on the marketing team thanks to his door-to-door experience. Pay was pretty bad starting off, long hours. He worked his way up to earning commission, still at a horribly low rate, and earned unusually high sales. 

Basically kept getting promoted because of it, jumped companies a few times though because they still were paying him peanuts compared to other places. LinkedIn helped, as did going to company events and meeting business associates. Heâ€™s very strategic about only promising what heâ€™s 100% sure he can deliver, so he built up a good trustworthy reputation in the industry.",comment,4
