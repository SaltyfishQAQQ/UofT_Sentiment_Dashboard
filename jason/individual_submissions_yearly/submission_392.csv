They weren't lying about MAT137 ******************,deleted,1fqebhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fqebhr/they_werent_lying_about_mat137/,1727406613.0,"When this course started out I didn't think it was so bad, so I procrastinated my first problem set to the last day. Literally gave myself 3 hours before the deadline. Well I can barely figure out these problems, and the few I can solve take me like 30 minutes each. Thank god only our top 6 problem sets count, I think I'll just study harder for the next ones and submit the few answers I have right now. I just wanted to rant about how hard this course is (tbf this is probably mostly due to my laziness)

Let's hope I pass this course lol",submission,65

They actually aren't that much work if you spread it out and give yourself more time to think about your answers.

Also, I really really recommend trying to complete the first problem set, or at least part of it, anyways even though you can't submit it. They are really good practice for the tests.",comment,7

Ngl, the first few problem sets were just literally impossible to solve on your own in a sitting, but once you build the mat137 intuition, the second half of the year kinda smooths out and the problem sets are easier to understand since you start thinking differently.",comment,1

The good news is that you have time to learn from your mistakes and do better next times ! I also recommend you to learn the questions in the pset well cause they are part of the learning growth and it builds up your understanding in this course so yeah I wish you best of luck and stay strong man !!,comment,2
