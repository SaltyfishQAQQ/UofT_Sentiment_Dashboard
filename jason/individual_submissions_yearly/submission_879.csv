Difficult concepts on probabilistic machine learning, heavy on math, but the course material is really interesting and fulfilling. The assignments are fun and relatively easy, exam gets curved. The average was mid 70s",comment,3

Anyways, consider that you need 1.5 400-levels to graduate. Most of the 300-levels are not that hard as the ones you've listed here, though.

The difficulty really boils down to how interested you are in the topic. Students who are very interested in the topic of the course tend to enroll in it very early (in the first 10s) and are very unlikely to drop. Whilst students who enroll in it because ""it's a credit they want to do"" enroll in it late, and are more likely to drop the course for that reason.

Based on what I've seen, CSC401 and CSC412 are very hard. Only take CSC320 if you have an intrinsic interest in it - though many find 420 easier (these two courses are very different and do not depend on each other).",comment,2
