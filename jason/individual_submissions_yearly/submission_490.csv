Doesn‚Äôt really make sense, especially because we don‚Äôt get to know what we did good on/what we need to improve in order to become better students. ",submission,48

They just send you a grade out and if you think it's fine you'll not see your paper. 

Then the exam viewings come 3 months later by which time you might not care or have moved on. The viewings are free though. 

The university is too big I think. There are way too many students and they need some mechanism to reduce their end of semester load.",comment,56

I was freaked out when I found I scored 60 on my term paper only to see my TA penalized me more than 20% for not citing that there are many animals in Canada as if it weren‚Äôt common knowledge in a 3rd year geographical ecology course. Successfully appealed it, but I think there needs to be more transparency when human error is very real.


Shouldn‚Äôt have to pay extra just to point out their mistakes in a service we‚Äôre already paying for.",comment,14

Part of it also comes down to class sizes, but also individual instructors.  You're less likely to see final assignment/test marks back from large classes, but I've had a few over the years who made that extra effort.  It has also been more common for me to see those marks back in my higher year classes.",comment,8

Laughs darkly in budgetary knowledge. 

Canadian universities *do not* make profit. They essentially aim to break even but are constantly behind due to delayed building maintenance.
