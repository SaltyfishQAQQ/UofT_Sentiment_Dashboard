I think the key to it is just time to adjust to the grading scale. At UofT, the grading scale is 100-90= A+, 90-85=A, 85-80=A-, 80-70= B‚Äôs, 70-60= C‚Äôs, etc. Generally to convert to the American scale you‚Äôre used to, add 10 mentally to your grade. It takes some time and patience to adjust, but you‚Äôll get there eventually.

Additionally, at the university level, more is expected compared to high school. In high school, if you checked the rubric boxes, had decent analysis, etc, you‚Äôd probably get an A or A+. Due to the university setting, you have to go above and beyond to get those types of higher marks and produce truly excellent work (especially in humanities/social science). So, I would recommend to give your best work on the assignments that count, closely listen to your feedback, and not feel too disheartened by your grades that look lower than you expected",comment,13

To get 85+, an essay has to be exceptional, one of the best. depending on your goals, a 73 is nothing to be too disappointed in, as you're probably in the top half of the class.",comment,2

I‚Äôm not going to lie though, UofT is savage with the fact that 79% = 3.3 and 80% = 3.7. The system really works for you if you‚Äôre killing it but then can snowball against you really quickly. 

I think its somewhere between the US and UK we‚Äôre in the UK first class honours is only over a 70%, our equivalent is like 80%, and the US I guess it is like 90%. I think this is because universities in the US commonly curve their grades.",comment,1
