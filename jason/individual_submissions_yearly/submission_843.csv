Update Email from UTSU about Mental Health Coverage,dyegored,1fikcj3,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1fikcj3/update_email_from_utsu_about_mental_health/,1726531574.0,"I reached out to the UTSU about the significantly reduced mental health coverage with the new health care plan (that I only found out about from reading on here) I received a response from the VP of Finance Operations and it sounds possible that they've just restructured the plan in some way and it still has very similar coverage just through a new fund seperate from the Green Shield Insurance. The email in its entirety is below. 

I will say that the registration form for the ""Mental Health Support Fund"" link doesn't currently work, so I've already let them know about this. The email... 

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well.

We are pleased to announce important updates to our health and dental plan that address your recent concerns. To ensure that your healthcare premiums remain among the lowest in the country and to enhance our support for mental health, we have made significant improvements to our coverage.

New Coverage Structure:
- 80% Coverage: We now offer 80% coverage for initial mental health visits, up to $400 per year.
- Additional Support: An extra $1,100 per year (at $100 per visit) is available through our UTSU Mental Health Support Fund.

Continued Maximum Support:
We are maintaining our $1,500 yearly maximum support to ensure comprehensive care while keeping overall costs lower for everyone.

Why This Change?
Our commitment is to make mental health support more accessible and affordable. This new structure reduces out-of-pocket expenses for initial visits and maintains strong support for long-term needs.

What Does This Mean for You?
- Lower Initial Costs: The new 80% coverage for initial visits reduces per-visit costs, up to $400 per year.
- Increased Support: You have access to up to an additional $1,100 ($100 per visit) through the UTSU Mental Health Support Fund.

We believe these changes will provide greater support and make mental health services more accessible. For more detailed information, please visit our website: https://utsu.ca/mental-health-support-fund

Thank you for your continued feedback and support. Should you have any questions or require further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact me.",submission,18

So they have extra money to bring the funding back up for mental health, but it's opt-in only? Seems like the mental health support fund link just went live: [https://www.utsu.ca/mental-health-support-fund/](https://www.utsu.ca/mental-health-support-fund/)

Kind of suspicious that they're asking you to submit your direct deposit information and therapy receipts through Google Forms instead of doing everything through Greenshield. It's good because it seems like they are responding to the backlash, but these are exactly the kinds of barriers that make access to mental health inaccessible in the first place.",comment,21

If I submitted a claim through green shield I could get my initial direct deposit to my therapist after every visit back within a few days, so the financial burden of therapy would be returned before the next visit. I don't have 1100 dollars to sink into therapy first before being reimbursed.",comment,5

They seem to just be deciding the premiums are too expensive for the insurance they/we want and are taking a gamble of sorts that it would be cheaper to insure us themselves as an organization.

I will say it's annoying that we have to navigate two different processes and I understand your point about that being difficult especially when mental health is a concern.

The other points people have raised about privacy, etc. are also valid ones.",comment,3

The negotiation broke apart, and they're most likely not prepared for such a situation judging from their reaction. Otherwise, the fund would've been set up and announced long before the start of this policy year. It's unlikely that they can run a mental health coverage any cheaper than a commercial insurance company, so I don't think their original intention was to set up this fund. The fund is more like a reactionary remedy to the backlash which is very likely to get out of control from their perspective",comment,2

It's a brand new thing and can't be used until you exhaust your green shield coverage so no one has likely actually used it yet. 

I would assume this is something that's done per session as you would need to submit receipts and so you don't need to exhaust the full $1100 (many people might not even use that much, for example) but at this point, it doesn't seem clear for sure.

I will agree that once my therapist's details were approved after my first session (that one took about a week or so), reimbursement for future sessions always came within a couple of days from Greenshield, which was certainly appreciated.",comment,2

Also, they're definitely a large enough organization that they could set up coverage cheaper than a commercial insurance company. Commercial insurance companies suck. Without a profit motive, this sort of group insurance could potentially be better for everyone. In fact, I think some commercial insurance companies (The Cooperators, for example) started with this basic concept.

Either way, this is *at least* better than the first news. I see some people are upset and want to elevate the issue, but they can't exactly charge students a more expensive insurance premium now so best case scenario seems to be they get better ""official"" insurance for next year.",comment,2
