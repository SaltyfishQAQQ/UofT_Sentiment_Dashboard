I need to pass POST first year so I want to have a light workload in my 5 electives. Does anyone have any suggestions for easy courses? If you're a CS student what courses are you taking/did you take?

Also, I plan to do a double major, but I don't yet know what my second major will be. Does it matter if I take random courses first year, or do I have to start taking courses for my second major right from first year?

Thanks!",submission,19

Consider opening up the academic calendar and browsing. Find things that look interesting to you and look at if they belong to a major or fill a breadth requirement. There's so much offered that you might never have thought about before, including for majors (or minors - you can do a major and two minors).",comment,8

Could crush your GPA because for most people the transition from highschool to uni is already heavy and CS courses are (in my opinion) heavy workload compared to others. 

I recommend CSC110, CSC111, MAT137 (required); MAT223 (medium workload, useful for future CS courses; STA130 (if you want to pick up a minor in Stats, heard the material is not too similar to upper year STA courses you need in CS but lots of CS people take it); some Breadth courses (SOC100, CLA204, ENV100, HPS120, MUS courses, PSY100, first year foundations courses, etc.)",comment,6

Everyone else is trying to fool you. You need to take CSC240 in first year and then go on to take CSC265 in second year.

You will be virtually UNTOUCHABLE after this combo. People will bow down to your footsteps every time you enter Bahen.

Even the female CS profs will be all over you. You will be a legend among men. Third and fourth year will feel like preschool once you've passed these two courses.

This is the path of the warrior. The path of honour. The only path if you want to fulfill your destiny.

mat223 you can take in second year but it's highly recommended you take it in first year

csc240 if you're feeling up for a challenge (if you're not confident, you could try it out but have plans to drop it)

as for the rest, I'd recommend taking whatever seems interesting and matches your breadth requirements.

PHL245 is a very easy BR2 for cs students, if you need it I would highly recommend it.",comment,2

sta130, mat223 (recommended and easy/light classes)

mat224 (harder class but still recommended for more mathy parts of cs)

after that you can take anything you want. take some breadth courses or start a minor.",comment,2

First year foundation courses are small classes restricted to first years, to help with the whole transitioning. List of them here -> https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/section/First-Year-Foundations . But when it comes to workload, it really depends on the course. I took CSB199 and it was really light, GPA booster (approx. 30% group presentation, 30% essay (can be done with a partner), 30% participation and no final). But I’ve seen other ones with more heavy workload. It really depends on the Prof and course.",comment,3

Some of it was team work but my team mates barely understood English and would always talk in their native language and I had to do it all on my own 😭 and prof was so strict with grading.  She barely tried to understand the situation. Foundation courses are a hit or a miss in terms of GPA booster. Some of them can be very easy while others can downright horrible,comment,1
