I am ofc at uoft and am taking 4 courses but already struggling. Getting assignments in on time isnt too hard for now (since theyre very quick) but i am having trouble getting myself to study for midterms. I have 2 next week and have not fully started studying. So, how do fellow adhd (ideally in stem) students w/o meds deal with their adhd to do well in courses? Any tips and tricks would be appreciated, thanks! 

(Im gonna try and start studying now lol) ",submission,24

I've been using ovel.sh to help me stay on track. It has a work grid that encourages you to log hours of focused work, a daily journal for notes, and you can even set goals and break down tasks. Might be worth checking out!",comment,6

I'd put all my effort into trying to work through that and only get halfway through by the time of the midterm/exam. So instead, I worked backwards. Start with the most difficult problems/concepts and if I couldn't figure it out or properly understand it, try to figure out what fundamentals I was missing. I found that ended up being a way more efficient use of my time, and it did a much better job of motivating the whole thing and keeping things interesting rather than building up by wading through a sea of basic stuff that will only be like 10% of the midterm, and which will usually naturally be covered by the later topics.



YMMV, but you might find study groups helpful in keeping you engaged and on track. I personally found it impossible to focus when working in a group with others, but it's definitely a good thing to try if you haven't already!",comment,6

Like literally just mindlessly open my laptop and have the work in front of me. Once I get a start it feels sooooo much easier to just keep going.

I'm on meds for my ADHD and in my 3rd year at UofT. Have you tried body doubling? By that I mean studying with someone else there who is also studying. I do this with my friends all the time and it can often really help. Just having someone else there that is also doing work can be motivating. Make sure you've caught up with them recently or schedule time for a coffee beforehand so you're not just chatting through your study time the entire session haha. Otherwise, I find the pomodoro method to be really good, and making realistic goals that I can get done within that period of time. Its a big dopamine rush to check off something on a to-do list :)",comment,2

After working full-time in an office job for a couple years, I had an issue with my meds and ended up having to temporarily go off them. My sudden inability to do even 50% of what I used to be able to accomplish actually put me into a mental breakdown. While it's really important to work out strategies, medication can be such a game-changer, so if you already have the diagnosis *do not* let yourself procrastinate on that!",comment,2
