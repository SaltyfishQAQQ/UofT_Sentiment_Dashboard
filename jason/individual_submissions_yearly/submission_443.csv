"MAT244 has gotten weird, does any one else feel the same?",Quaterlifeloser,1ft9mcu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1ft9mcu/mat244_has_gotten_weird_does_any_one_else_feel/,1727738187.0,"ODEs have been around for hundreds of years and have existed as a course for who knows how long. Yet this class seems completely improvised (it's apparently revamped for this semester). We spend all of our lectures monkeying around in excel, meanwhile our assignments don't totally resemble what is taught in class. 

Much of our assignments require calculus (no surprise), yet I don't think we've done a single integral once in lecture and it's now week 5. We're left teaching ourselves the mathematics outside of class... which you would think would be the point of attending math lectures. 

I have no idea why they've decided to teach ODEs this way. Is anyone else in the same boat or am I missing something? ",submission,55

I stopped going to lectures week 3 and just exclusively studied from the textbook.

Thankfully, it seemed like the exam questions were much more similar to the textbook than the lectures lol, because the average for all the mid terms were dreadful.",comment,1

I canâ€™t help but feel that itâ€™s a form of hubris for a prof to not just pick a canonical textbook and just stick to following that with its plentiful practice problems and examples. For example it doesnâ€™t seem that Eulers method is an extremely large focus in most textbooks (though theyâ€™ll obviously have a chapter on it) but itâ€™s been the focus of our lectures. Which I think is disproportionate because it looks like the easiest concept to grasp here. IÂ swear even the openstax textbook I had for 136 covered more than what weâ€™ve done over these 4 weeks. Maybe though the profs are on to something idk.Â ,comment,3

In 136 in fall 2023, they covered ODEs with an assignment where you had to use a model from a scientific paper in excel, if they were able to do that in 136 then itâ€™s clearly not the most difficult part of ODEs.Â ",comment,2
