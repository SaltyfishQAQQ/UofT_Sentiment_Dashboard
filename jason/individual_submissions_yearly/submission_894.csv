I want to start a bioethics debate club but so far I am the only member ,deleted,1eiitk7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1eiitk7/i_want_to_start_a_bioethics_debate_club_but_so/,1722626756.0,"Hi everyone!!

I’m going into my third year at UTSG and I’m doing a major in bioethics. After tons of looking I can’t seem to find any clubs that really dive deep into bioethics and debate sensitive topics like genetic testing or even euthanasia. 

Obviously, people who join me now would be my admins and execs as I have NOBODY interested in joining me (all my friends are life sci and have other obligations such as execs in other clubs they founded) 

Feel free to private message me! I’d love to talk about this more with people interested. 

EDIT: @orgforbioethicaldebate is our Instagram handle, all communications and openings for exec positions will be delivered though there! Thanks everyone :) ",submission,16

If it’s relevant then profs usually don’t have a problem forwarding emails or including it in their announcements.,comment,11

Cause that's something many clubs miss. There are free tools like  [Zation](https://zationapp.com/) and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/notion-for-student-orgs-apply) that help with this.,comment,1
