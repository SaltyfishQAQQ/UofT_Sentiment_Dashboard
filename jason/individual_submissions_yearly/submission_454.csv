Hi guys, my high school offers a 5 course semester and I am considering to fill those slots with Math 20-1, English 30-1, Social Studies 20-1, Chemistry 20-1 and Physics 30-1 for next semester. To add to this, I am also a club president. To anyone that took this path, will it be hard? Will it ruin my overall academic performance? Did you guys have burn outs?

I'm worried that I won't be able to handle it, however I want to this so I can focus more on applying to colleges next year.

He has a good average but other people have been talking about how hard it is to get in and he wants feedback from current students on how they got in. (He goes to a TVDSB public school so hopefully his marks are not considered inflated)

He has around a 97% average right now for the following courses:  
Physics 94   
Adv function 98   
Calc And vec 96   
Accounting 98   
Personal finance 97

He doesn't have a lot of ECs (JA VP finance, some math competitions (no great scores) and DECA Provs but I don't think UOFT comp sci cares

For his sup apps, it was questions about taking initiative in his life, taking leadership, and a lot of how he manages to do self-improvement. 

He talked about how his mom had to return to Korea for Cancer Treatment when he was in early High School and left him and his sister with a guardian who didn't live with them. His paragraphs focused on how he took care of himself, took care of the house and regulated his and his sister's life (cooking, cleaning, laundry, and all the basic chores) after pulling himself together from a bad life habit he developed at the start of his mom's leave. He was nervous because he wasn't sure what UOFT was specifically looking for.

He wants to know his chances and if he should aim for a higher average :)",comment,3

physics: 90%

chem: 91%

and then I'm taking anthro, comp sci, and bio this semester.

next year im taking: calc, data management, trig, comp sci, chem, physics. with 2 spares and im taking english over the summer. im worried about:

1. uni will look at me taking 2 spares and rejecting me
2. my grades are too low even though they wanted to compact functions physics chem and bio into the first semester until i dropped bio for second sem

Hey Eveyone,
I‚Äôm In grade 11 rn, and today is the deadline to submit my course selections for grade 12. I really don‚Äôt know what to do, cus there r so many different combinations. Here is all the info:

I will definitely be taking these 6 grade courses:
ENG4U (English)
MHF4U (adv func)
MCV4U (calc and vec)
SCH4U (chem)
SPH4U (Phys)
HRE4M (mixed religion)

So, all of these 6, I need cus they r required for engineering programs, other than religion (I‚Äôm taking it cus it‚Äôs mandatory at my school, and even though it is possible for me to be exempted from it if I don‚Äôt think I want it, it is definitely a course that can boost my grade a lot, so I will for sure take it)

Additional info:
I am currently taking MDM4U (data management) and ICS4U (comp sci) rn in my grade 11 year. I am expecting to get low to mid 90‚Äôs in data management, and mid to high 90‚Äôs in comp sci


What I need help with üôè:
Well, there are a few things‚Ä¶
1) should I take 1, 2, or no spares: Do u guys really think they help reduce workload and are actually useful? How many spares did u guys take in ur grade 12 year? How many do you think I should take based on the info I‚Äôve provided?
2) Looking back at the 8 grade 12 courses I listed above, 5 of them r very difficult (the 5 mandatory courses required by uni programs), and they will take up 5 spots in my top 6 grade 12 U/M courses, meaning I only have 1 more course slot left to boost my  admissions average (not overall average, as I‚Äôm pretty sure top programs only look at your admissions average, comprised of your top 6. PLEASE Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong). The 3 courses that are currently contenders for that last spot are ICS4U, MDM4U (both of which I‚Äôm taking rn in grade 11), and HRE4M (which I will take in my grade 12 year). So, my question is, (and this is leading on from my first question regarding taking spares rather than easy courses), do you guys think those 3 courses are sufficient enough to be able to be my final course for my top 6 (this final slot is purely for boosting my grade)? Should I take 1, 2, or no other easy grade boosting courses? If I should, what are some really easy courses you recommend?
3) my 3rd concern is about what I should do in the summer holidays. I am confused as to whether I should take the religion course in the summer, or instead work some kind of job or do some volunteer work to strengthen my supplementary applications. If I take religion in the summer, it will most likely be easier to get a higher grade. The issue is, I‚Äôve heard that top programs don‚Äôt care abt courses taken in the summer, and that if I get a really high grade in religion during the summer, they won‚Äôt count it. I‚Äôm also concerned that if I take religion in the summer, I won‚Äôt get time to work a job or do volunteer work. So, is it true that top university programs don‚Äôt count summer courses? Should I take religion in the summer school, or work a job/volunteer to have something to write about in supplementary applications?
4) lastly, I‚Äôm confused on wether or not taking rly easy grade boosting courses will actually help me. If it is true that top university programs only look at top 6 for admissions average, then that means there is only one a lot left for my top 6 (as the other 5 slots are taken by the mandatory courses I need to apply), and that taking a bunch of easy electives, only for one of them to count, will be a massive waste of time and effort, and might hinder my ability to get higher grades in the actually important courses. Please tell me your opinions on this.



Important things to keep in mind when answering my questions:
. I really don‚Äôt know much about admissions average vs overall average. Please try to adjust your answers and help me decide courses and different options based on your understanding of how top university programs interpret averages.
. Remember to keep in mind the two grade 12 courses I am taking rn in grade 11 when answering the questions, as they may contribute to the topic of taking spares vs easy elective courses



Please answers all questions as details as possible with thorough explanations. You guys don‚Äôt understand how much this means to me and how much I appreciate ur efforts in helping me out. Thanks alot guys!",comment,2

**Diploma/Degree Date**¬†¬†  
**Enter a date if you received the degree or expect to receive the degree at the end of the current school year. (Postsecondary and CEGEP institutions only.)**

Am an out of province student, and my grades are generally in the low nineties to mid 80s except for one exception.

These are my grades rn, although I am a bit disappointed I think I'll have to try much harder for the rest of the year.

Physics: 92.1%

Pre-Cal: 94.2%

ELA No.1: 84%

Photography: anywhere from 90-80 prob like 85 ish though

Gym: No Grade

Bio: 92% (final grade)

Comp Sci: 85.5%

Only Notable EC is volunteering at my church.

The exception is a pretty big mistake on my part and a culmination of incompetence and a little bit of bad luck, my second ELA grade is a 20%. I do have a lot of (imo) valid reasons for having a low mark like a 70% or a 60%, but since a 20% is harder to get than a fifty with any effort put into the class I‚Äôm very disappointed in myself. I tried to get my teacher to change my mark to incomplete until it was improved but they thought I was just trying to hide it from my parents (wasn't even thinking about it but now I realize they'll see it and get really mad) and by the time I finally got to talk to them and they said they had kept the 20, it was too late to change it. It‚Äôs already in the transcript and too late to drop it.

Should I apply anyway? Or should I give up and just apply to my local uni? Are there anymore EC's that I can get that still give me time to study? I was thinking something like building an mp3 player (might not do depending on cost, time consumption and difficulty) or a couple of CompSci projects would be a cool side project since I'm interested in both CS and EE.",comment,1

I know it's mentioned that repeated courses will not be counted for more competitive programs, I'm applying for the humanities so I'm hoping it will count (I saw the option about special consideration as well and due to my circumstances I may consider submitting it.)

My main concern is, if I apply now (I know it's already too late, the deadline is tomorrow) will the second take's grade show up on my transcript *now*? And if not, will the grade for the first take affect my chances of getting accepted?",comment,1

So, right now I'm taking Grade 11 Biology, Function, so that I can get the Grade 12 level of those courses next semester (needed prerequisite to study Psychology in a number of Universities (Main choice is UofT)) Since midterms will be posted this weekend I embarrassingly say that in that 2 courses I have bad grades, passing, but not high enough. Due to me being diagnosed with depression and schizophrenia(now taking Escitalopram and Risperidone) I strongly believe I still have a chance to improve my grades. My family are now telling me to apply to the universities in OUAC to which I lied to because of me overthinking and being anxious of being rejected. The deadline of the application of my program is in January and I did a little bit of research that the admission cycle is between February and late May. I fear that I'm not sure I'll do a great job improving this semester since I just got my medicine this week. Now the question! When I submit my application does UofT or my plan B universities will look at my current Grade 11 courses or just wait for my Grade 12 grades next semester? Sorry if that question might come as dumb.

I am currently in Grade 12 and doing an early application for the TrackOne engineering program, which requires me to do a Personal Profile.

**My first question is:**

For the personal profile, after you are done attempting the practice questions, are you put straight into the actual profile questions or can you choose when you want to do them?

**My second question is:**

Does anyone also have any tips on preparing for the actual questions in advance?

The university page and many others say there isn't a way to practice. but for me, if I don't practice I feel that I might screw up during the actual interview day.

**One last question I want to ask is:**

I currently have a 94.33% average so far from Mid-Terms (97 in Chemistry, 96 in AP Advanced Functions (the course code is MHF4U0), 91 in grade 12 English, 95 in both grade 11 French and Grade 12 Specialized Comp Science, and 92 in Pre-AP Physics).

I participated in 2 different sports teams, from grade 10 to grade 12 (I will participate in one again in grade 12), volunteered at an elementary school to help teachers and tutor grade 3-4 students, am part of my school's Math Contest club and AP Physics club and have been participating in various Waterloo Contests over the years. I am also part of a specialized program at my school. I am also part of my school's robotics team, though as a trainee (I did partially participate last year but in a very small amount) and am planning on tutoring students at my school.

I know that I am giving out a lot of information and it seems quite unnecessary, but I just want to know where I stand in applying, my chances and the things I should improve or get to work on.

I originally applied to a few universities (except for UofT, big mistake) for biomedical engineering, but I ended up going with the program I'm in now. After doing a ton of research I realized that a mechanical engineering degree is more suited to work in the field I want a career in after university, and UofT has basically all the things I want to study/learn in their mechanical engineering course syllabus.

I am an international student aspiring to apply for the UofT Computer Science program. I have an overall IB grade of 35/45 with a 7, 6, and 5 at HL (Math AA, Physics, and Chemistry, respectively). These are my retake results from the November session after sitting my original exams in May 2024.

In terms of experience, I am familiar with both frontend and backend coding languages and have gained hands-on coding expertise. Additionally, I have leadership experience, including serving as president of the student government, math club, and other school organizations. I also collaborated with an NGO to support refugees and volunteered at orphanages.

On the extracurricular side, I hold certificates in sports such as tennis and swimming and have achieved recognition in international math competitions (2019-2020).

I'm in grade eleven and hoping to apply for poli sci (not till fall). are my grades realistic for the program (as an out of province student) or should I consider other undergraduate programs good for pre-law?

English 20 IB - 90%

Math 20- 90%

Social Studies 20 IB - 91%

Physics 20 - 90%

Drama 20 IB- 98%

Chem 20 - 75% (hoping to replace with a higher grade in Science 30 or Chem 30. Alberta uni's only require 5 core classes and I realized too late Ontario universities ask for six core classes.)

My extra-cirruculars are: President of Speech & Debate, member of student support club (selective club- by interview only), president and founder of the council for theatre, and cast member of after school play/musical all three years.

I also have large amounts of volunteer experience, and come from a selective academic school.

I don't want to get my hopes up too high if my grades aren't quite competitive enough-- and to also look into less competitive undergraduate programs if need be. I know someone who got into U of T for sociology but she had multiple regional awards and a higher GPA. I know my grades are quite competitive for my province but unsure if it would be the same at a more selective school like u of t. :)

edited to add this after reading some comments-

I'm not sure about the grade inflation at my school. I go to an (publicly funded catholic) academic school that requires 80+ averages in all middle school classes for admission, however as more and more people have started applying that has become more competitive. due to this, even with harsher marking and more advanced classes, students tend to do well on average as most students already possess good work ethic and understanding in their classes. around 70% of students graduate with honours. there is approx. 5% grade inflation between classes and diplomas, however students tend to perform better on the diplomas than surrounding schools. the classes and content are harder and more advanced than other schools in my area (as well certain courses overall are considered more difficult in Alberta than other provinces) so I'm not sure if that will inflate grades or not or if the overall strong academic performance of my school will deflate my grades-- even though my classes were quite difficult and my (and other students) grades are the result of intense work and effort put into every class.",comment,1

Last year I got accepted into UofT Social Science Program, but I was unable to go because I ended up not getting enough highschool credits for my diploma. I'm not going to list all of my excuses, but in general my mental health was very bad. 

My grade 9-10-11 average was high 80s and low 90s, which is why I got in. In grade 12 my average dropped to low 70s and almost even high 60s... 

I quickly completed an assignment that gave me the final credit that I needed in November, and now I'm just waiting for my application results to come in.

How does UofT look at your grades? Is it the top 6 marks in your transcript including the required courses and the top scores of any other? I absolutely suck at English and Social Studies and currently have an 86% average on both. If I keep those marks up, will they heavily affect my admission chances? I excel in other subjects and mainly those related to my desired major (e.g. 94 in Science, 95 in Math).

Also, does UofT take in account class rankings and rigour? For example, if my English class has an average of 65\~70%, will they consider that, or will I get automatically filtered out by the system if my grades end up being below the requirements? My English teacher commented ""exceptional reading and writing skills \[...\] analyze texts, craft thoughtful responses, and engage in discussions is impressive"" but I'm afraid that admissions officers won't look at that.

I am a grade 12 student from BC who is attempting to get into the UofT paramedicine program. I'm very torn between going into a science program at UofT (like biochemistry) or going into the paramedicine program at UofT and would like to ask some questions to help me decide where to go.


1. How would you describe the paramedicine program? Is it difficult? Fun?


2. What are the benefits of this program as opposed to simply going to college and getting a paramedicine diploma?


3. Is it easy to get a career as a paramedic with this degree?


4. What are the benefits of this program as opposed to getting a science degree (chemistry, biochemistry, etc) and then getting a paramedicine diploma after?


5. Is it possible to go on an exchange while studying paramedicine?


6. What is the UofT Scarborough campus like? Is it a nice place to be and stufy?


Thank you so much!",comment,1

I saw on the UofT portal that there is a monthly round from Jan to May. But I also talked to someone at UofT and said it's different for out-of-province students, but in my experience, all of my out-of-province friends got offers the same days as what the UofT portal said (Note that they didn't apply to engineering though). (And I saw some people here getting offers for UofT engineering outside of the rounds). Does anyone know how it works?

For some additional information, the application portal says this right now: Your application is complete and will be reviewed by the Admissions Committee beginning in the next few weeks. You may continue to make changes to your online Student Profile as needed. (My friends says shortly, instead of a few weeks, should I be worried?)

from your marks you're definitely a strong student academic wise, depending on which eng you pick i'd say if you do just slightly better with a good supplemental you'd be a solid applicant. but please just chill bro you're in grade 11. i've heard uoft eng specifically doesn't like if you take a prerequisite online even if its something as easy as english, but don't take my full word for it. considering youre applying to engineering, most competitive programs incl. waterloo will ask you why you even took the course online and will penalize you if there isn't a good reason (having a 'hard' course load probably isn't the best reason fyi)",comment,1

If by spares you mean electives purely for fun or to boost marks:

No it won‚Äôt be a problem, in fact I think I got in (Im in Art&Science) with the help of getting A in visual art and language course (both have no use at all for getting into programs)

If by spares you mean empty slots on your timetable:
Some of the best peers in my highschool had ridiculously empty timetable because they finished courses early, and they had some of the best admission rates, with grants from places like CompSci and Math and pre-Med from UBC to Waterloo to U of T. I had an empty morning class that I could sleep in back in highschool. Don‚Äôt even start to worry if you got empty, take it as your deserved rest. 

But in terms of your grade:

Yeah you‚Äôll probably need a bit more to be competitive, based on what I saw in my Engi friends. BUT! you can apply for an easier program as backup (you can send two applications to U of T, I did, one reject and one admitted, that‚Äôs how I ended up here) Just know that to gain knowledge and certificates for engineering you don‚Äôt necessarily have to be in U of T. Having backup plans is always good even if you get admitted.",comment,1

The reality is that you will encounter parties everywhere on campus, but they are fairly easy to ignore and pretty much only happen Friday night.

However, do try to see if you can get your English grades up to the 80s range; it might be unrealistic for English 11 (I don't know your class's grade distribution) but definitely aim for the 80s in English 12.

As for scholarships, it depends on what type and what campus. Here's a link: [Admission Awards - Future Students. University of Toronto | University of Toronto](https://future.utoronto.ca/finances/awards/admission-awards/)

Automatic entrance scholarships, for example, are based on your average. Each campus has slightly different rules and standards (Ex. UTSC lowest possible award is an 88% average for 1k; UTM is 90% for 2k; UTSG main campus is more ambiguous), but for the other awards, it will largely depend on a handful of criteria not limited to your GPA that I do not have the knowledge to comment on.

Edit: might still need a CS major to specify about your chances.",comment,1

FYI, here are the stats for admitted students following an American curriculum (from U of T's website). A CGPA of 3.7 = approximately 90% (an A/A- in the USA). I believe it's closer to 3.8 now, actually. Unfortunately, unlike Ontario students, you will not be able to cherry-pick your top 6 grades. U of T will be looking at \*all\* marks from Grades 11 and 12. (Source: the U of T recruiter who visited my kid's school last month.) Not sure what their IB stats are like, however. As for the SAT, though it's test-optional, the conventional wisdom is that if 50% or more are submitting scores, you should probably do so too.  Their SAT range is 95th to 99th percentile, so no, I don't think it's easier for Americans to get in.

# Middle 50% data for admitted students from U.S. high schools:

* 50% of admitted students submitted an SAT or ACT result
* The SAT score range for the middle 50% of admitted students was 1430-1540
* For the ACT, 32-35 is the range
* For CGPA: 3.7 to 4.0",comment,3

Extra: if you want to know the 2 main reasons that I got this low of a mark is

1. No pc to type on, used to use my old pc but it was broken. Only got to borrow my sisters laptop once when she was free at the beginning of the school year, but after that I wasn't able to use it. I did buy parts for a pc, but the ram got delayed and building it+getting windows on it after it did come took me a couple of days as I didn't have much experience with pc building and not much free time while exam season was coming up. I should've just typed it on my phone but by the time I got the message that the ram was delayed I didn't have enough time to even complete the page requirement much less any semblance of quality writing. I should've just started writing the start on my phone when it was assigned but it's too late to change anything now. (The reason I didn't was because I hate typing on cellphones and thought the pc would come fast enough to just build and work on it)
2. Had three exams on the first day of exam season and I wasn't aware we were allowed to request an alternate exam schedule time until after. Studied it the least and you can see how it turned out lmao.

I don't blame my teacher at all btw, this is all on me and at least a lesson for the future me to not try this type of shit again. But I still really want to go to uoft Mississauga or any uoft campus really",comment,1

All of the Life Science Programs across all 3 campuses are pretty similar in their requirements. I had a 96% average out of grade 12, but I had friends with low 80's get in as well. All this to say, any average above 80% and you can almost consider Life Sci a safety.  
I don't think they realistically care much for AP's, so don't worry about those. And no, there's no need for you to mention your school's grading standards (I don't think at any point in the application you can do this anyways?)

Do they take into account rigorous gradings? I'd imagine no. It's much too time tedious to check on every schools grading systems and see how other students fared.

In terms of classes I took, I had Advanced Functions (aka pre-calc), Religion, Calculus, French, Physics, Biology, Chemistry, English. Remember tho, only your top 6 classes are taken into account when calculating your admissions average, alongside the requirements (which I believe to be English and Biology, while Chemistry and Physics are only recommended.)

Edit: so, short and sweet answer. You have an amazing, nearly guranteed chance to get in with your projected average (anything above 85% gives you an amazing shot) and no, not taking AP classes, and if your school had a ""harder"" grading system is not considered in your application.",comment,1

Quick answer: No, they won't think that at all. Thing's like expulsions and suspensions all show up on your academic record, if there's no evidence of those, they won't think you got expelled. I didn't report any extenuating circumstances when applying, simply listed it from when I started to when I left for my new high school, and well, here I am as a UofT student haha.

Don't stress at all, they won't think anything of the sort! 

As for your transcript, 2 things. 1, they don't care about Grade 9 marks, I've met people who had 50's and 60's during grade 9, but have been accepted to various programs, and some rather competitive ones.

short answer, yes! your new grade will show, but not **now**. Once the midterm is released, it will show up on your transcript. UofT can see that you are currently taking the course, but won't any actual numbers, it will simple say ""ENG4U: In Progress"". 

Will it affect your admission? Yes and No. Yes it will for early admission, after December 2nd, No it won't. as English is required for every degree, it's always taken into account when doing your admissions average, and a \~55% will be a big hit. However, once your new midterm grade comes out, they can use that instead.

All this to say, you most likely won't be considered for early admission, which is entirely okay, but you will be considered properly for all the rounds after! Just make sure to keep that English mark up and every other class too!

I‚Äôm sorry for these issues you have to deal with, but it only adds to how impressive and strong you are for dealing with them!

To answer your question, and just for the record it‚Äôs not a dumb one at all, everyone has wondered this! They will look at those grade 11 marks just for early admissions calculations, until you get your grade 12 marks. Meaning once you get your grade 12 marks released, they won‚Äôt care at all about your grade 11‚Äôs, so please don‚Äôt stress about that!

Psychology majors typically request for a high 70s to mid 80s average, but I‚Äôve seen people in with mid 70s, so do understand even if you‚Äôre not doing as well as you hoped, you still have a solid chance, just keep working and doing the best you can :)",comment,1

Grade 11 grades are only used as substitutes until you take the grade 12 version. Meaning your grade 11 chem would only be counted until you got your grade 12 chem

Sadly, this likely means your French grade will be included until next semester, mais ne t‚Äôinqui√®te pas mon ami! Once those next course roll around and you get the midterm for them, your French grade won‚Äôt be included at all.

Think of them like houses in harry potter, they're basically your community on campus. Being part of a college means you'd live there (if on residence) or have access to anything in the buildings. 

Differences between them really come down to just how new they are, some colleges are extremely new, only a couple of years old while some have been there since the university was founded. And extra applications, for example Trinity College is a ""private college"" where you have to submit an application to be there (not too hard to get into, I got in spending like 5min on the application but just didn't go to UTSG)

People's opinion will change based on who you ask, because they are all in different programs and have different ideas of what ""hard"" is.  Im personally not too depressed, im lowkey happier than I was in high school, but im in first year, so we will see what happens later.  But I wanna say that in high school, I always checked which university my teachers went to on OCT, and in my experience, the teachers who went to UofT always seemed happier than the ones who went to other universities.  As for murdering your GPA, unless you are next level smart, you GPA will probably drop compared to high school.  But if you have no plans for education after undergrad, it doesnt matter that much, Cs get degrees.  Hope this helps.",comment,2

Ultimately I believe that if you work hard, and more importantly, are interested/find interest in your coursework, you will do well. Personally, I've always chosen coursework that piques my interest, not based on how easy other people say it is, and I have found that that has made my experience much easier than those that pick courses based on how easy they perceive the classes to be. That said, I've had lapses in motivation, difficult semesters, and have felt a lot of stress at times. But you're at university - it's not supposed to be easy, your goal is to learn. Don't read into the weekly ""life is suffering"" posts, people who are doing well or having a great time at UofT aren't posting about it on Reddit.

Objectively speaking, if I understand correctly you have a 7 in Math AA HL, which is really impressive - however, your overall score is on the lower end for being accepted to CS by domestic standards. In my year (2020), many students in the 36 - 39 score range were rejected, but I know people who got in with lower scores than yourself. That said, doing so well in Math HL (and pretty well in physics) should be valued quite highly. I myself was not able to get a 7 in Math HL. Coding experience is not really a factor in admissions these days, but you could write a pretty decent application with your ECs.

I would strongly recommend staying with your parents. It‚Äôs actually quite common after first year. Schedules in university may seem a lot more spacious in comparison to high school, however you are expected to do much more work independently. So a lot of this extra space in your schedule will be filled with prep.
I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll be able to earn enough to cover rent and bills, so you may have to take out loans to pay for rent and that‚Äôs a very bad financial decision. Additionally, as you may already know, you can‚Äôt use an undergrad in psych without more schooling. So think about all the money you‚Äôll need to support yourself financially beyond that initial 4 years. And you need to do well enough in your classes for you to be able to get into a grad program too.

Law programs are grad school, so im assuming that for undergrad you are either going into humanities or social sciences.  Both humanities and social sciences need English grades in the 80s range AT LEAST.  Your other marks look fine (math doesnt look good but they only look at top 5 + English, so its fine), but you need to lock in hard for english in grade 12, aim for a high 80 or ideally something in the 90s.  Don't feel discouraged, once your Grade 12 mark comes out, your Grade 11 English mark will be disregarded, so if you really lock in, you should be fine.

If I am applying for Political Science at U of T (St. George specifically), then do I need a supplementary application? I don‚Äôt think I do, but I wanted to triple check.

From my knowledge you don‚Äôt. But any possible supplementary forms should be listed in your uoft portal. So if there‚Äôs nothing there there is no supp app 

> also, is it possible to somehow submit a supplementary application even if it‚Äôs not required? Or is it not looked at?? is that even an option??

The only thing of that sort that I know of is special consideration. If there was something serious in your life affecting your performance you can indicate that through that process and they will assess you more holistically.

A high average is only one part of the equation; there are a lot of engineering applicants with a high average because its so competitive.  The supplemental application matters a lot too, possibly more than the average.  Did he have solid extra-curriculars (2-3 long-term commitment)?  Did he do well on the video interview?  How bad is the grade inflation at your son's school compared to other schools?  Its really hard to tell with engineering compared to other admission categories.

But when you say 'slots don't fill up until the end of the application process,' does this mean the application date doesn't matter? I just want to make sure.",comment,1

Also, thanks for your worries, but it's not that I am bad at math. My mental health took a massive hit through the end of the first semester to the start of the second semester, so there was a split between my tests which were 96-97s and tests which were 50s or 60s, causing those averages to occur.

i don't want to discourage you and say a 90-93% in what are pretty difficult courses is absolutely horrible and that you have zero chance because you still do, you just have to do *even better* than what you just achieved. the 'everyone' you see are a very small sample compared to the entire entering engineering class. i dont know what stream you want to do but typically for the more difficult and competitive streams (think: engsci, ece, etc) have those students with those kinds of stats, but other engineering streams have averages closer to what yours is currently. i know someone that got into chem eng with a low 90, so anything is possible.

and to be honest, i like that your extracurriculars have nothing to do with engineering. from thousands of supplemental applications how many do you think have the typical hackathon, robotics member, creator of generic clubs on them? yours show that you are well rounded and have many passions, and for instance if you expanded on how those extracurriculars help you and lead to the eng stream youre interested in, thats a pretty unique experience that  can help boost your overall application. obviously what i suggested isnt the ONLY way youre supposed to do it but its just one idea and i have absolutely no idea what the admissions committee looks for, but dont discourage yourself early on and DO NOT go into robotics unless its something you are equally passionate for. there is a slim to none chance you will even enjoy robotics if you chose it for the sake of entering university and other aspects such as your gpa will suffer because of your aversion to it",comment,2

Now, as to what I mean, it's just as we both said. grade 11 marks, or your junior year marks, are only used for consideration during early admission. However, those marks are still considered ""less"" compared to the midterm/first quarter marks, which are released before the early admission deadline. As all acceptance letters are due in May, you'll have received your final marks for the first half of the year, and marks for the third quarter as well, and so your grade 11 marks around this point are irrelevant.

So, a summary: Yes, you have entirely have a chance to be accepted into the computer science program, and yes, your grade 11 marks matter, but only in terms of early acceptance, after the first half, they are no longer considered.",comment,1

3. I am academic driven and therefore i do enjoy being and studying at u of t.

I called the people who look at the resumes (i forget what they're called) and I asked them:  
""does it affect my chances of getting in if I take English over the summer?""  
""no""  
""what about for engineering?""

""no""

""are you sure?""

""yes""

  
and that was the end of that. but I'm still worried since that's only one person.

  
should I do early admissions?

  
also if I do like better in grade 12 are they gonna care about my not-on-par grade 11 marks? also I'm a little concerned that if I'm getting 90's in grade 11 that I'm gonna cook myself in grade 12 but I'll just study super hard

you don't ""do"" early admissions btw, you just may receive an 'early' offer because you applied before the recommended deadline on ouac (typically in november) besides, uoft does admissions on a monthly basis, they do one round every month with the earliest being january and latest being may. even if you apply after that date, there are several universities that offer admission on a rolling basis (ie. you can literally get accepted to some university after applying 2 days prior). there is absolutely no advantage getting accepted early vs late in my eyes 

on the topic of grade 11/12 grades: all universities give conditional offers of admission based on whatever your available grade 12 ones are, and use your 11th grade ones as placeholders for when the rest of your grades come in. you technically WANT to do better in grade 12 than grade 11 since those are the primary marks that get used to assess your application and to meet your conditional offer (when you receive an offer, they will tell you that you need for instance a minimum final mark of 80% in calculus to maintain your offer), no university will penalize you for doing significantly better by grade 12

to be honest i dont really remember how much i used to study in highschool LMAO but i always did extra textbook questions and overall tried my best to keep up and do active recall of what i learnt that day in class. grade 12 was definitely a stressful year not only from some hard courses but because it was super easy to fall behind and have to cram a night or 2 before the unit tests lol. i guess in a way it prepared me really well for uni since everything goes by very fast so you really need to stay on top of your courses",comment,1

So, let's say you wanna become a biology major. Even if biology is the worst of all grades, it‚Äôll still be used to calculate your admissions average.¬†
But after your prerequisite classes are counted, they‚Äôll just take your top marks to make your 6 courses.

AP is definitely a boost for admissions (only if you have good grades obviously) but the advantage of AP applies to all programs.

if you get a high 90 from night school, i don‚Äôt see why they would not consider that especially since your school doesn‚Äôt offer enough courses. universities don‚Äôt really discriminate high schools based on the limited courses they offer, so if night school mattered to them, that would be weird.

generally in admissions, unis want to admit as many competitive applicants as they can. i would recommend emailing the eng faculty if you are genuinely curious though. hope this helps.",comment,1

Yes, you should entirely apply early. Early admission gets you seen, and sort of puts you on their radar. Also, you have a significantly higher chance of getting in when you apply early, as you get to participate in an extra round of applicants, rather than the regular 4 rounds.

No, they don't fill up spots before deadlines are reached. Grade 11 marks entirely pale in comparison to Grade 12. Put simply, a student who did ""ok"" in grade 11 (like an 80-something% average) but did wonderful in grade 12 with a 90%+ average, would have a higher chance to be accepted than someone with the 90%+ in grade 11, but \~80% average in grade 12.

Truth be told, you should always do things early, regardless of what it may be, as it typically gives you a much larger advantage than those who apply later.",comment,1
