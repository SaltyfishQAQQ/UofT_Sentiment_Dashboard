Just look at the Subject Ranking for UofT, and for all of the other universities. Toronto had nearly twice the programs that caltech does for example. If you combine all the students and staff from the other universities, you still have less people in total than UofT has students. Hell, UofT has more *staff* than caltech has students.

Net result is that the university has a huge number of professors putting out research, which propels it higher up in the rankings.

The thing to remember is that this is not the list of most fun schools, or the list of most employable schools. This is the list of research schools, and as a research school UofT is genuinely world class.

Another caveat with UofT, because it has so many students they don't really worry about ensuring everyone passes. As a result they keep the academic programs fairly aggressive, with the understanding that people that can't handle the load have many other options to fall back to. In other words, being high on this list doesn't mean your student experience will be great.",comment,29

(The ""academic staff"" count is not perfect because it must be that different have different standards for who they mean by ""academic staff"" -- e.g., unclear if you count lecturers, unclear if you count people who are mainly scientists in hospitals, etc. The ""doctoral degrees awarded"" count is probably solid in terms of the fact that you compare like to like, but it's not completely fair to just think that larger schools are automatically rewarded, since a lot of the time you need external funding in order to pay PhD students, and external funding is obtained on a competitive basis)

If we look at faculty rankings, Waterloo is one of the top ones when it comes down to math, engineering. However, UofT generally has more faculties and they are all equally strong.

too big that the school lacks support for undergrad - U of T does not officially reveal the faculty to student ratio, but I would say it is pretty high among the top universities in the world.

obviously more focus on post grad students and researches because that's what gets it to high ranking in the world so less focus on undergrad 

unpopular opinions for Canadians but... it's not prestigious first of all.. ranking != prestige .. as an intl student prestige matters to me but I could not get over with students from the U.S. and U.K... especially in my country they cared more about the difficulty of admission into the school from high sch - it's quite easy to get into u of t 

in other words the name of the school does not get you to competitive jobs such as Investment Banking etc - not a target school for those firms. maybe I cared more about this since I wanted to break into those kinds of jobs

no networking culture since everyone is busy with academics",comment,1
