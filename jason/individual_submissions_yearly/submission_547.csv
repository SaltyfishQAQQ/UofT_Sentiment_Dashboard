And FYI, the Arab Palestinians started what was effectively a civil war by hijacking a bus and killing 5 in Jaffa, and shooting up the mamilla center in Jerusalem, following resolution 181. Benny Morris has the number who left during that war under 100,000, and that includes the 4.5 months of 1948 on top of the single month of war in 1947.

In May of 1948, the Arab states simply expanded the war that the Arab Palestinians started. And no, they didn't join to ""prevent the further elimination of the Palestinians"", they joined to try to finish what the Palestinians started: preventing the creation of Israel, and to push the Jews in to the sea. A fact they don't deny to this day, if you actually bothered to listen to them. 

The term ""al-Nakhba"" itself was coined by Constantin Zureik to describe the shame of the Arab failure at preventing the Jewish state and subsequent and resulting death of pan-Arabism, not the ejection of Arabs as a result of a war they themselves started. Nothing's changed. The main gripe people have about Israel is the fact that it exists. Not that it displaced or killed a certain amount of people, or treated people badly. Those are all just excuses that are used to undermine the legitimacy of one of the UNs longest standing member states. Because at the end of the day, Israel killed, displaced, and oppressed way less people over the course of its existence than any one of its neighbours over the same time frame.",comment,5

You realize the 1948 war was not some noble attempt to save the helpless Palestinians from Zionist terrorism, right?

Again, The nakba began in 1947, when 300k Palestinians were already ethnically cleansed by groups like the Ingrun and the Haganah. How are you saying this was not the catalyst, or the start of the Nakba? 

You are perpetuating a lie that those ethnically cleansed during the nakba only happened because the Arab national armies spontaneously decided to enter Palestine because Israel declared itself a nation in 1948. Nearly half of those ethnically cleansed during the nakba happened before the state of Israel was declared, and before any outside arab nation stepped foot in Palestine. 

The Ingrun and Haganah became the IDF in 1948. There was at no point a cessation of violence, the name of the groups perpetuating the ethnic cleansing simply changed.

And because I know you will most likely bring up the point. ""If the Palestinians would have just accepted partition, there would have been no war"", here are some quotes that prove otherwise.

>*‚Äú\[I am\] satisfied with part of the country, but on the basis of the assumption that after we build up a strong force following the establishment of the state‚Äìwe will abolish the partition of the country and we will expand to the whole Land of Israel.‚Äù*

>‚Äú*I don‚Äôt regard a state in part of Palestine as the final aim of Zionism, but as a mean toward that aim.*‚Äù

These are Quotes from Ben Gurion, the primary national founder and first prime minister of Israel. These quotes show the intention behind the zionist forces back in the 40s, and even explain how they operate today.",comment,4

I absolutely agree with you that Jewish Terrorism played a part in what became the Nakba, but it did not cause the Nakba. 

As for Ben-Gurion, the man was a Nationalist who wanted to provide a safe country for his people. Would I have liked him today? No, probably not. I would not have liked him back then either, but that does not mean one voice speaks for a Nation, founding fathers are often abrasive.

And lastly, the Nakba ‚Äúbegan‚Äù in 1947 according to the Palestinian perspective, which is valuable and worth respecting. The back and forth of terrorism resulted in estimates of around 100 000 Palestinians fleeing between 1947 and mid 1948. 

When the Mandate ended and Israel declared itself sovereign, it was immediately attacked. This alone would be a pretty solid motivation for a man who knew  that Jews would always be a minority if there was a one state solution.

We can point at quote after quote regarding intention to annihilated one state or the other. Historically it has been Israel who extends the olive branch, not without their numerous flaws, but an effort is made. Unfortunately, there is more effort put toward historical revisionism and pretending that the conflict is one sided than there is an effort to work together and develop as neighbour‚Äôs.

Side note, I 100% include settlers, as well as the extremely disappointing failure to punish abuses caused by them as having a responsibility in the continued crisis.

We were the closest we have ever been with Arafat, and he has public comments saying that he feared for his life if he made Peace with Israel because of the hard liner majority in Palestine.

Jewish Terrorism was a response to Arabic Terrorism, and vis versa, this can go back thousands of years. It did not cause the Nakba, the Nakba was a culmination of repeated attempts to destroy and quarantine Israel before it could exist as well as the very valid role Jewish terrorism played in exacerbating tensions (I mean valid as in it is also responsible, not that it is justified). It would be extremely naive to believe that the state of Israel has not grown since the 1940‚Äôs and continues to operate under the same philosophy. 

A nation evolves, Palestine seems to want to be stuck in history to rewrite the Nakba. It is very early in the morning so I apologize for any rambling.",comment,1
