Yes, a ceasefire that they made the terms for and agreed for, not a one that was even negotiated with Israel. Hamas doesn't get to make demands, they are losing. 

>  Israel [attacked Rafah after the ICC ruling](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-rafah.html)

irrelevant because the ruling doesn't say they can't attack Rafah, it says they can't commit acts of genocide in Rafah which is fine because they aren't.

> Also important to note that, as shitty as Hamas is, they're a part of the ICC jurisdiction.

That's also wrong, the PA is party to the ICC, Hamas isn't since they aren't the legal representative of the Palestinians(although we all know Palestinians support Hamas and their goal but that's not relevant here)

> Palestinian leaders are in the same legal organization as Canada - Israel is the rogue state refusing to agree to international justice.

Nope, no country has an obligation to join the ICC, there are 193 countries in the UN and only 124 in the ICC, does that mean 35% of the world are rouge states? 

> You don't get to commit war crimes and use ""defeat the enemy"" as an excuse for it. You are seriously not understanding the political consequences or meaning of breaking international laws.
