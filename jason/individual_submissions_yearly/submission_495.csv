What to study if I want to understand EVERYTHING?,deleted,1g3u30s,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1g3u30s/what_to_study_if_i_want_to_understand_everything/,1728948993.0,"Hey everyone,

A little about me - I graduated with a double specialist in Political Science and philosophy a number of years back, then went off to law school, then practiced for a handful years. 

I'm now in financial position where I can take my foot of the gas for a bit and not work for the next few years...and I want to go back to school to really explore my interests, which I didnt get to do the first time around due to the pressures of overbearing first generation immigrant parents, the struggle to consistently bring home good grades or face verbal and/or physical abuse, and general poverty. 

I really want to learn the basics of virtually ALL stem fields. I was kind of leaning towards some sort of engineering, since I've heard that the eng ciricullum really teaches its students how to learn ANYTHING. But I have also done some thinking on other fields:

1. It seems like alot of computing is just really advanced Linear Algebra (I've stumbled through some research papers like ""Attention is all you need"" and this is the impression I got). So I def want a program with alot of linear albegra.

2. Astrophysics/Astronomy just seems to be alot of advanced geometry/topology. So I guess im also looking for a degree that involves this at a high level.

3. Chemistry? Biology? Physics? These fields are so broad...idk where to start.

Any suggestions for a degree program that generally encompasses the basics of the entriety of stem?

If they are really big no one will care that you aren’t actually in them. You’ll get a feel for how they are taught and whether you like them after a class or two. Tricky part is finding where/when each class is - I’m not at UofT (Reddit keeps recommending me other Canadian university subreddits) but my school only made this information private last year so.

Those are building blocks. I'm also a second degree student pursuing this out of a desire to understand things I didn't before. You'll never understand everything - that isn't a thing, especially because the more you learn, the more you learn about even more stuff you don't know. But just start with some building blocks and see where they lead you. And consider trying to structure it so you don't often take a class spot or a spot in a variable-minimum-grade major from a student who's trying to start a career not just pursue personal interests.",comment,5

They cover every engineering discipline, and the students are way ahead of the regular engineering program. You also get to specialize in what your interests are since it covers all engineering. To give an example, my former schoolmates ended up in medical school, architecture, law school, and aircraft industry.

I think physics is the most fundamental science, but chemistry and life sci would probably be more applicable.
There are joint specialist programs like chemical physics, math and physics, etc.
I chose not to do them to take more courses in physics.

If you find more of a passion for one STEM aspect over the other along the way, specialize in that one as it relates to robotics. For example, a biology passion, you can specialize in medical robotics.

I would try the career aptitude tests, aka career personality test. It suggests job titles that match your passions and personality. People happiest in their career path answer the same. Some universities offer this to alumni, then some tests online. 

I'm assuming after education, you'll want to make a difference in the world with a job title and/or starting your own company! It may say biologist or chemist for example, a clue to possible future directions in learning. Always fun to learn, better to find out early whether it's also fun to work in it. 

The next evolution of robotics like AI will free ourselves. A more free society is not only happier, three economists just won a nobel prize for attributing greater and sustainable economic growth to a free society.

They were surprised at this unexpected finding. They predict China will not continue growing as a superpower until their repressive government changes ([article](https://apnews.com/article/nobel-economics-prize-db3bfe55ac17dd22cf82f1dd637bfa94))",comment,1
