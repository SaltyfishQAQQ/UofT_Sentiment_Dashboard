I've taken a break from university for a while now, and I'm just getting back into it this semester as a part-time student. 



A few weeks ago, I had an appointment with my psychologist. When I told her about my lifelong insecurity over my intelligence and how I think I'm stupid, she really talked me up, and she told me that she actually thinks I'm gifted! My psychologist administers and evaluates IQ tests and studies intelligence, so when I heard her say this, I wanted to squee lmao. Nowadays I'm studying harder than I ever was, and although I'm still struggling, \*I'm working on it, and it's going to be okay\*. Ahhhh Dr \[NAME REDACTED\] you've turned my life around :')",submission,297

Itâ€™s a fairly common occurrence in neurodivergent (and similar) communities to be both gifted in certain areas of intelligence, and struggle in others. 

Definitely helps to validate and understand conflicting feelings and experiences you might have had. It just means you may need/benefit from support in certain areas. These days (compared to 10+y ago), there is more awareness and you should def take advantage of any student accommodations you can (e.g extended time).",comment,1
