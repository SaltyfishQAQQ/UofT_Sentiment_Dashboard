also a lot of people misunderstand the goal of protests (divestment) and think that a university is a misplaced target, but protestors actually have specific goals/action items! and of course there are just people who are plain islamophobic and/or hateful.",comment,100

One side is offering proposals in bad faith saying you need to meet all our demands and we will stop bombing you for two weeks. 


The other side has said they want a lasting ceasefire. 


They also haven't rejected a two state solution. This isn't even a point Israel is pretending to use anymore. Netanyahu is openly bragging in every opportunity he gets about how he has made sure to never allow a two state solution. 


Mark Regev, the Israeli spokesperson, when asked if they would consider a two state solution told BBC openly that they have never considered a two state solution in the past. The only offer they have made has been for something lesser than a stage. 


So why pretend to use a talking point when even the official Israeli government has said it's not true? ",comment,6

No they haven't said this many times. It was said once by one spokes person.


However many different Israeli politicians have said many times on how noone in Gaza is innocent and they should all be killed and starved and kicked out and are also actively doing it. 


Hell, Netanyahu just said even if Hamas agrees to a ceasefire he will still bomb Rafah. So clearly that's the side trying to propose a ceasefire right?


> The reason there’s no peace and won’t be peace is because there is no reliable peace partner for Israel.


Gee, and why is there no peace partner? Is it because Israel literally arrests or kills all Palestinian political activists? 


They specifically target moderates for that very reason. 


> The current sentiment is that a two state solution would only make the Palestinian stare a hotbed for terrorism in the region.


I love how Israeli apologists start from a position of 'there is no peace because the other side doesn't want a two state solution' and with even the gentlest push, their position of 'of course there can't be a two state solution with those terrorist animals' comes out immediately.


Honestly, I'm going to stop arguing here. The propaganda points you're putting forward are stale and stopped working months ago. Nobody is buying them anymore and they will only now work on extreme racists and islamaphobes who have already bought in to the dehumanization of brown people.
