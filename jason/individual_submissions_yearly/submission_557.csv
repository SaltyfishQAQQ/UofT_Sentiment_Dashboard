The economy in Canada is recovering, and iirc the job market growth has actually exceeded pre COVID times in the last few months, it’s just not recovering fast enough despite this. The problem is that the number of people who need jobs have grown faster than there are new jobs for them, which means even though we have more new jobs, it’s still not enough.",comment,31

That being said, you only have 40ish minutes once you’re in, so for next time you have to make a plan on where you want to go.",comment,3

I only lined up about 15 minutes before going in. It was so loud and hard to talk inside though and the 45 minute timer sucked.,comment,1
