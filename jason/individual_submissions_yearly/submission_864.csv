"Getting a D in first year chemistry, will this affect my chances of becoming a zoologist?",Zomkit,1h5sq3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1h5sq3j/getting_a_d_in_first_year_chemistry_will_this/,1733246643.0,"I'm really worried about my GPA, I'm on the verge of failing chm135, but otherwise I'm doing decent in my biology classes. How selective is grad school about GPA? Especially first-year classes.",submission,18

So long as you've learned stronger study strategies that work for you, it should pay off in the coming years.",comment,25

Many grad programs look at only the last 2-3 years, meaning 1st year is often ignored. If you can do better in your last few years, you'll be fine.",comment,6

I finished chm110 with a 53 but I needed a 65 for my program so I retook it, finished with an 86. Then got into my program (forensic chemistry which is ironic) and now I'm a masters student doing biomedical engineering. Anything is possible. Most grad schools really only care about your last 2 years anyways so just make sure your grades go up from here :)",comment,4

I failed first year chem and got into grad school at UofT EEB (previously the zoology dept. many years ago).,comment,3

As everyone else has mentioned - first year courses are often the worst (grade-wise) for many people.
And also nobody ever takes them into consideration when it comes to graduate school, so you are good.",comment,1
