Advice pls: for the love of god I just want to graduate ,Gluhworm,1hs053v,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1hs053v/advice_pls_for_the_love_of_god_i_just_want_to/,1735841461.0,"I’m in my 4th year of undergrad with just one more semester to go before I can graduate. I have completed my major, and am on track to complete one of my minors, but my second minor (HPS) is giving me a little trouble. 

I just need to add one more course in HPS to finish that minor and graduate. I need this particular HPS course because it not only completes my minor, but also fulfils my final breadth requirement (two birds one stone type of situation here). 

Anyways, I have been on the waitlist for this course for over a month, and in that time have dropped from #20 to #14 on the list. I’m worried that space won’t become available as quickly as I need it, to allow me to transfer into this course at the beginning of the semester. 

My question for you all is a), should I just thug it out on the waitlist? Or perhaps b), message the prof and beg to be added? What is the proper procedure here? I don’t want to screw over anyone else who is also patiently waiting for this course. Many thanks. ",submission,18

Technically, I only need to take 4 classes this semester. If I can’t take this class, I could pick out another HPS course and a different class for my breadth requirement (like in ESS or AST) and have a full course load. It’s not ideal because the courses that cohere with my schedule are mostly 2nd year classes (with 9 am tutorials :/ ). I can do it if needed, but if there’s another route I’d like to take it.",comment,6

in the meantime maybe you can stay on the waitlist and enroll in backup courses?",comment,1

I’m just wondering about who is in charge of enrolment and waitlist requests logistically. Does anyone know?
