How likely is it to get a research position with low gpa/resources for opportunities,Electronic_Mind9464,1gfds40,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1gfds40/how_likely_is_it_to_get_a_research_position_with/,1730259876.0,My gpa was meh first year but second year ece is eating me alive and its going to tank really bad. I told myself I'd try to find research positions this year but with my marks going so bad than they already are it feels really intimidating to email professors and feels pointless to apply for outside research positions that want a transcript. Are there other effective ways to get some sort of research experiences besides emailing professors? ,submission,23

I personally suggest to enroll in a research program monitored by other individuals like UTEA or so. I typically receive one positive response from 100.",comment,2
