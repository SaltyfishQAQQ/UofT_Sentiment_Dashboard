So, here am I thinking if all those students are  superb genius or am I dumb or If I have OCD. Bcz I never left  exam room until the last min ,even if I am done I keep revising .There is no way I am ever 100% confident about my ans so I even utilize the last min of exam .
So, if your also someone who leave exam room way before time ,tell me the reason ",submission,31

If youâ€™re the type of person who doesnâ€™t want to do a masters or anything after uni and you just want to get a job with your degree while a 65 is still a pass, why put in the extra effort to get a 90 if you get the same degree for less effort. Obviously some people may truly just be fast or geniuses but generally it boils down to them not putting as much emphasis on their grades as you do, Iâ€™d also bet the people ending super early didnâ€™t show up to many lecture or probably didnâ€™t submit all their assignments either.",comment,37
