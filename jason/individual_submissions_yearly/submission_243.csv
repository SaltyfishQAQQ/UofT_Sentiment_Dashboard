I volunteered on a lot of political campaigns during the last economic slump when I couldn’t find a job. I was a really good volunteer and became friendly with the campaign staff, so they recommended me to a political candidate who needed an office manager. Long story short, one campaign job after another led me to another campaign job. Two years later I won my last campaign as a campaign manager, and was hired to work for the legislature. I also worked for a couple of agricultural trade associations afterwards (a heck of a diversion from French).

I’d say the most common way to enter policy/advocacy is to be an intern at a think tank, interest group, trade association, or for a legislator. Then start applying for a paid job at another policy/advocacy job somewhere else. Most people have second jobs while interning if they aren’t being subsidized by their family. A lot of interns I knew were bartenders before they got their permanent job.

Some people get these jobs from family connections alone, but it is not very common. 

The pay can suck until you get to a top level. The only people making six figures are lobbyists, trade association executive directors, and policy researchers focusing on niche issue areas. I spent a lot of years making $45,000 - $55,000 which led me to taking the jump and working in fashion.",comment,1
