Asking for a coffee chat with a TA after the class is done: Is it okay?,lovestudyinfinite,1dmfh8u,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1dmfh8u/asking_for_a_coffee_chat_with_a_ta_after_the/,1719122512.0,"Hi folks, I finished my last undergrad exam. Woohoo! My background is in business, and I will continue to do my master's at Uoft starting this fall. The program is course-based but still offers research opportunities, which I would love to explore. I have not had any RA/TA experience so far due to limited time, but I wanted to do them during my grad school.

So I met a TA this summer who also happened to be the TA in my second-year courses, so just out of curiosity, I looked them up on LinkedIn. They have impressive research experiences, and even though they do research in different fields, I am very curious about their story—like how they planned out their academic career, found research topics, their internship experiences, skill sets, etc.

I would like to send out an email and invite them for a coffee chat. Still, I have never asked anyone in academia (except for asking for a reference letter from my favourite professor), and I'm wondering if this is a normal thing to do. I did go to their virtual office hours sometimes, so maybe they will recognize my name on zoom?Another concern is that since they are marking my final exam, maybe I should wait until the final grades are out? Will they feel weird if I am from a different specialist? The reason that I'm not reaching out to the TAs I met in my field is that 99% of them are not pursuing a PhD, and most of PhD in my field at UofT did their master's research elsewhere (internationally)

I know that they are not obligated to answer, and their research probably already takes a lot of their time, so I'm a bit hesitant. Would someone be able to give me some advice?

EDIT: Thanks for all the great advice — about staying professional, setting boundaries, choosing the right time and space, etc. Also when I say coffee chat, I mean a form of networking; it doesn't have to involve actual coffee (I don't even get coffee 99% of the time; I like my matcha much better lol).

You are showing your eagerness to be part of the field and you would like some insight from someone senior, especially when they are no longer your TA after the class.

leave a lasting impression on the TA and what if they need a student to help with their project? Never hurt to try!",comment,87

I did this a bunch with my previous students and I still keep in contact with some, and even became good friends with a few. I personally loved it when the students mixed our coffee chat with academic+casual topics, instead of just asking questions off a list.

You can wait until your final marks are out, but TAs generally have no idea when your final grades are released. It's probably safe to reach out like a week after your exam.",comment,14

I'm a TA and am more than happy to talk to students about career advice and grad school. It's more or less my job to aid them in their education and help them achieve their goals.

If you're going to ask to speak to them, I'd just make sure to set clear professional boundaries and avoid coming off as sycophantic or groveling. As you said, they're still responsible for your grades and you want to avoid a conflict of interest. Just treat it as a casual, but purely professional, meeting and you can totally take advantage of the TA's experience in the field.

Good luck!",comment,4

I haven't been a TA before, but I have had students reach out to me before on LinkedIn about my job/how I got there.

on the off chance that you're worried how this will be interpreted by your TA; just make sure you're professional, have relevant questions prepared (bring smth to take notes on/refer to your questions) and ask where *they* would be most comfortable meeting, like a coffeehouse near their lab or even the lobby of their research building.",comment,2

I TA'd Rotman for 5 years, continued as a side hustle after I graduated my masters- in a different field altogether. 

I would definitely wait until you get your final grades released and then I think it's fine to reach out. Try to have some questions and things you want to discuss in your note reaching out rather than just wanting to chat. I'd also recommend giving them the option of a virtual or in person meetup and if in person, they to suggest somewhere on campus. 

The key I would say is making it clear you're looking for their opinion, to hear about their experience, reco's etc. That way it can't be mis-construed as just another student reaching out hoping you'll just hook them up with a job or research opp. That happens soooo often, so I would say it's just important you make your intentions clear.

I assure you, you would not be the first person to propose meeting up for a stated purpose while all the while hoping for sex (or a prelude relationship to sex).

This is not to say this is your intent. I trust you it is not. But this is a far cry from the weird call out you are acting like it is. As someone who has been in teaching/mentoring positions often, I have been on the other side of this and am constantly guarded against the potential that the individuals wanting follow up/one on ones/coffee may very well have ulterior motives.",comment,2
