-

- MAT186 - can be challenging, personally this is the course I recommend studying ""ahead"" for because it'll pay the most dividends later on in calc 2 & calc 3 (the fundamentals of calculus remain the same, so if you're strong in those then you'll be set)
- APS110 - definitely the most chill course, you can easily get by using TopHat and Scott Ramsay's lecturettes on youtube
- APS111 - in general expect to do a lot of writing, how well your experience is in this course will depend a large part on your assigned team (not really anything you can do about that, it is what it is)
- MAT188 - not too challenging nor too easy, highly recommend using 3b1b's videos on youtube to build intuition
- CIV100 - i get that this is perceived as difficult (and it's definitely not trivial) but if you understand the core concepts and do enough practice of previous midterms/exams then you should be absolutely fine (the prof gives a very generous curve up at the end of the course which largely counterbalances the sheer difficulty of the midterm/exam)
- APS100 - just a chill time for relaxing with your peers and an upper year, any and all assignments/assessments are practically free marks, do not spend any amount of time doing work/studying beyond the minimum because the course is just pass/fail (there is high pass which is absolutely no different from pass beyond the addition of a single letter on your transcript)

General tips:
-

- don't be afraid of skipping lectures and studying content by yourself so you don't have to sit through 3-4h of lectures (ofc if you do skip then make sure you actually make up that time and learn; catching up is not at all easy and the more work you let stockpile the worse it will get)
- do make time for yourself, for friends & family, and for taking part in things like clubs, part-time work, hobbies, etc. there is more to life than the uni grind",comment,17
