Quite a few of them asked me how my exams went whenever after the exams in person and I thought they were interested in me but now I've been disappointed realizing I was just a 'ruler/measure' to check the course grade cap. I've disappointed towards myself and themselves and felt I've been useless

I would not have never felt bad if they just ghosted me and had no zeal towards their research

After putting efforts on them, most of them were friendly when I asked their insights and talked academics (they were interested in my insight as well), I was delightful thinking I'm learning from them and going further not just on the course material but the insight and their strength they have behind.

Most of them encouraged me in person, at that time, and now I'm realizing they, in fact, were indifferent.

I'm just losing my patience and doubting the worth and thinking what I have done till now.

I don't have strength to weep or scream till l get my voice lost in somewhere anymore.

Edit: Yeah, I've been doing this from the time when I joined this university and they (profs) advised me to take ROP first to see if I have strength to help their research, so that they could decide whether I can have an opportunity for a volunteer position. Due to the number of transfer credits i had which was used to get into this university I had to do this informal inquiries. I had 7.5 transfer credits, and I had to compete with students after taking courses here to get into POSt, and I did, got into POSt. But now I can't even take ROPs after establishing the requirements and taking upper year courses with nice letter grades.

So I asked the department that if they can waive the credit requirement so that I can take ROP (I can't even apply ROP when I exceed and/or reach 13.5 credits until this winter), given that I should have taken mandatory courses to get into POSt and should had time to be competitive enough to get accepted to ROP.

Then I got ghosted from the department and after visiting the FAS department in person they just advised me to tell profs to ask the research opportunity informally.

What makes me think this unfair is that I didnt even have an opportunity to take ROP and prove myself I'm competitive enough for research environment at the volunteer levelðŸ˜”",submission,86

You could then try to reach the prof through this connection. Iâ€™ve been told by my PI that CCâ€™ing a student from their lab, increases the chances of an email being noticed.

It takes a lot of work and days of just customizing emails to each one of them about research interests and how it relates to their work. Donâ€™t lose hope!

I also believe that people are starting to fill research positions earlier and earlier every year. I started sending emails during reading week in February and many of the profs I got return emails from said that they thought I was a good candidate but it was too late as the paid positions are already full, so got offered a lot of volunteer positions instead. I think if youâ€™re looking for a summer position you may need to start reaching out around January next year to have the edge. Also to avoid them asking for your grades, your CV and transcript should be attached to the email when asking if they have any research positions available. Saves the back and forth of them needing to ask you about your grades and gauge how good of a candidate you would be in their lab.",comment,5

* no need to include the last two points. if you attach your transcript, the profs will be able to see your grade. the last point about ROP just makes your email longer and frankly, i doubt profs care that you can't do ROP or that you're thinking of doing a second degree. a lot of them probably don't even know what ROP is. i would just leave it at ""i would like to discuss possible opportunities in your lab"" or something along those lines and not go off on a tangent.
* for the first four points, it depends on how you're writing it and how long you're elaborating each point. i would keep them concise, and limit it to 1 long-ish paragraph (\~5-6 sentences) or two separate paragraphs where in the first one, you express your interest and in the second one, you can talk a bit about your skills and experiences. do you have any other skills you got from your courses or experiences (i.e. specific coding languages, lab techniques, whatever other skills you might have from work or other experiences)?

the key here is to keep it very concise because profs quite literally get hundreds of emails a day. attach your transcript and resume (1 page, make it simple) so they can review your qualifications. i also do agree with emailing as many profs as you can because you're more likely to get a response if you cast a wider net, just make sure to customize each email a bit for every prof.

and honestly, even if someone's research doesn't interest you as much, i would recommend getting your foot in the door so you can later move onto the field you're more interested in (which is what i did! started with very menial work and now doing a project i'm super interested in). i totally understand the frustration because the competition here is fierce and profs are incredibly busy. but in my experience, if you keep trying and show your passion, someone will recognize it and give you a chance. best of luck!",comment,1

At the end of the day if your goal is grad school in the future, I wouldn't stress how you get the experience. It'll be 1-2 lines on your CV and something to talk about in future interviews.",comment,0

This is why you had to apply for 300+ diff labs with minimal answers. 

In my life, I've emailed ~10 labs from undergrad to masters to PhD. Only one didn't respond at all, and only one other was an outright rejection because they didn't have room. 

All others at the very least acknowledged an application. My grades were not amazing - one apologetically said that they weren't high enough which was ironically probably the lowest rated among them. The rest either accepted me, interviewed me, or tried to help me in another way (lab was full, tried to help by including me in another way).",comment,2

As I'm already considering 2nd degree (I have no room to take ROP and the profs I contacted doesn't seem to express leniency to get into their lab - for volunteer position), how much disadvantage you think I will be receiving when it comes to graduate school admission? (Literally, I'm exceeding 5 years to graduate). Can you share how you got an opportunity to publish your papers? I've attended hackathons, datathons, and looked publication opportunities at this university but I had no luck on publication :(",comment,2

No one says, 'I completed one national paper', 'I completed one Toronto paper'. Also why would someone brag about a 'Toronto paper'. Do Toronto specific scientific journals exist? It would be embarrassing to have your work go to something so localized.

As for some advice, I agree with Ambitious-Figure. Targeted emails to PIs that's you've researched are alot better. You can also try reaching out to their students to learn about the lab and perhaps get an introduction that way. Remember that these people are super busy so don't get too discouraged. My previous PI would get postdoc/PhD/super student requests daily and take weeks to respond. I also do think it is a bit late for summer students. Usually we get emails for summer students starting in the Fall of the previous year.",comment,1

Once a lab has shown interest in you, it is very common to reach out to the current students. My current lab makes a point of having the more senior staff and students meet with the prospective students once they've passed the lab head interviews. In my eyes, that is more of a personality check i.e. ""will this person fit into the culture of our lab?"".",comment,3

Please heed this advice: do not apply without having contacted someone you're interested in working with and getting a positive response back. 

Unless you've got a very strong GPA, it is an absolute waste of time to blind apply. Worst case they reject you and you're out whatever the application fee is. Best case you're going somewhere with no knowledge of who you want to work with. 

By the time you are considering grad school, you should at the very least be capable of A) finding research that interests you, and B) reaching out to the person who published that work. You do not need to work on it for your whole life, but blind applying is absolutely and completely a fools game.",comment,1

I appreciate your advice but I can see your very narrow minded. 

I see youâ€™re doing your degrees in other countries

Unfortunately, I like to keep an open mind and luckily, I was able to get accepted into a graduate program and found a PI who was interested in me through this with a low gpa. So, I guess it wasnâ€™t a waste of an application fee! 

Thanks for the advice though but Iâ€™m going to keep taking the chances and opportunities life throws my way! :)",comment,1
