Might as well dilute your tears with some tequila then. You'll have a bunch of time to think about him on the reading week",comment,21

Donâ€™t try to fight it, accept the fact that the next few weeks will suck. Focus on your studies and take breaks to do what you need to in order to heal (sit there and think/cry, go outside for a walk, etc). I also recommend meditating at 10-minute intervals a few times during the day, and most importantly at night before bed to realize that the only thing that truly matters is that you are alive and breathing.",comment,5

There's also OISE's psychotherapy clinic. Your student insurance should cover up to $400 worth of therapy sessions.

EDIT: also, perhaps too late now, but you can submit up to 1 absence declaration per semester and be excused from deadlines/midterms (final exams are another matter), no questions asked. 

I know this is Reddit, but the lack of actionable advice here is just sad.",comment,2
