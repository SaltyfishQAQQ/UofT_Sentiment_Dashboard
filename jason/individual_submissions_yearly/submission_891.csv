I am entolled in 3 courses for the fall semester(Chem135,csc108,soc100). Any advice on how to not mess up after being absent for this time",submission,17

I would seriously considering deferring your start date so you can start things off the right way, but I’m sure you can catch up academically as long as you stay up to date on the readings if you’re already committed to doing things this way.",comment,19

I’ve never taken SOC100 but CHM135 and CSC108 are doable without going to class. in fact I barely went to class in my first year and I did pretty well. might be because I did IB though. most first year life sci classes are recorded so you’ll be fine. just make sure you don’t miss any deadlines or labs and if you’re going to miss a lab because of this then let the prof or whoever is in charge know.,comment,2

CSC starts off easy so you’ll be fine if there are. If there are no recordings for chem I think they give textbook readings that teach the same content as class. And I’m sure you learned the same chem stuff in high school.,comment,1

I saw someone post that you make most of your friends in the first couple weeks and not having this is huge. Have you considered deferring for a year?,comment,1

You’ll just lose some lab marks (maybe like 4% at most), but it definitely doesn’t mean you will fail the class. 
With csc108 - you will do all of it online (as you are required to do your weekly lectures and homework), I found my csc108 in-person lectures absolutely useless - by the end of my semester there was barely anyone attending, I was basically preparing for my other classes most of the times during my csc lectures, we would go over the exact same thing you did on your own prior to classes online. 
No idea about the last class you mentioned - I didn’t take it last year.",comment,1
