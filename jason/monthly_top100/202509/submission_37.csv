The Paper Towel Pilot and The need for Paper Towels,poopieuser909,1nonht9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nonht9/the_paper_towel_pilot_and_the_need_for_paper/,1758648070.0,"I am gonna keep this jovial but this is a genuine frustration with the Paper Towel Reduction Pilot by the Student Leadership Subcommittee of CECCS and the lack of paper towels in bathrooms. If you go on their page they have a breakdown of their justification on this decision, citing different arguments and papers on why hand dryers are better than paper towels, but there is one glaring Omission, what if I need to dry something other than my hands?

As someone with allergies and a constant stuffy nose, I prefer to flush my nose a few times a day so I can breath, this involves my face getting wet, guess what I cannot dry using a hand dryer? MY FACE . I have seen people also talk about cases where someone has a nose bleed, needs to blow their nose, ect, I can image a bunch of cases where someone may want a paper towel only to be hit with that evil sticker. I am not gonna get into the struggles of being someone with dry skin, but that is another factor of my issue.

I like to offer alternatives if I complain about something, so here is my, admittedly not well researched solution, place the limited electronic dispensers rather than the pull as many as you want ones. We've all encountered one of those dispensers, that while yes super frustrating to use, would still achieve the stated goal of reducing paper waste, since you will only get a few at a time. Additionally, I think there are way better things to focus on rathe than stripping students of their paper towels, mainly the insane waste that is introduced by keeping the lights on in empty rooms and lecture halls.

While we're on the climate kick, get rid of all the food trucks that are burning hydrocarbons and the vending machines that contain products that are *really* not biodegradable. Also, ban personal electronic devices on campus that are above a certain voltage (looking at you gaming laptop users). Furthermore, implement clothing guidelines or create a school uniform to dissuade fast fashion.

This is a perfect example of ridiculous climate initiatives that don't actually move the needle and give the illusion of progress. Let science students blow their nose and wipe the sweat off their heads so they can focus on studies and actually come up with something that can change the world.",comment,51

The truth is that the staff bathrooms likely will keep getting stocked as they were. 

If they wanted to go after waste have they considered the environmental damage of the ongoing construction they do, or maybe the fact that the uoft book store sells polyester clothing that are not only not biodegradable but are actively giving their students microplastic infections. Perchace they would wanna go after the waste of printing overpriced textbooks for their students. It would also be environmentally friendly to get rid of the urine stalagmites that can be found in most male bathrooms(sarcasm)

most places with public bathrooms recognise the need for paper towels, hence use the mentioned annoying dispensers, I would rather be forced to get one of those 99% recycled brown paper towels at a rate of 1 per minute then get none at all",comment,5

Not only is it icky, I understand that this is a personal thing and there are worse things to be icked out by at uoft bathrooms, but for me i know that the rag would be in an unusable state after one nose clear. This also doesnt solve the questions with regard to drying my face.

Ive seen some Mensa candidates comment ""just carry around your own paper towels"", but to that I will answer with the next logical question, how would you feel if in the name of the environment the faculty mandated you to carry your own toilet paper rolls. Not to mention this obviously makes the hassle of commuting even more a hassle, I understand that it's privileged to the max that I am complaining about a lack of paper towels so that I can dry my face.",comment,9

I work on a staff-only floor of Robarts and can confirm that no, we were subjected to no paper towels as well. I say ""were"" because we organized a campaign to all complain repeatedly through the feedback form about how paper towels are a basic amenity that should be provided to employees and this shouldn't be affected by student-led initiatives, and citing sanitary and other concerns as mentioned throughout this thread. Also notable that those smarmy-ass signs got defaced a couple of times, though needless to say I can't condone that. =)

  
Anyway, as of last week, our paper towel dispensers were refilled and the signs got taken down. So no, it was the same for us too. And there's definitely a divide between administration (who I'm sure DID think it was a good idea based on cost savings) and your run-of-the-mill staff. Sending solidarity!",comment,5

I'll go a step further in assuming that administration are actually in support of this initiative because it technically contributes to all the ""world's most sustainable university"" hype in the news. Also, I strongly suspect that ""will reduce cost"" was included somewhere in that presentation, which caused everyone's neurons to fire like a Canada Day fireworks show.

The funny part about all of your suggestions is that getting rid of these things would actually have a clear benefit to the environment. If saving the planet is *really* the priority, there are a lot more egregious things to cut than paper towels. For example (on top of the 7 we already mentioned), stop serving drinks in plastic containers at fundraising and gala events.

This is a far more sensible middle-of-the-road solution that improves the current situation without needlessly inconveniencing an overwhelming percentage of the population.",comment,4

I should've clarified that it is likely that the admin buildings are not gonna be included in this program since conveniently for them the student led pilot is unlikely to extend to their spaces. The same admins who likely approved this program in the first place since no one actually using those spaces were asked. This is one of those bonuses I suppose they get by being higher on the hierarchy. Alongside the the higher salary, reduced working hours and the hiding behind ""our phone lines are busy please leave a message"" to avoid having to respond to students",comment,1
