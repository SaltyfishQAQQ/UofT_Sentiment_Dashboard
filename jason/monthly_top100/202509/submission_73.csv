I'm in URB340 and I'm honestly panicking. I've been doing all the readings and a midterm worth a decent amount, but this feels like it all comes down to one high-pressure moment. Any upper-years have tips for getting through a course with a ridiculously heavy test? Or is this just 'welcome to UofT'?",submission,51

Basically it was split 60/40 and the one you did better one, he weighted 60%.

Best of luck! Just remember a grade doesnt define your value.",comment,13

They are humans and if everyone is upset, it’s likely they’ll work with you to change it. Not a guarantee, but very much worth a shot. Speaking up often helps a lot with professors.",comment,2
