I made a website that has every event happening on campus,Dchen_08,1n2f56q,http://www.saycamel.com,1756394367.0,"Hi guys, my name is David and I'm going into my third year this fall. Last year, I realized how hard it is to not miss out on some of the really cool events happening on campus, so I started a UofT student club, which with a team of 5 UofT students, made a website that compiles events from 100+ UofT websites and 750+ instagram accounts. We've made it look really nice and be mobile compatible, and have added some cool features like a recommendation system and one click add to calendar. 

If you're a club admin, we're adding a bunch of club features like making club accounts, tracking attendance, collecting attendance info (student IDs, emails, food preferences) and analytics. So if you're interested, please check our my comment and we'll reach out in the next couple of weeks when the club side is live :)
