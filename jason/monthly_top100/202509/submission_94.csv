Cancelling Lease Agreement because I withdrew from UofT,IntlStudent800,1npe2kc,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1npe2kc/cancelling_lease_agreement_because_i_withdrew/,1758725138.0,"I signed a lease agreement with Campus One for this year but due to personal reasons I had to withdraw from UofT and won't be coming to Canada this year. I have been emailing Campus One since August 18th about cancelling my lease but they kept postponing and said that they will review it etc. And yesterday they replied that since I signed a contract I have to pay for the full year?

But I haven't even landed in Canada didn't use any of their facilities even for a day and I'm not even a student in Canada no more. So how does it make sense to do this? Is there any way out of this? I clearly cannot afford to pay the full year fee when I'm not even in the country. I have medical proof as well but they aren't listening. What can I do in this situation?

I don't think im gonna find any other tenant to take over my lease at this point. I'm so lost can anyone please advise me on my situation?",submission,35

However, this responsibility is mitigated by the responsibility of Campus One to mitigate their losses through finding a replacement. Put simply, they cannot just sit on an empty unit for a year and charge you that rent, nor can they double dip by finding a replacement and charging you rent as well. In order to enforce a collection from you, they would be required to sue you and demonstrate with evidence they could not find a replacement for however many months. This is generally quite rare - from case law surrounding RTA tenancies, it is rare for the LTB to award more than two months of rent as it is reasonable to assume that a new tenant can be found within 2 months. Your matter, however, would likely be heard Small Claims Court rather than the Landlord and Tenant Board since the LTB is reserved for tenancies and not student residences in partnership with universities.

Practically speaking as others have said, there is no reasonable way for them to enforce payment on your end. If you don't live in Canada let alone Ontario, there is no way for them to sue you because they have no way of serving you the appropriate documents required. They also have no way of garnishment or asset seizure without a court judgement which again requires you to be served.",comment,14

It's like a contract only under the RTA. You're breaching this contract. This makes you legally obligated whether you show up or not. That's why they're mentioning the year obligation.

You have to formally end things with form N9, tenant's notice to terminate a lease. You can put today's date. They then have to mitigate losses by relisting it for rent and make an effort to find someone else. Until then, you owe the monthly rent.

A faster way is to ask for permission to find another tenant. If they refuse, you only owe the next 30 days in rent.

[LTB brochure how a tenant can end their tenancy](https://tribunalsontario.ca/documents/ltb/Brochures/How%20a%20Tenant%20Can%20End%20Their%20Tenancy%20(EN).html)

I'd make these requests business formal. Don't mention any personal reasons you're ending the lease like medical. It's not relevant other than garnering sympathy from a landlord. You're not going to get that from a company. It's why I suggested N9 vs including all the details in an email.  I also think they're dancing not replying to you since this happens with companies. Why hurry when they're busy at the start of term. They can just say you were asking questions, not formally ending the lease.

For going after you for back rent owed, they can depending on the relationship between your country and Canada. They file a claim at LTB, get an order to pay. If you don't by the deadline, they'll pay $100 in small claims court, get a judgement. If it's worth their while financially, they work with a lawyer in your country to collect. If not, they wait until you return to Canada. This may impact your PR or study permit approval, not sure. It will impact your credit score for sure which is needed in the GTA for any private rental.

Good luck, remember to keep all communication formal going forward. No questions.

I have already replied but wanted to add some thoughts.

\- I would be tempted to back date the N9 instead of putting today's date. In the body of the email say, as per my email on this date \*\*\*\* , I indicated I will not be attending this school term. Please find attached an N9 for termination of my lease. Please respond you have received this.

\- What people do with other rentals here in Ontario, they check if the landlord has relisted the place for rent. With campus one, I imagine it's on the off-campus UofT housing page. It helps to show if they are making an effort or not to find another student to mitigate losses. They may be lazy about this being busy in Sept helping students get settled. Some landlords hope a tenant doesn't know our housing laws. For them to say a year owed, that's intimidation and hoping you are unaware.

When a claim is made to LTB (landlord and tenant board) for back rent owed, you have a chance to speak to a justice of the peace mentioning this lack of effort to mitigate rental losses. It's done over zoom. The latest I heard was a 6 month backlog but the Ontario government has been working on improving that.

I think they may just refuse to have you find a tenant to assign this agreement aka lease to. Then it's 30 calendar days from when they refuse. Owing Sept + part of Oct from the date of your request. If they accept your request, most list on roomies, places4students, fb marketplace, kijiji and the UofT off-campus page (if possible).

They may also just not make a claim to LTB, they have a year to do this. I think they also have to issue you a N4 first to request back rent owed before making a LTB claim. You'll know if they are taking legal steps. It has a deadline in the N4 for you to pay. Many ignore it and wait until LTB hearing to plead their case. The LTB order can indicate a payment plan in the order which is often better for struggling students but normally done to avoid eviction.

good luck!

edit: you may want to look up what the students did during covid. Campus One still insisted they pay rent even though they weren't on-campus. They challenged it being unfair, not sure how it ended up. Also check all the current laws, I may be wrong about some of the above!",comment,2

In Canada CR uses address + markers if they have them, primarily SIN numbers. They don’t correlate to any foreign info, like in the US where they use SSN number. There is literally no way to match these unless they are provided them by you. 

The key is, you should never ever share foreign info because they don’t transfer any credit benefit what so ever. Also, they cannot demand it. (Technically they can’t demand your sin number, even though most give it as we ‘want’ domestic credit). 

But again, even if you had spectacular credit info your home country, it won’t impact your credit here, so never ever give it to anyone except a government agency which legally can’t share it without consent. 

So no, even with the US they don’t share credit info if they don’t have any link(as in, you didn’t give them your SSN- or UK or China or Any other country). 

They try to make people think they do as it benefits creditors. But unless there is a court judgement against you, and then the company seeks funds in your home counties courts, and then wins a lien or judgement there, you won’t have any credit damage. 

How do I know? I have credit reports in 4 different countries that I have lived in, and about 10 years ago I cancelled a Credit card in Canada that had a recurring charge that was  continuously executed after the cancellation that I was not aware of (or aware it was possible, but Canada is fucked on consumer protections). So I had to spend a few years dealing with that, and they insisted if I didn’t sort it out they would damage my credit in the US. 

So I saw a lawyer, and I found out that it was a very common lie that was near impossible to happen unless I gave them my foreign account info. So never did, and as I learned more about credit agencies I learned they are big liars and easy to fight legally to expunge any BS with a few days of letter writing. 

So seriously don’t worry about that. However, if anyone co-signed the lease or guaranteed it, if they have Canadian credit, or funds they could suffer from a judgement, mind you getting funds from a judgement in Canada is also hard to do, but it would destroy their credit indefinitely. 

Another concern could be the University, if they sorted the lease for you that could make them the guarantor. Which you might want to check out, as that could be a huge problem for any future enrolment.",comment,7
