next class, try to find him before class starts and ask if you can sit right next to him. bring a snack that is shareable; during lecture, offer some to him. this sounds silly but it actually goes a long way (speaking from experience). very wholesome flirting at this point. try to chat a bit after class and exchange contact info. congrats! the hardest part is over. 


the next step is to invite him to something outside of class. could be studying together or if you're forward, just ask him to coffee or a museum. this is where you should be able to tell if there's an interest. if there's a vibe - he might be the one to ask you out directly. but guys at U of T are quite shy so maybe won't happen. 


at this point, you're sitting together in class every lecture now and hanging outside of class as well. if the vibe is there, then congrats you now have a husband. ",comment,72
