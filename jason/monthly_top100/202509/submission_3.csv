All U of T students can get a TPL card for free. Just ask for one at [any branch](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/hours-locations/) with the [required ID](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/your-library-card/identification.jsp) (like your student card and piece of mail with your name).

Card or no card, we’ve got your back.

**PERKS WITH A CARD**

**💰 Get required reading for $0**

Textbooks? No. But we do have other titles—in print and ebooks—that might be on your syllabus and great sources for papers. Plus, we have test prep books (e.g., LSAT). [Search our catalogue](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/blank-search.jsp).

**🤓 Use our databases for papers**

Tap into peer-reviewed sources from JSTOR and other databases. Also, access Toronto Star and Globe & Mail archives—you can even get a paywall pass for NYTimes.com. [See all databases](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/databases/).

Take thousands of self-led premium online courses on tech, business, creative and professional certification topics. Without a library card: $35/month. With a library card: $0. [Access via TPL](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/detail.jsp?Entt=RDMEDB0187&R=EDB0187).

**🎤 Create what you need in our studios**

Work on creative assignments in our Audio Visual Studios. Besides recording equipment, we have nifty gadgets like 3D printers, sewing machines and a vinyl cutter. [Browse tech-y services](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/using-the-library/computer-services/innovation-spaces/).

We help everyone, including post-secondary students. If you need some extra help finding sources, searching like a pro or completing other tasks, you can ask us for help. [Book a librarian](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/book-a-librarian/).

🎟️ **Borrow free tickets to museums**

Not related to academics, but anyone with a library card can get free passes to 20+ cultural experiences—from the Aga Khan Museum to the Zoo. [Explore available attractions](https://www.torontopubliclibrary.ca/map/).

We know, we know. You might not have time. But if you do, we’ve got you covered. Want our ebooks and audiobooks on your phone?

Excellent question--and it's something we're going to bring back to our Membership team, since it's such a useful point to guide our communications.

TCards for both St. George and UTSC are eligible since they both fall within Toronto and TPL's geographic service area. For TCards for UTM, getting a TPL wouldn't be possible since it's not located in Toronto (we'll double-check this and provide an update if that's not the case). But the good news is that UTM students would be eligible for a public library card from our friends over at Mississauga Public Library, which also offers free cards to anyone going to school in the city, regardless of where they live.",comment,2
