Im no covid freak but there are variants and flus going around, and gurl doesnt want to get sick. Wearing a mask isnt weird or anything, in fact thank you if you wear a mask.

also to that girl in class who was talking about how everyone was getting sick and said ""i'm getting so sick"" \*cough, cough\*, yeah it sucks that your sick but dont get other people sick. You can walk over to your dorm and take a nap or snuggle in blankets but some people over here dont want to stand for a one hour commute all feverish and snobby

this happens every year but dont forget how awful it feels to try to sleep with one nostril absolutely clogged and the other runny like niagara.",submission,246
