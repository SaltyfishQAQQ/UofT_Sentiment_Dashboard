In the teaching program there are practicums where experienced teachers would frequently observe the teacher candidates' teaching and evaluate them. And to move up on the salary grid after getting hired most teachers would take a Master as well. It takes a teacher about 6-8 years of post secondary education and 10 years of teaching to reach the top of the salary grid.
