I'm a 2nd-year Bioethics major / Environmental ethics major who just switched out from a non-heavy reading major. Currently, I'm assigned \~150(ish) pages to read per week (between all of my classes) - which, between UN bureaucratic BS on sustainability and 1700s philosopher talk, has certainly been a switch to say the least. 

  
I've recently had the chance to audit a 4th-year PHL class. Upon looking at the syllabus, readings range between 100 and 200 pages per week for *one course*. I presume some 4th years in English / philosophy are accustomed to 500+ pages per week of dense, 1700s philosopher pain. Not to mention, 3000+ word essays sprinkled in for fun. 

So my questions to all of you in these reading-heavy courses are: 

1. Am I wrong with my estimate? Am I auditing a sadistic, extraordinary course? I hope it's an outlier, but I wouldn't be surprised if I'm underestimating. 

2. How do you manage reading so much dense material in such a short period of time? Additionally, how do you incorporate long, thought-provoking essays into your time management? And, of course, needing to socialize, cook, and shower (ignore that last part if you're a math + philosophy specialist - just kidding, unless...)- seems like all of these factors make it very difficult to actually get everything done in a timely manner. 

3. Finally, once you're done with reading all of that, how do you incorporate notes? I've been going through this phase where I feel the compulsive need to take hand-written notes on EVERYTHING (about a 1:3 ratio of notes per page). I sense that those of you reading 600 pages per week are not writing 200 pages worth of notes per week. Is there a type of note-taking that you swear by (or hate)? 

As a side question, do you personally enjoy the readings you're assigned, or are they the same-old hit-or-miss you receive in lower years? Would you feel you ""gain"" something significant out of them, aside from the sole purpose of ""doing it for class?""

Any other pieces of horror stories, advice, hacks, or pep-talks are greatly appreciated! Thank you so much for your support. ",submission,39

The readings didn't grow exponentially, and i remember doing roughly 400 pages per week for all my readings. But the difference is your ability to engage with the work. 


You have my sympathy, the whiplash from the tone of the heavy readings can be a lot! A couple of things that helped me, they may or may not help you but they might be worth a shot.


1. I had to schedule my time. I had no classes on Mondays for a few years, so Mondays became my reading days where I did the majority of my readings then, so I could focus on classes  and assignments like essays later in the week. But you might want to schedule an hour a day or something, whatever works better for you. 


2. The company secret is you do not have to do 100% of the readings. In law school, in PhD work, that is different. But for 2nd year if you get 80-90% done, depending on the course, that is plenty. 


3. Ask yourself what your goal is for the readings. Are they to remember details for exams, like in the sciences? Are they to find patterns and connect dots for an essay? Are they to find debating points for class discussion? Those can shape how you want to approach the readings, including how much you want to invest in them.


4. I did my reading in the library around other people. It at least got me out of the house and there is a veneer of accountability. 


5. 1:3 note ratio seems kind of heavy. Look through your notes from previous sessions from the start of class. Did you actually need all of those notes? Sometimes just writing the main point, a detail, and the page number from the reading is enough. 


It all really is practice, I wish it was easier but it does get easier as you get into the habit.",comment,14

This first read through is to give yourself a sense of the structure and flow of the piece (its form) while the second is when you go back through for a more careful inspection for its content. trying to do both types of reading at the same time is when people get frustrated and give up since they'll suffer through a few pages at most before stopping to scroll on their phone. 


Having a sense of the reading's form and ""gist"" even if it's not fleshed will tell you a lot about what the thesis of the piece is, and even if you don't have the time to do a second careful reading you can furnish yourself with a decent enough understanding of it (for a lot of simple readings this is usually enough). When you have a heavy reading load, the vast majority of your reading is going to be of this cursory sort, and for these lighter pieces you will likely only have to zero in on a few important passages to re read.


 You want to do a thorough enough reading that you can answer these questions: 


1) What is the reading about as a whole?
 2) What is being said in detail, and how? ( It's parts and how they relate to the whole)
3) Is the reading true, in whole or in part?
 4) What of it, or what are its implications?  




What happens with a lot of younger students is that their first reading of the piece is when they try and go sentence by sentence slowly, telling themself that they're confused, going back and re-reading, and just making no progress. You want to avoid this because having a sense of the whole of the reading (it's main point) and the relation of the parts (it's key arguments, sub arguments and conclusions) will tell you more about the reading than trying to understand it on a line-by-line basis on your first reading",comment,7

I was averaging EASILY 1000 pages or more a week BECAUSE the syllabus is the root, foundation material, but you are not counting all of the secondary source research you undertake for assignments. 

And i was a history minor as well which added a couple hundred

Its an extraordinary amount of reading.

How did I do it? You’re just always reading - you learn to read super fast and to focus only on parts that provide insight or key material",comment,3

As for studying and remembering the readings (most of my exams/tests are open essays) it takes a little longer initially but pays off for me personally: 

While I’m doing the readings, I have a doc open where when I come across a point I feel is important to remember, I write a simple test style question (I.e. what was Hobbes’ idea about the state of nature? Or “what was the purpose of x anecdote) and then answer it in point form - I usually aim for 7-15 solid questions per reading that go into the key points needed to understand the reading 

Then in lecture, I make sure the questions and answers I wrote were accurate and add any main points I didn’t catch 

Closer the exam, I’ll make a copy of the doc and delete the answers, and try to answer the questions myself 

This helps me review if I know the important content and things I can bring up as support in any exam argument without having to re read the papers again - I’ve found this has been best for me  but ofc it varies for everyone :)",comment,2

I suppose I went in with the premise of ""handwriting notes = retention = I will remember stuff on the test"" but you have a very good point in that sometimes overcramming notes has a diminishing return. What would you suggest is a more practical note-taking strategy that worked for you during long readings? Would you suggest, instead of taking many notes, refocusing that time on potentially re-reading (I would personally not trust myself to re-read haha). 

Also, thanks for the advice on 80-90% - I feel I understand a lot of the ""meat"" of an essay and what the author is trying to get at, however, the author makes a detour along the way of reaching their conclusion. That's relieving. 

I hear you on Mondays - I don't have class either. My question for you is: did you just set yourself a goal ""I will finish courses x, y, and z on Mondays"" or did you just go with the flow? Often, I find that on Mondays, I'll get through one course and then say ""cool. Time to get Gyubee."" 

Once again, thank you so much for your advice!",comment,3

Yeah I think that advice is very concurrent with much of what else was noted - that it's important to slow down, and try to not get discouraged if readings are tough. 

Thank you a lot for your advice - it's easy to think ""I don't understand, thus I'll just accept failure"" but knowing that this is part of the learning process is very encouraging. 

What I most liked about your response was ""what to ask myself while reading"" - I'm going to use them for my readings tonight! 

Once again a big thank you!",comment,1

That seems pretty consistent with everything else that's being noted. As rudimentary as it sounds... prima facie (thanks PHL271) ""learning how to read"" is absolutely an overlooked skill that I think I'm going to read into (no pun intended).

From one bioethicist to another that's really great advice - I've heard of other people using this strategy, but I initially wrote it off as ""time consuming."" But I think that you touch upon something critical here - which is juicing the effectiveness of note-taking. I'll definitely incorporate that in my note-taking adventure. 

I have a quick follow-up for you. Have there been instances where you write down your questions, but the exam throws a complete curveball at you, in which the effectiveness of your questions is nullified? Or would you say that even thinking of these questions beforehand allows you to refine your reading and understand general, important concepts so that if the test asks a funny question, you can pivot to a broader point? 

Another follow-up: do you solely ask questions or do you take general notes as well?",comment,1

I personally structured it in time blocking, studying for 25 minutes and a 5 minute break. If I did it by readings I would be overwhelmed, but I knew I could do 25 minutes of reading (plus 25 more, etc), breaking for lunch for an hour, then diving back in. 


I would usually end up with them being done in a 9-5 session at the library. It left the rest of the week for essay research and supplementary stuff which were a lot but I knew what I needed from the materials. 


The comment below about Adler's book is a good one about how to get the most out of readings. There is also a small section at robarts with books on studying (do a quick search in the library system) and they were helpful with some practical structure.


My last piece of advice is to have an extra postit note or paper available for when authors go on tangents that are interesting but not what you need. Just jot down the author, page, and topic. If it is still interesting and you have downtime, dive in!",comment,3

It honestly may feel time consuming while you’re doing it especially for longer readings, but in the end, it’s worth it when you have a good, condensed yet detailed outline of each paper 

With regards to your first question, I haven’t found the that it has been obsolete for any essay based exam I’ve written. I gear the questions I ask not to anticipate what might be on the exam, but rather to be able to thoroughly reference any reading in any question. Since many philosophy  exam questions are something along the lines of explain As argument, explain Bs argument, and then some critical analysis of your own, this way of note taking helps to have a solid understanding of the arguments presented, and then from there, to be able to write a good critical analysis. I haven’t found phl exams to through ‘curveballs’ so long as you know each author and their argument - they may throw a more challenging and in depth question, but I’ve found those smooth to write since I’ve started studying this way 

I do still take notes in class to ensure that I’m not missing any interpretation or side point the prof makes and then I’ll incorporate those notes into questions as well if there’s something the prof said that I completely missed!",comment,1

Thanks again for your follow-up. Especially that post-it part - often I see a particular section my professor says to not get bogged down in, but I just can't help myself! 

Back in my previous major, I used to pomodoro all the time, but I generally found that if I was reading a section with a time constraint, I'd find myself reading faster. Would you say that this happens with you? Or do you think generally stating ""I will read this one section in x minutes"" is also a good strategy? 

I spoke to my professor today on this exact topic and they noted those same resources at Robarts. I'm going to make sure to check them out - thanks so much!",comment,1
