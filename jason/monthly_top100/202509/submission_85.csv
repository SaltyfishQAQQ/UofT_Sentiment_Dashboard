UofT Intramural sports are an absolute joke how is back campus acceptable and what are these new rules?,Any-Lime-3406,1nmm0jn,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nmm0jn/uoft_intramural_sports_are_an_absolute_joke_how/,1758441226.0,"They changed the soccer rules to 50 minutes, rolling clock, no half time and the penalty area is a semi circle that’s 12 years in radius. 

They also set the field, which is just a carpet because it is designed for field hockey and not other sports, and last season 2 people on my soccer team tore their ACL. Bot to mention there were 18 reported concussions because of the concrete floor under the carpet of plastic grass on top. 

What the f is wrong with this school extracurricular activities. It is unsafe and grounds for a law suit for one, and for two it is not even actually soccer and I’m sure other sports have the same problem. ",submission,41

It can work if you know how to translate that into, say, health sciences, but for sports in and of itself I'm more confused than anything else.

At the end of the day, these facilities exist and should be usable by the student population when they aren't being used for the sports teams in question. Otherwise they're just collecting dust and the space would be better used for new classrooms and residences, which the St. George campus is in desperate need of.",comment,3
