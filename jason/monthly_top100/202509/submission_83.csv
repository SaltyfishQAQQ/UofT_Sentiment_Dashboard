I spent so much of my time always mediating how much time I spent being productive and my sleep time etc until I realized I had no real reason to say no to the fun things! A little sacrifice of your time to catch up on things a bit later is worth the uni experience :),comment,5

What’s been nagging at me silently has been the fear of regretting not saying hi and forming connections; I felt like a loser with nothing to say, but a lot of that type of thing is just in your head. There’s also understanding that there is a trade off of grades - socializing that varies from person to person. I’m not gonna beat myself up for genuinely being busy, but I’m going to try to push myself to talk to more people because there’s really no harm in doing so. I wish u the best, and I hope I do alright :)",comment,3

For me, talking to people in tutorials and labs and forming group chats with several others is what i found works. It starts with school stuff which is natural, then casual convos happen, then you look for things to do that’s still school related, ask if any of them share a class with you and form group chats from there, after a while, it gets to a point where some of you will gel and will want to hang out and go out to things",comment,1

Maybe start small. Challenge yourself to dedicate just one hour a week to something social. Hart House has tons of free programming. Things like Get Crafty, the Weekly Social Stop, and other drop-ins. They also offer lots of other free programming for U of T students throughout the year. Low pressure, fun, and a great way to feel like you’re actually doing more than just library/dorm/repeat.",comment,1

I’m a PhD student who just came back to school after some time away, and I feel you! I’ve literally been one of two students studying in my department today!

I would highly suggest checking out some of the workshops on Folio, as they have some really helpful ones on things like time management, wellness breaks, sleep schedules, things like that.

When I did my undergrad (almost 20 years ago), I didn’t find “my people” right away. In fact, only one friend from my first year (we lived on the same floor in residence) really made it all the way through. It took time and patience, but it happens. And you’re not always going to find someone who fits with you doing things that you’re not into.

All that said, it’s really important not to burn yourself out! You can’t do that if you’re not taking breaks! I’m coming in for classes from far, so I come up Monday morning/afternoon (work on the train a bit), study for a couple of hours, and then meet up with some friends before my class. After class, I usually stop working for the night. Tuesday, I have no classes, so I’m typically working on campus from ~10:30 to 5:30, and maybe a bit more in the evening, but I generally take lunch right at 12, and even if I’m not hungry, I go outside and take a break from studying (with friends is great, but even if I’m alone, I stop working for a bit).

After lunch, I usually have a webinar sometime between 1-5. It’ll try and get up, walk around, and chat with people while I get a coffee. I get dinner on my way home (alone usually, but that’s partially because I’m burnt out at the end of the day). I might take a nap or do something social after that, and chill out before bed.

And Wednesday, I come in around 10, take a break around 12-12:30, grab a coffee, and head over to my 1pm class. After class, I like to chat with my classmates and then head to the train station. I don’t really work on the way home. Thursdays, although I’d typically prefer to sleep in late, my schedule hasn’t allowed that so far. I usually have a call around 10, then take a lunch break. Then a bit of work, workshop from 2-4 (BTW, even online, you can definitely make connections in these events!), brief break (try to take out my dog), and class at 5pm.

Fridays are my “off” days. I generally schedule all my personal stuff on Fridays, I have a swim practice, I talk to my therapist, I don’t look at work! Saturday is a good day for typing up my notes from the week (I hand write my notes and this is an awesome way to practice spaced recall), and Sunday, I will make sure everything is filed away properly from the week that just passed, download and print (as required) the material I need for this week, maybe start some reading (not often though!) and start again on Monday.

I do prioritize activities though! If there’s something I’m really interested in, I’m going to go out of my way to make it there, because you can’t just study, and finding people who share interests with you makes it more likely you’re going to find people who share your passions!",comment,1

At least once a week, throw on a fit, go drink with the homies, and talk to people. Eventually they’ll bring other people around, and those people will bring other people around, and by the end of it you’ll know a bunch of cool people. Later in life you’ll probably never regret how you did in one specific class, but I promise you’ll regret not socializing more and enjoying your veeeeeeeery short university experience.",comment,0
