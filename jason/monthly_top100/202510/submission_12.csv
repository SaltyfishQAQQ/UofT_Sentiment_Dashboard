[There’s a good ask science post about it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/s/QoAXbxj9wb) (pre-pandemic, those were the days…). Essentially, you’d need very high compliance for it to make a significant difference, and asymptomatic but still infectious individuals undermine its effectiveness. You’d need better than COVID-level masking compliance to make a difference in a common flu outbreak. We couldn’t get full compliance with an incredibly deadly pandemic; you’re not getting it for people who have colds. 

You’re like the sixth or seventh of these this month. Everyone gets all virtue-signalling in the responses about how it’s gross, but the reality is, at a population level, it will not change. Which is why I can only suggest that you take care of yourself:
  

1) Handwashing is proven to be effective at avoiding disease transmission, and you can do it to protect yourself without needing others to behave the way you want to. 

  
2) If you’re really that concerned, wear a properly fitted N95 mask during flu season. They are uncomfortable as hell, but they will stop you from inhaling viral particles. 

  
The only behaviour you can control is your own.",comment,3

That was just my first Google results, but every result that follows, from government of Canada, alberta health authority, NIH, etc. says basically the same thing. Yes, when you're sick you should definitely keep your germs away. But we can also protect ourselves from the germs of others pretty easily.
