No luck. 0 friends ever.

Ive made a few through the years and It’s highly program dependent
A lot  of the people I’ve met in person at school are a bit odd and lack social skills.

Networking is distinct from friendship because it's inherently transactional, and UofT is a networking school, through and through.

The people who seem to make the most genuine friends are those who feel most crippled by their programs. Engineering students, for example, bond over the insane amount of work they have, which only fellow engineering students really understand. Engineering is also great for friendship because of all the special programs and extra curricular activities geared towards engineers, specifically. It creates a sense of community which is difficult if not impossible to replicate in the giant pool that is The Faculty of Arts & Science. Furthermore, I don't think Engineering has the same problem as the rest of the university where there are less and less spots in 2nd, 3rd, and 4th year, though I might be wrong on this.

The size of classes and clubs, level of competition, and diminishing opportunities year after year make this place what it is. Everything done here feels borderline Darwinian in your ability to achieve success, be it in your studies or socially.",comment,2

There's Get Crafty! on Thursdays where you get together and make something new with others, The Weekly Social Stop on Tuesdays where you can get together and play videogames or build Lego, Queer and Trans drop-in monthly (if that's your community), and a bunch of free drop-in programming at the Fitness Centre in Hart House.

In earth sciences centre, there’s a mini forest inside it with a couple benches and tables. I’ll be hanging around in there tomorrow (Sept 29th) at 4:30pm, Wednesday (Oct 1st) at 1:30pm. 

Only condition is no excessive work or general school talk (unless it’s intro or something particularly interesting e.g implications of AI, or how the gender gap is institutionalised, or some cool coding project you’ve been working on). 

Some cool topics to discuss:

- what’s a passion project you’ve been up to? Could be serious, could be unserious. Could be big (an online store) or could be small (collecting coins)

- what’s something you’ve learned in class you find super interesting? Can be from any subject, but assume ppl don’t know anything about it. Talk about what it is, what it means, and why it’s cool.

- what’s something you’ve been learning about generally? E.g. cooking, skateboarding, archery, anything goes. Has it been as interesting as you expected? Harder? 

- any hot takes you have? Could be something super serious (there must be aliens) or super unserious (I hate matcha - this is true). What are hot takes you think are stupid?

- what’s a subject you know a lot in? Can be anything from history to chemistry to drawing to fashion. What’s something you wish other people knew about said subject? What’s some misconceptions people have about this subject?

- what’s something that’s been on your mind recently? An unanswered question, an annoying roommate, an idea you had",comment,7
