"I'm known as the ""smelly kid"" in my CS lecture, AMA",MoteChoonke,1o2lssv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1o2lssv/im_known_as_the_smelly_kid_in_my_cs_lecture_ama/,1760053969.0,"It all started with one all nighter. just one.

I told myself, ""I'll shower after I finish debugging."" That was a month ago.

At first, I thought no one noticed. But today, when I sat down in my cs lec, the dude next to me subtly slid his laptop one seat away, while still maintaining eye contact like he was trying not to make it obvious.

By the time the prof started talking about time complexity, I had a profound epiphany and I finally understood asymptotic behavior, because my hygiene, too, was unbounded. In particular I'm in the class O(dirty).

The guy next to me eventually opened a window even though it was 6 degrees outside. I guess he decided hypothermia was preferable. A girl behind me whispered, ""bro smells like recursion, it just keeps coming back.""

I stayed perfectly still, hoping if i didn't move, the stench wouldn't propagate. then my hoodie betrayed me. Every time i adjusted it, it released a new for-loop of stench into the room. 6-7 people left the lecture every time i moved. When the prof said ""something smells off about this code,"" EVERYONE turned and looked directly at me.

I'm not even mad. I earned this title. I'm the product of 6 assignments and 0 showers. I'm the asymptote of hygiene, I can get arbitrarily close to clean, but never actually reach it.

Anyway, I have a midterm tomorrow. i'll shower right after that. maybe.",submission,41

It's better than nothing. And if you keep on doing it you will somehow start making a progress and eventually take a proper shower soon!!,comment,1
