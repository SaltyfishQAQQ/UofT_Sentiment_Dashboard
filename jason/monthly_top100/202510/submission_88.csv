So, this might sound a little weird, but hear me out.

I’ve been spending a lot of time at Robarts lately (like 9+ hours a day). Midterm season, you know how it is. The place has kind of grown on me. The brutalist architecture, the eternal hum of fluorescent lights(at least I like to imagine that there is), the way the temperature ranges from Arctic tundra to mild volcano depending on the floor. It’s home now.

But last night, something strange happened.

I was on the 11th floor, the haunted one, yeah I know the stories(there is none, I made them up), but I don’t believe in that stuff… usually, and I swear the lights flickered in Morse code. I looked it up. It said:

**“LEAVE NOW.”**  ( I don’t actually know Morse Code)

I laughed it off. Thought maybe I was just sleep-deprived. Happens to the best of us.(This is true)

Then the printer started printing by itself(there wasn’t a printer). Blank pages. Hundreds of them. Each one soaked with the tears of students past. Probably just a malfunction. I asked the desk worker about it and he just handed me a Timbit and whispered, ""You saw it too, didn't you?” (I’m lying)

Anyway, I ignored all that because I had a paper due. Classic UofT priorities. (It was a pset)

But around 3 am(it was 6pm), the books started rearranging themselves on the shelves(books don’t move). Alphabetically at first. Then by emotional impact. Then in reverse chronological order of the authors’ regrets. I saw a copy of *Organic Chemistry* cry a single tear. Not metaphorically. Like it wept. From the spine.(I was the one crying)

I tried to leave, but the escalator to the ground floor kept moving *up(I use the stairs)*. No matter where I got on. At one point I ended up in a floor that doesn’t exist on the campus map. It was just... infinite cubicles and the sound of whispering TA feedback. All of it said, *“See rubric.”(I got an assignment back)*

Eventually, I had to barter with a raccoon in a UofT hoodie to escape.(It was a squirrel) His name was Gary. He has tenure.(It’s a squirrel)

Anyway, wondering if this is just a normal part of midterms or if I should maybe transfer to York.  
Thoughts?(Psets are a goverment contruct and not real)",submission,44

(All jokes aside, I have never lost a book I've borrowed. More importantly, though, good luck with the psets and midterms.)",comment,4
