I believe I have actually fallen in love with MAT157,MoteChoonke,1o1pq59,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1o1pq59/i_believe_i_have_actually_fallen_in_love_with/,1759963476.0,"When I enrolled, I thought MAT157 was just “hard calculus.” I didn’t realize it was beautiful calculus.

in the first lecture, the prof walked in, no slides, no notes. She wrote some symbols on the chalkboard and my heart skipped a beat.

By the third lecture, I wasnt taking notes anymore. I was staring in awe. At the epsilons, sigmas, and quantifiers. The way they curled delicately at the edge of the board. The way the professor said “given any ϵ > 0” with such dominance.

It truly was over for me. I started dreaming in quantifiers. I told my friends i was “studying limits of sequences” but really I was rereading the definition of bijectivity like it was poetry.

When the prof said “this wont be on the quiz”, i swear i felt heartbreak.

Then last week, during a particularly beautiful proof about bounds, I realized something. It wasn’t my prof I loved. It wasnt the chalk. It wasn’t even the math. It was MAT157 itself.

The way it challenges me, hurts me, tells me im wrong, then softly says “if a sequence is convergent it must be bounded.”

No other course has ever made me feel so small yet so (uncountably) infinite. I know this sounds crazy, but i think MAT157 is my soulmate. I’m gonna tell my parents I’m dating a real number.",submission,125
