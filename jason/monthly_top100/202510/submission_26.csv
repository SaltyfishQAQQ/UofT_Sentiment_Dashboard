I may have accidentally proposed to my CS partner,MoteChoonke,1o0syv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1o0syv1/i_may_have_accidentally_proposed_to_my_cs_partner/,1759875088.0,"It started like any other night in Bahen. 3 a.m., 2 Monster cans deep, compiler errors everywhere.

We’d been pair programming for 6 hours straight, one laptop between us, with our knees almost touching, and the most physical contact either of us had since orientation week.

I was debugging his code when I said, “Bro, if this finally runs without segmentation fault, I’m marrying you.”  
He didn’t laugh. He just looked at me. Dead serious. Eyes bloodshot from 4 days of no sleep. We hit ""Run"". No errors.

  
The terminal printed “Compilation Successful” and we looked at each other, cheeks flushed. Without thinking, he whispered: “so.. when’s the wedding?”

  
I froze. My hand was still on the keyboard. His was on top of mine. The air smelled like tears and tims double-double. I didnt know what to do, so i just nodded.

  
Now it’s been two weeks. we still haven’t talked about it. But every time he commits code to the shared repo, the commit message invariably ends with “for us ❤️.”

  
I’m starting to think I might actually be engaged. Anyway, what's semester highlight so far?",submission,172
