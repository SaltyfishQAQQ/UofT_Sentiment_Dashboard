It was total insanity, with elevators so packed that by the time they arrived, no one could get it, or some tiny person would try to squeeze in.   Is it always like this, or was it especially busy today?  And I saw so many people take the elevator to go up single floors - super frustrating! PSA: there are stairs that you can take to get between floors 9 and 14... ",submission,65

EDIT: not trying to defend international students btw, just trying to explain what's happening, the campuses are way overcrowded this year

EDIT 2: I'm wrong, see below.",comment,-13

But this is what I am seeing in the 2025-26 budget report (all emphasis is mine):

>On January 22, 2024, the Federal Government introduced a new cap on international student permits for 2024 aimed at reducing the number of new permits issued nationally by 35%. For 2024, the cap was administered through a restriction in the number of permit applications reviewed for undergraduate studies from out of country applicants. These applicants now required a Provincial Attestation Letter (PAL) from a limited pool managed by each Province in order to be considered for a study permit. Graduate students were exempted from the cap. In 2024, the University received sufficient PALs to meet our targets, however, **the new process created significant uncertainty in international markets that likely impacted demand and contributed to the lower than planned intake this year**.

>...

>In September 2024, the Government announced a further 10% reduction in international permits for 2025 and extended the new PAL requirement to graduate students and in-country international undergraduate applicants (ie. those who enrolled in and are applying from Canadian high schools). Our PAL allocation for 2025 should be sufficient to meet our targets although we are requesting additional PALs from the Ministry if they become available in order to provide some flexibility if conversion rates decrease.

>...

>It is important to note that the University separately manages domestic and international enrolment spaces. Each pool has separate targets and we endeavour to fill all of our funded domestic spaces each year. We do not fill domestic spaces with international students. **In fact, in 2024 we admitted more domestic students than funded for given the very strong demand and softening of the international market. Although, this is only a temporary measure as we cannot sustain this growth on domestic tuition revenue alone.**

The actual enrolment report for 2025-26 is not available right now, I think. I'm not a native English speaker so my interpretation might be wrong actually, but I think what the last part is saying is the same thing I said in my original comment: that the university is admitting more domestic students to make up for loss of international students, but like the report says this is not sustainable since you would need too many domestic students and the university can't support that.",comment,-3

> This year, the University had new intake of 17,022 undergraduate students, which was 661 more than last year but 245 (-1.4%) less than planned.

There was not a significantly large increase in new admits (above growth targets).

Also, the uncertainty of the policy changes is less of an issue now than it was a year ago.",comment,4
