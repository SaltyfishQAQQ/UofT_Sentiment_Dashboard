Dining hall fees for people who don't have a meal plan,Impressive-Farm6773,1nuj8s3,https://i.redd.it/tz7zwlav5csf1.png,1759252822.0,"in case you get hungry between classes and need a close place to eat or want to join your residence buddies this is how much New College & Chestnut dining halls charge people who don't have a meal plan. Definitely not a sustainable option on student budget but just wanted to share for those wondering as I couldn't find this online. 

Also both of the cafeterias are all you care to eat after you pay this fixed enterance fee so you won't need to pay again for additional plates or drinks. Other than new college, University college dinning hall migh be a good option as well and they don't charge a fixed enterance fee so you only pay for what you eat",submission,261

Depending on the menu items, I can probably get my value for $20. That being said, I wouldn’t do it every day and for every meal. And the menu at the cafeteria is only good in theory, the actual execution can suck sometimes.",comment,42
