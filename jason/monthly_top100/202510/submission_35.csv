How do I go to class when im still struggling so hard with grief?,Possible-Run-8791,1nutwi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nutwi7/how_do_i_go_to_class_when_im_still_struggling_so/,1759278379.0,"TW: talks about suicide


My best friend passed away last semester due to suicide, the last time I saw her was on campus, and I struggle even attending some lectures because they’re in the halls I would be attending classes with her, or even like common areas and food places is such a struggle, and i usually end up with a panic attack. it was near the end of last semester so i didnt go to any of my classes. But now im so worried im falling behind academically because I cant focus and all the trauma comes back every time i enter these rooms. And honestly im just unsure what to do or how to mitigate this, my other friend who was hers as well,  switched campuses because she had a similar problem but i dont have that ability.

does anyone have any advice on what i should do? im trying to figure out things with accessibility services but im not sure how much that can help. I am a third year student by the way, so this is especially a time where I need to lock in.",submission,133

I suggest you also reach out to UofT health and wellness, you can book appointments with them or talk to them over the phone. They are experts and are trained to support students. I also recommend reaching out to every prof in every course you are taking, probably by email. It doesn't have to be well-written; you can copy-paste what you wrote in your post. Just let them know you're struggling right now and that you are trying. They will work with you, they are humans too.",comment,54

I'd suggest prioritizing your wellbeing over your academics at the moment. 

Please check out the student resources for mental health here: https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/task/support-when-you-feel-distressed/ 

There is nothing wrong with lowering your course load too if its too much to manage, you can take courses over the Summer afterwards to make up for it.

I wish you the best of luck through these tough times, and I encourage you to reach out to these support systems.",comment,21

As for things you can do:
 - Talk to your registrar and figure out what accomodations are available to you. Usually can do something like taking only half your course load and maybe taking a half semester longer at the end to accommodate for that. (Sometimes this will turn into a full year delay due to course availabilities in 1st/2nd semester.)
To that end - I know taking more time might be more costly, but think about it this way - if you try, but struggle now and possibly don't pass courses then you've lost all that money anyway. Oftentimes it's better to make that decision early and spend that little bit of extra time and money off the bat so that you can do the best you can in your courses now.
 - Talk to your profs; often they'll actually be quite accommodating if you present them with a valid reason, which this very much is. 

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out, and I wish you as much strength as possible for this time :)
You've got this :)",comment,18

I can't imagine how your feeling. While I would like to help, from what you have described this sounds like something far beyond what anyone on here can help you with. Please seek out professional help, whether through the UofT's own mental health services or other sources. 

If I were to say anything, it would be that you should not be afraid to talk to loved ones in your life about your struggles. Combining that and professional help can help substantially.

Take care of yourself. Sending hugs and comfort.",comment,5

1. Please make sure you take care of yourself. If you don't have a therapist, please contact Health and Wellness centre and request short-term counselling sessions; usually it starts with a same day and the counsellor you discuss with may then refer you back for longer sessions.
2. **Accessibility Services requires medical documentation for accommodations**. The social worker, psychologist, or psychiatrist you work with at Health and Wellness centre (or any other clinic) can provide a [Certificate of Disability](https://studentlife.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/Certificate-of-Disability.pdf) that would allow you to register with Accessibility Services for academic accommodations. Note that if you receive a Certificate of Disability, you will also need to fill out [the Online Student Intake Form.](https://clockwork.studentlife.utoronto.ca/user/intake/default.aspx) The deadline to submit registration documents to receive Fall 2025 exam accommodations is October 6, 2025, but there is a procedure in place for students who have registered later than the deadline. Please feel free to DM me on this matter if you have further questions on this!
3. You will need to contact your Registrar to facilitate academic accommodations with course instructors as this matter is an extenuating circumstance that affects your wellbeing. Given the impacts on your academic progress, you should discuss options and a plan with an academic advisor that suits your wellbeing needs. This may include reducing your course load or taking a break from academic studies.
4. It is your discretion to discuss this with course instructors, but the registrar can attest your situation to the instructors on your behalf while maintaining privacy on your situation (majority of the Syllabi provided by UofT course instructors will encourage this procedure for extenuating circumstances). I say this because some instructors are very strict and/or skeptical when students ask for accommodations outside of a disability.",comment,5

I just had a meeting today with accessibility services which really helped and gave me a lot of options, especially with my absences, I will see about health and wellness however my schedule is packed so setting up appointments may be difficult. thank you all for letting me compartmentalise my thoughts and also i guess have a specific idea of what i want to do to help myself through this strange time :)",comment,8

I'm just an internet stranger and I can only imagine how painful this memory is and the strength that you have to continue wanting to try despite the struggle that you are going through. I agree with the comments and I think that it would be a great idea to connect with accessibility services. I'm connected with them for other reasons, and if irc they usually have note-taking services which may help you not miss out as much on the days you feel like you want to take a well deserved break at home or at a place you feel more mentally comfortable in. I don't know what words will be comforting to you, but I sincerely hope that you would find some peace and I will be keeping you in my prayers. All the best.",comment,3
