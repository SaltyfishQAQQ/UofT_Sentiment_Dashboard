as the captain says i am really into men who studies STEM majors. i am a straight 21 year old female with a business major. i switched to business major cause my then boyfriend kinda influenced me into it. i am pretty good with my studies which is why i am more likely to fall for someone who’s studious and intelligent. i recently realized that i tend to fall for men who are into STEM, or any challenging degrees and i find it very hot when the guy explains things about his studies to me. not only this, i am not into men who are into business or any other art major. is it normal? or am i just thinking too much? is it fair to be biased to people just based on their majors when i ain’t a stem student myself?
need your feedback and suggestions guys

That goes the same for anybody. If an art dude likes business girlies, go ahead. If an architect girl likes stem dudes, go ahead. Same with the gays and the les. We just find ourselves gravitate towards people of a certain interest, and that may happen to be an interest totally opposite from yours.",comment,2
