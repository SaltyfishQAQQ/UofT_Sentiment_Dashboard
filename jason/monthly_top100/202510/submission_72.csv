[You Don’t Belong Here: But Then Again… None of Us Do….](https://medium.com/@brian_utsc/you-dont-belong-here-but-then-again-none-of-us-do-190e934b4259)  
It’s that time of year. The feel of the chill autumn air, the sights of the changing leaves, and the distinctive cry of the North American Undergrad: “I don’t belong here”.

I'm giving advice that I've accumulated from a decade and a half of seeing students struggle, and observing what tends to work and what doesn't for them. 

Being ""like 40"" (I'm flattered) is less of a bias than being a professor... even if I could claim to fully remember what it felt like to be an undergrad, talking to faculty is a perfect example of survivorship bias. Almost by definition, we were the ones for whom the system worked out.

So I hope I'm not projecting ""do as I do"", or ""I know how you feel"". What I'm trying to say is ""I have a lot of observational data on students struggling, and I think that sharing those observations might be helpful to the community"". 

So comment taken: I'll keep in mind that I shouldn't try to pretend I ""get it"". But as for ""just chill""... nah... there are too many students at UofT who think no one cares about them. So if I come across as a try-hard for projecting that I care about students, I'm fine with that.",comment,8
