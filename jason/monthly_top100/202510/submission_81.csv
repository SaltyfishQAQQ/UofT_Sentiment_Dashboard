I think a prof may have used AI to grade my paper but I'm not sure,Logical-Box-9662,1o2iawa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1o2iawa/i_think_a_prof_may_have_used_ai_to_grade_my_paper/,1760044900.0,"Ok, so I had to write a 1-page assignment. Prof emails it back with comments, only it's not my paper. Or is it??

I submitted: my page had no name/ student ID at the top and no title, and was structured in indented paragraphs. I used 1 reference.

Prof returned: top of page has my name but with a few letters altered and the wrong student number. It now has a title. Not written in paragraph form, has like 6 references now, but I checked and they lead to real publications.

Now, I didn't notice this at first because I'm a stressed student who can NOT remember exactly what every paper I write looks like. I noticed the messed up name/ student ID but thought it was for anonymity or something. I couldn't access all the comments prof left so before even reading through the doc I emailed asking if they could be given in a different format. Prof replies, but now it's my original paper, which has some similar elements but is definitely different. The comments were also different. One comment was the same, but the sentences were different. The grades, noted at the top, were also different.

What could have caused this? Even if my prof did grade the paper with AI, why would it have spit out a different paper? It could be a mix-up, they could've sent over someone else's paper by accident, but what's with the altered name (and I have an uncommon name, and there's no one by the altered name in the course)? They obviously graded my actual assignment, so what's going on??",submission,50

If you want better insight, I might suggest you ask a few leading questions to the instructor about e.g. the possibility you got the wrong file and whether that means someone else got your file earlier / why some of the feedback changed and which feedback you should focus on most / what you should be taking away from the additional sources they communicated to you, and whether that means your own citation were inadequate or whether they were just exemplars or for further interest, etc. The answers may be telling. 

**Since your post is longer, I'll give a longer example in kind** to substantiate the above, and since I know grading is opaque to a lot of students. I'll focus just on your question about how the name issue could have happened since it's easier to communicate.

Here's one charitable possibility: Since they were almost certainly grading in some capacity outside the Quercus environment (since they emailed it back to you with feedback embedded in the file), and since you say you did not include your name or student number in the file itself, then for them to keep track of the downloaded files to be able to return them, they would have probably needed to add names/ids to any files missing a name/id. They could easily make errors when typing those details in if they weren't using batch tools. 

For example, many papers I get from students are just some version of ""final copy final really final.docx"" with no name to say who wrote it (and with the file authorship metadata attributed just to DESKTOP-374451 or similar), with no title to tell me what topic they wrote on, etc. If I'm working outside of the Quercus environment and stumble across one of these, then I might just quickly track down who wrote it, hastily type the info in myself so I know where to send it later, and get back to my grading overload. Lots of room for human error there. I also used to know someone who would combine all submissions into one master doc for grading purposes, so they could save time by scrolling between them instead of opening and closing files. Even more room for error there. 

Most of the other things mentioned can be similarly explained in light of longstanding traditions of offline grading going technologically wonky, being subject to human error, or in terms of further context outside of this post like their pedagogical feedback goals and course workflow. 

Still, none of that precludes AI use, and it's still totally possible (and I think plausible) that it's an AI related issue in this case. But such a conclusion would be underdetermined by the limited context here, especially given how non-tech-savvy many of our colleagues are. So I'd recommend asking the types of questions from my first paragraph to piece things a bit more together.",comment,1
