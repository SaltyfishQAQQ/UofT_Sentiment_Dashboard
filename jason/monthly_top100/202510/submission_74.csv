A wave of a strong, funky, foul, stinky, and McDonald sauce smelling is coming from them. Instead of smirking on your phone, please give yourself a whiff, holy.

Please I know it is midterm season but before you get on campus slab on some deodorant or shower with soap. The whole room is smelly and you’re making other students leave the room. 


Thank you,
