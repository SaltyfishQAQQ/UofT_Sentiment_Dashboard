# [*A Message from the President*](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/community-updates#presence)[ ](https://www.utoronto.ca/utogether/community-updates#presence)

Dear University of Toronto community, 

I hope that the new academic year is off to an inspiring and fulfilling start. Today, I want to share an update about changes ahead across our three campuses. 

Following discussions with academic and administrative leaders, the University is moving forward with plans to ensure that we have a critical mass of administrative staff present on our campuses five days per week (Monday to Friday), while honouring our institutional commitment to considering alternative work arrangements. At the heart of this decision is our commitment to an academic community where students, faculty, librarians and staff learn, work, debate, and solve problems face to face. This in-person experience is the foundation of our vibrant campus life. 

Being present with and for one another matters. In our [Statement of Institutional Purpose](https://governingcouncil.utoronto.ca/secretariat/page/university-toronto-statement-institutional-purpose), we emphasize our dedication to “fostering an academic community in which the learning and scholarship of every member may flourish.” Since I first joined U of T as an undergraduate student, then as a professor, Dean, and now President, I have gained immeasurably from that community. At each stage I have been informed and inspired by the interactions that fuel teaching, learning, research, professional and career development, as well as personal growth.  

Nurturing a dynamic community of more than 100,000 students and learners requires a critical mass of people on campus. It means that students, faculty, librarians and staff have access to in-person services when they need them, that more of the spontaneous and multi-disciplinary “collisions” that spark ideas can take place, and that a visible tri-campus presence can thrive. 

We know this change may be challenging for some staff. Campuses and divisions will initiate this shift beginning in January 2026, or sooner in some cases, with the understanding that it may take several months or more to realize. As always, our HR and operations colleagues will provide guidance and support on plans and space to help make this transition as smooth as possible. 

Thank you for your dedication, flexibility, and all you do for U of T. I look forward to the energy and momentum we will create together as we increase our in-person staff presence across our three campuses. 

Warm regards, 

Melanie A. Woodin

President, University of Toronto",submission,155

As a U of T staff member, this is terrible news. It really goes against the university’s commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, especially when it comes to matters that can have huge impact on people’s lives.

The flexibility of WFH when possible *is not just a “nice to have” benefit*.

People really value it because it not only improves their quality of life, work-life balance, and mental/physical health, but also allows people with many responsibilities—like young parents, single parents, people living with disabilities—to have a chance at juggling a full-time job and those responsibilities.

Moreover, housing in the GTA is incredibly unaffordable, so WFH allows people to be able to look further out from Toronto for a home while working for U of T. It’s one thing to have to commute 4 hours a day to work only once a week, but another to have to do it 3 times or more.

If this RTO mandate isn’t outwardly, unmistakably anti-DEI, I don’t know what is.

Personally, my position isn’t front-facing (not even digitally) and most of my job is performed at the computer. I only come on campus for projects and meetings that require me to physically be on campus, which is the perfect arrangement, IMO.

If I come to the campus just for the sake of being on campus, I would just go into the office in the morning, come out to heat up my lunch, come back to the office to eat, work the rest of the day, and go home. I literally would not come in contact with any students or faculty. On top of that, I have to endure 2-3 hours of TTC during rush hour. It’s depressing AF compared to WFH.

It would be so much wasted time, energy and money.

**“in-person experience”**—really?! If that was the real reason, the university wouldn’t put out a RTO mandate that affects staff those presence on campus won’t contribute to the in-person experience.

Also:

>Following discussions with academic and administrative leaders

Love that they didn't bother having discussions with the ACTUAL STAFF. Those “leaders” they had discussions with are probably way out of touch with what people actually want.

The higher education sector has been pinched for nearly a decade. In 2019 Ford mandated a 10% tuition cut and froze tuition, and per student grants from the province are already the lowest in the country. This combined with the last several years of sky high inflation has put university budgets into crisis (and for colleges and some universities the impact of the reduced international student volume has been a double hit) so they need help.

Consider this may be the university (and the sector as a whole) trying to stay in the provinces good graces so that one of these things (the freeze or the low grants) can be addressed. They need to be seen as a team player and cooperative to get the Ford government to dig them out of the hole they are in (that ultimately the Ford government plus inflation caused).",comment,15

When my department switched to three days in person, I had to eventually stop coming in on Mondays and Fridays because when I did come in to use my office on those days, I was regularly having to step in to help students in ways that the staff normally would.

I like to be helpful, but it was taking up too much time and I wasn't being paid. Also, when I would encourage inquiring students (or prospective students) to connect with a staff member online or come back another day, it was oftentimes difficult for them to take this as an answer and they'd try to pressure me into helping them since I was right there.

I wasn't the only PhD candidate this was happening to- we raised our concerns, and since the schedule remained in place... I eventually had to stop coming in to protect my time. It was kind of unfortunate- I had enjoyed coming in to work Monday through Friday and appreciated the sense of community. The three day in person approach offered the staff more flexibility which was great from a staff perspective. In my experience as a PhD candidate, it made going about my normal day-to-day more challenging to the point I had to change my routine.

Most older staff have pretty solid severance provisions in their employment contracts...if U of T had to pay them out all at once it would put a dent in their budget (not to mention that it would tarnish the ""good person"" facade they work so hard to maintain). One traditional approach is to make it less than comfortable for older employees to stick around (through various tactics) - when that doesn't work, do some redundancy and payout the severance 

Once the individual is gone, they can slightly change the position responsibilities and hire at a much lower pay - check for whole departments where the staff is less than 5 years old (this would have been spun as ""because of mass retirement"", of course...) 

My advice to anyone stuck in this RTO is hang tight, do your job and don't let them performance manage you - if you want to kick them where it hurts, let them force you out and severance you for the full amount owing!.",comment,2

Your example of being a young parent is a great one. Many of my coworkers have young children as well, and the flexibility of WFH means that they can stay home to take care of their kids and without having to take a sick day, they pick up kids at like 2 or 3 and then go back home to continue to work, they can bring kids to appointments etc.

I can tell how much the flexibility helps their parenthood.

Housing in Toronto is expensive AF, so WFH allows people to buy a home further out since they won’t have to commute 4 hours a day on a daily basis.

What? I never said that.

If you think DEI is all about racism, you are mistaken. Let me quote from [Harvard Business School](https://online.hbs.edu/blog/post/what-is-dei):

* **Diversity:** The presence and participation of individuals with varying backgrounds and perspectives, including those who have been traditionally underrepresented
* **Equity:** Equal access to opportunities and fair, just, and impartial treatment
* **Inclusion:** A sense of belonging in an environment where all feel welcomed, accepted, and respected

Once you understand the definition, it’s easy to see how a blanket RTO mandate—that has recently been pushed by big corporations and institutions like banks and universities—is against DEI that these institutions often champion for.

I have already outlined some examples in the original comment. There are many people who can really benefit from a remote/hybrid work arrangement: young parents, caretakers, people living with disabilities, people living with health issues, etc.

There are people who have to move much farther away from the city due to the unaffordable housing in the GTA. Remote/hybrid work allows them to have the same opportunity to work at U of T as others who live much closer to the campus—a simple example of equity.

As a result of RTO mandate like this, some of these people will possibly have a much harder time juggling with their responsibilities and going on-site much more frequently. Some might even have to find another job because they can't afford to go on-site more regularly due to a variety of circumstances.

For a new position, for example, the requirement of working on-site (for a job that can benefit from a remote/hybrid work arrangement) also limits the candidate pool to those who already reside near campus, is willing to do a long commute, have the privilege to move, etc. Again, not very DEI-friendly.

You can disagree and we can have a discussion, but I’m not sure how I'm a lunatic for making a point with reasonable arguments.",comment,9

No department would obligate PhD students to do this, and would, in fact, discourage them from doing so. In fact, you should have said, “As a PhD student, I’m not qualified to answer that question, but let me direct you to someone who can.”

There is no way you regularly did anything remotely related to what staff do on average, as you don’t have the knowledge required or access to any of the information or tools necessary. 90% of our day-to-day is not interacting with students, even in student-facing roles.

To summarize: you wasted your own time doing things you were not supposed to do and certainly were not entitled to do, while complicating the situation for people trying to pay their mortgages and feed their families, who have external obligations and whose AWAs were discussed at length and approved by departmental leadership and HR. 

Given the entitlement and lack of insight you have displayed here, it is pretty clear why the schedule remained in place, rather than forcing employees to kowtow to the demands of a “PhD candidate” who should have been focusing on writing their thesis instead. ",comment,12

Simply asking people to go into the office now counts as “anti-DEI”? That’s a pretty wild stretch. Work has always required showing up somewhere until very recently, and plenty of companies still offer remote options for people who truly need them.

If commuting or being near campus is such a deal-breaker, then the honest answer is to pursue a remote-only job, they exist in abundance. But trying to frame a normal in-person expectation as some sort of injustice doesn’t really hold water. Not every policy you don’t like suddenly becomes a DEI violation.

And let’s be real: if your entire argument is that you personally don’t want to commute, dressing it up in DEI buzzwords doesn’t make it noble. It just makes it sound like you’re weaponizing inclusivity to avoid an office chair.

In my opinion, part of this is also signaling; plenty of people (like international students) are paying $40K+ a year in tuition, and often another $10–20K just to live close to campus, while administrative staff get to sit at home on salaries funded by that very tuition money.

You're absolutely right- we weren't obligated by the department to do this. We redirected however we could for exactly the reason you gave. Because no one was around on Mondays and Fridays, students and prospective students would wander around looking for anyone who would help them. Even redirecting takes time and adds up. And sometimes students would put pressure on you to help them even after being redirected (e.g., you're here right now... why can't you just help me). 

\- I've been a mid-level staff member at a peer university and have a reference point of what my former work looked like. Of course, we didn't do anything that only a staff member could and should do. It was the kind of questions that either an experienced peer or a staff person could help with. Otherwise, like you say- we had to redirect.

\- No demands were made about the schedule- it was simply a suggestion/question of if there could somehow be some more coverage (e.g., if someone could be around on a Monday or Friday, or if a student staff member could be hired to help).

I know today's announcement will bring up emotions and concerns for folks. The tone of your reply suggests that you might be experiencing some of these feelings. Know that I feel for you and everyone and hope that whatever happens next can be worked out in a good way for everyone.

Look given that you appear to be from Nigeria, I understand that your upbringing may have given a more conservative view than someone born here, my own country of origin is quite conservative as well. 


But that doesn't mean your views are the ones that the majority of people, especially in one of Canada's most diverse cities share. Reddit is predominantly liberal, most North Americans fall somewhere around centrism according to polls and statistics. Your (again) exceedingly conspiracy focused mindset is perhaps a reflection that you feel ""othered"" within the environment you work and live in. Though, and it should be obvious, the same people and structures you defend (idiots making Nazi salutes, the police state) have continually shown time and time again that they have little in the way of respect for people of colour, like you and me. 


Lastly, you seem to have had a lot of time on your hands to reply today. Are you perhaps one of those ""underworked and overpaid"" U of T staff you decried?",comment,8
