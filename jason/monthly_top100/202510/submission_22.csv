Unpopular opinion: I’m really enjoying the UofT social life,user135799765,1nxxxnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nxxxnx/unpopular_opinion_im_really_enjoying_the_uoft/,1759593947.0,"When I first came here I was TERRIFIED about the social aspect due to how badly people talked about it. I’m a commuter student and thought I wouldn’t make any friends, but the moment I got here on the first day of orientation I was immediately surrounded by so many incredible people who I got along with so well. It may be because I’m in the one stream so my classes are much smaller but I’ve found a lovely groove with my classmates and we all study together and get food and walk around nearly every day, and the friends I made at orientation I still see at least once a week for coffee and just to hang out. I really don’t understand why people say the social life here sucks, all you have to do is make an effort. Basically what I’m saying is for future students lurking this sub don’t let what people are saying about the social life here fool you. You will find your people. ",submission,193

Inevitably people that complain about not having a good time of it don't go to events, don't engage in clubs or sports and otherwise expect a social life to be handed to them on a platter.  U of T is a huge university in the middle of one of the most exciting and dynamic cities in the country - anyone finding it hard to find things to do and people to do it with are just not putting in any effort.",comment,33

If it's a program where everyone has to take many of the same classes and are jn those classes together then you're more likely to make friends.,comment,2
