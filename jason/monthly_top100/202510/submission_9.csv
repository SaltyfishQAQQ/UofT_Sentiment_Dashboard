I cried in the Robarts 3rd floor washroom — here’s how it helped me get a 4 GPA,why_just_why_it_hurt,1nz27d9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nz27d9/i_cried_in_the_robarts_3rd_floor_washroom_heres/,1759703509.0,"Last sem, after spending 11 consecutive hours in a what essentially is a concrete prison (affectionately known as Robarts), I hit rock bottom. I hadn’t eaten. I hadn’t blinked. I had watched a squirrel out the window fight another squirrel for a piece of bread like UofT students in a discussion post trying to earn brownie points.

Then, it happened:  
**I cried.**

Here’s how that **ugly cry in the Robarts 3rd floor washroom** helped me secure a 4.0 GPA:

1. **Vulnerability = Strength** Tears are just brain sweat. And that night, my brain was DRENCHED. In allowing myself to break down next to the graffiti that said *""DEATH TO CSC265""*, I learned that growth requires release.
2. **Location, location, location** Robarts 3rd floor isn’t just a place, it’s a mindset. It smells like pain, ambition, and expired Febreze. That night, it became my chrysalis. I entered a worm. I exited… a slightly more organized worm.
3. **Focus through despair™** After I cried, I entered a locked in state so intense that I finished my assignemtns, finished a “take home lab"", fixed my resume, and rewatched The Social Network. I call this method *“scholarly psychosis.”* or what my doctor would say *“That was me during med school.”*

I ended the semester with a 4.0, raising my GPA to a proud 2.1.  
Not because I’m smart.  
Not because I planned well.  
But because sometimes, you need to **lose your absolute mind in a concrete hell-library at 11:32 PM** to truly understand *grit*.

Never forget:  
Pain is temporary.  
But GPA…  
GPA is forever.

Idrk what my current GPA is. I actively avoid looking at it. I covered that part and looked at my grades from last sem and they were 4.0 for all of them. For all I know I could have a 3.3, 3.1, 1.6. I know its not under 1.5 bc I haven't gotten an acdemic probation email yet. So 2.1 is a conservative guess which is not even based off the last time I checked my GPA.

But if I mentally trick myself into believing I’m on the verge of AP, I can and will always play it safe by getting the highest grade I personally can achieve. So in my mind, my GPA is a 2.1, so 1 failed and 1 low course could probably put me basically into Probation.

TL;DR: No Idea what my GPA is(actively avoid checking) 2.1 is what I think the bare minimum of what it could be.",comment,11
