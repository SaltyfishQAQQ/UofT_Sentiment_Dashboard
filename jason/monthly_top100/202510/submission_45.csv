I go to New college dining hall about everyday but Im starting to have a real issue with how the staff treat the students there. I've left numerous times in tears because it feels like I've been verbally accosted for simply taking more than 2 pieces of cheese pizza or putting ice cream in a bowl rather than on a cone. I'm really trying to follow the rules but it feels like they are changing them everyday and then being extremely rude when students don't know. I've seen other students being yelled at too, one guy for taking 3 boiled eggs. Is it not an ""All you care to eat"" service? that's what it says on their website and kind of why I decided to get it in the first place. Am I in the wrong here or just being overly sensitive? Have other people experienced similar? ",submission,102

Clear, consistent rules are fair, but sudden changes and rude behavior aren’t. Since it’s advertised as “all you care to eat,” students deserve clarity and courtesy. You’re definitely not alone.",comment,23
New college Dining Hall Staff are so rude all the time,YumCherryPies,nhalwtx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nvqo9l/new_college_dining_hall_staff_are_so_rude_all_the/nhalwtx/,1759370062.0,"This was last year when the New College dining hall was paid by price for each item rather than scanning once and going in but I feel like it still applies. When I was picking items to go into my wrap I hesitated on saying one item by the label because it was ridiculously misspelled to the point I hesitated to say it since I’ve never heard of it. Instead I gestured at it and I was shouted at for not saying the name. In addition, I picked an ingredient a little more on the right before seeing something else on the left that I wanted and again I was shouted at for not going straight across like a conveyor belt.

New College dining hall has went to shit this year—I heard from students living there that they removed the soda fountain, removed the bottled beverages (Energy drinks, Gatorade, Orange Juice, etc), and even the sushi, pretty much anything that has plastic packaging. This year they made it so that students have to eat in the dining hall and only have a limited amount of take outs, but it’s a stupid rule because everyone has things to do and about 80% of the time I took things to go last year. Residence DONs have also been observed taking things out to go, sometimes the staff try to interfere but they get ignored. A staff even tried to look through a DON’s backpack.

I’m sure they’re just taking ridiculous steps to reduce waste and keep UofT at #1 for being most sustainable, but things have also gotten less hygienic such as not having the pudding in packaged cups but instead in a big bowl where people just scoop from. Same goes with ice cream, it’s just a self serve fountain now and toppings are set out rather than just pre packaged ice cream sandwiches or drumsticks 

I decided not to live there again",comment,30
