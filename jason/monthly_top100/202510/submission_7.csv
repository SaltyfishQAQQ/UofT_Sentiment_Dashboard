I wish you a good recovery. This is a tough go, and these conversations are hard. 

Second, you need to speak with your registrar's office and possibly to register with accessibility services. Ask your registrar what accommodations they can get for you. If you choose to go on yourself,  you are not required to self disclose at any time to profs or TAs.

Definitely email your registrar and either book an appointment or ask what your options are in email if you are too freaked out to talk about this in person.

You won't be the first student they've dealt with that has had something like this happen, there is most likely a protocol or process they have where they'll be able to handle everything for you, whether it's getting accessibility services involved, helping you switch to part-time, or helping you figure out how to take a leave of absence. 

If you do decide to take a break, know that people have to pause their education for all sorts of reasons, and there are options for taking a leave of absence without academic penalty.

I hope you can take some time off to process this news. Regarding your questions, there are several ways to go about. 

If I were you, I would first think what I wanted. Do I want to pause my studies? Do I want to take some time off? Or on the other hand, do I just want to continue with minimal accommodations?

Depending on what I wanted, there are different ways of getting there. Some might involve my doctor who would write a letter that conveys the seriousness of your illness without disclosing. Doctors know how to do that. Then I’d talk to my registrar and go from there.

That being said, your health and life are way more important than your studies. I am so sorry you have to deal with this at a time where you should be focusing on becoming independent. I wish you all the best.",comment,27

Truly, it world be brutal news at any point, but in your last year? That’s really rough!

First thing, are you okay? Like, do you have a professional that you can talk to? Mentally, I know you can’t be “okay” with it, but hopefully you’re as okay as you can be. Anxiety right now, depression, fear, shock… all of it is completely understandable. If you don’t already have a therapist, you might want to try shopping around for one now (like you don’t have enough on your plate already, right?).

Next, talk to accessibility services. And I’m going to caution you that it may still be running behind with all the new students, but you need to explain that it’s an emergency situation. They should be able to give you some options like taking time off, deferring your exams to another semester, accommodating you for online courses, etc. From there, you might be able to gain some perspective on what your options are.

Next, do you have a medical team? Do you live in Toronto? Does your family? Toronto has excellent cancer care, but you might want to think about what your options are to have support throughout. Do you have friends who can help you get around here? Do you have space where you live that maybe a sibling could come and stay with you? Would you feel more comfortable being in your hometown with your family if you’re sick? I have no recommendations one way or another, just things to ponder.

Students don’t typically have great insurance as part of their tuition. Hopefully you’re also still eligible for a parent’s plan. While all the medication administered in treatment will be covered by the government, the as-needed medications can add up quickly, and it’s not unusual to need to try different meds before you find the right one. That can add up and eat up your maximum for medical coverage under your insurance. Please know that if you’re an Ontario resident, you can apply for trillium drug benefits, which would cover most of the cost, which people don’t always know about.

I really wish I could offer you a hug right now.

Basically… school is the last thing you need to worry about right now. If you are an international student, make sure you check with an international advisor about what dropping classes would mean for your eligibility for UHIP or ability to stay. But I promise you, right now is the time to put yourself first. You may need to move (depending on the living arrangements… if you share an apartment with someone who has lots of friends over, for instance… you may need to find a place where you can be very careful about your immune system during treatment. Same with attending classes. For nose, I’d recommend you mask regularly to prevent getting a respiratory infection, which could potentially delay treatment further.

If you want to talk, please feel free to message me! I went through the cancer system with my dad two years ago, so I might have a bit of knowledge that helps? Also, if you just want to talk about something else, that’s cool too. I’m not in town for this week, but I’ll be around a few days of the week every week for the rest of the semester, if you want to get together with someone, work out some kind of plan (or not… also a valid option!) or just have a good cry or whatever. (I don’t live in Toronto, but as a PhD student, I don’t have to be there daily).

Sending you so, so much love right now. Focus on yourself for now, nothing else is more important!",comment,26

On the other hand if things like targeted therapy is applicable then you might just have enough energy to finish your degree. From my limited understanding stage three almost implies necessity for immediate treatment so your doctor should provide you with a plan soon. In a way of speaking, if you're aiming to maximise your chances and follow your doctor's recommendations, there might not be a lot of options for you to choose from.

I am praying for you and I hope you get through this tough and challenging time and I hope you have a speedy recovery. Take care of yourself. Your health comes first before anything. Before your education, degree, your career. Your romantic relationship. Before anything take care of yourself. Take a deep breath and here are your options.

I will get to the point because I really want to help you out. I've been in this university for five to six years. Your case is a very serious case.

 1. Firstly, you want to do is to talk to an academic advisor/your registrar and seek accommodation, and ask for their suggestions as to what to do, as soon as possible. Take documentation to them from your hospital or physician. 
 2. They will help you out and give you advice on what to do, and you will email all your profs explaining your situation to them. Chances are, they will be more than accommodating and they will be very understanding and considerate. You could most likely get accessibility if you wish to continue your studies during this time and finish, and it will help you to manage a workload.
 3. Option three is that at UofT, you can stop studying for up to three years and then come back and finish your degree.

So don't ever feel stressed. I know that it's not an easy thing to say. I don't want to say ""I want to put myself in your shoes"" because that is not what you're dealing with is not something to take lightly and it's not something easy. I wish you have all the strength to go through it and things will get better. Keep your head up. There's a lot of support out there. Do not panic. Take it deep breath again.

The first thing you do is to talk to an academic advisor. Explain everything to them. Generally, say that you avoid and you need help, and they will guide you through it. Then they would advise you to email your professors, or they will let your professors know themselves. But do not worry about graduating. Worry about your health at the moment. Your health is number one. And degree jobs and all that other stuff comes secondary because without your health, none of that none of those things are important.",comment,3

Talk to your doctor first to understand treatment options and make the best available choice. Don’t hesitate to ask many questions and consult different doctors if possible. Start the treatment asap. 
Cancer nowadays is not the sentence, people can live for decades even with so called developed stages. Hope you have done PET scan or will do it soon, read it carefully and discuss what can be done in your particular case for the best outcome. Doctors can do many tests before to understand what is the cancer type and how to treat it. Focus on your treatment and health first. As you mentioned marrying talk to the doctor about possibility to have kids in the future, they can help before you start chemotherapy. Talk to your family. And friends, you will need help and people if they addressed will help. After you will get your treatment plan you can decide what to do with university, most probably you should drop your classes now with the plan to return to your studies in one year, ( my estimation for chemo, radio, surgery if any) and recovery from them). The only concern if any is government financing, guess they have some ways to sort it out without you paying your loans in 6 months. You are still young man and alive, put your efforts in the treatment and being happy in the coming 10 years. . And then fellow 10 years. Good luck on your treatment.

I would recommend talking to your doctors, registrar, friends, family, etc. 

Your doctors should be able to provide you with a decent idea of the prognosis of your cancer (i.e. 5yr mortality rate, often times there are clinical decision tools for this sort of thing). Some cancer's are not very deadly (breast, papillary thyroid), and some are close to a death sentence (pancreatic, esophogeal SCC) and depending on that, your own values, etc. you will likely need to make some very difficult decisions.

Do genetic testing to learn what type of cancer it is. You might be able to fight it with aggressive immunotherapy, especially since you’re still young.

Consider going on leave to assess the values in your life that are important. I am a graduate student, and while school seems like the most important thing when young, it really isn't. 

Accommodations can be made, but honestly there isn't an equitable way to assign accommodations which can be considered fair. If you do go this route and you do poorly because you are feeling absolute shit during a test, there isn't anything the University can do. If you write a final exam and half way you can't finish, it is on you. There isn't any recourse.
It is best to come back once you are healthy and you have a good understanding of your baseline, so accommodations can be made which is fair to you. 

I know it's not exactly the same, but my mother got cancer during my undergrad. My mom insisted that I continue in school, and it was awful. I wish I took a leave. Just the mental strain was extremely stressful and I was unable to perform in my studies due to the ups and downs.

Under university policy, once accommodations have been granted, the student’s experience is deemed equitable by definition. For example, if a student with ADHD is provided with 1.5× extra time on exams, the institution considers that adjustment sufficient to ensure fairness. If the student later appeals a decision, the policy framework assumes that the accommodations already “leveled the playing field,” leaving no further grounds for exception.

University policy is also explicit that once a student begins a final exam, their work will be graded as is—regardless of illness or circumstance. Students are instructed to leave the exam and report to the registrar *before* beginning if they are unwell, so that a deferral can be arranged.

Therefore, when you suggest that accommodations can be made equitable, you imply that some specific adjustment could truly “level the playing field” such that the student’s performance can be judged on the same terms as others. From my experience, I cannot believe that providing “extra time” or any similar measure could ever make a student’s learning experience genuinely equitable.

To claim that equity can be *achieved* through accommodations is, frankly, misguided. It is unfair to suggest that any predetermined adjustment could ensure that a student in such circumstances feels that their academic work has been judged on equal footing.",comment,0

Having lost both my parents during my academic studies, I understand how strange people can become in times like these. Getting others to be authentic and truthful starts to feel impossible. Without clear facts, making decisions becomes incredibly difficult, and the effort it takes to get people to be honest and straightforward with you can be exhausting. People around you can become unintentionally disingenuous, even when they mean well.

In both of my experiences, I wanted to make sure the limited decisions I had to make were as well-informed as possible — and that required facts. That’s why, even though OP is going through so much, I think it’s important they have clarity about the administrative side of things. You and I don’t know OP personally — their values, priorities, or how they want to move forward — so the best we can do is help them understand the facts and policies that will affect their next steps.

As someone who has also been an instructor at a university, I want to give a fair warning that administration can sometimes feel heartless. No set of accommodations can truly make this kind of situation fair. I remember studying from the hospital — it was incredibly hard. Being well-rested, eating properly, and minimizing stress are so important for recovery, and unfortunately, university life doesn’t exactly nurture those needs.

Everything I’ve said comes from first-hand experience within the system. I can understand why what I said might sound harsh, but I promise you, it comes from empathy — not from a lack of compassion.",comment,3

I'm not trying to convince OP one way or another. Having been through from one end to the other. In retrospect, I personally don't think an undergraduate degree is something that is super important in the greater scheme of life. That's all. 

I think OP should have all the information to make the best decision for themselves. We don't know what their prognosis is, which medical options they have available. Even doctors won't be honest with you entirely, because of malpractice. Everyone becomes extremely positive around you because they can't deal with the situation.",comment,1
