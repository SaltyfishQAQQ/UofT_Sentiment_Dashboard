I hope your days are going much better than mine. To cut the long story short, I got stood up to go with some girls to a frat party and I didn’t have the courage (or maybe the stupidity) to go alone, so I walked back with my fresh makeup, sexy party clothes and trying not to cry to ruin my makeup( why, its not like I’m gonna use it anyways😟) ANYWAYS. I asked to go with two girls (one of them was from a friend group I recently joined. They have all been really nice to me and friendly. We’ve ranted together, hung out together, and have even more outings planned for the future) and the other one was someone I just met today who this girl met before me. They told me to get ready two hours ahead of time and meet them somewhere. I texted and called on insta, cuz stupid me didn’t get their numbers. They both said they would text me, so I texted them ahead of time to confirm plans and ask a few questions abt what I can and can’t carry to the party….no response. I realized that tho we were in the same grp chat, me and my frnd grp friend didn’t even follow eachother. So I texted the other girl and requested a follow from the first…no response. Scared and very unsure, I still carried myself to our meetup spot and stood there for a good ten minutes. People started to pass by and they would look at me uncomfortably long and some stupid group of boys pushed one of his friends at me. I’d had it, so I walked back, utterly ashamed because this exact scenario had happened b4 but with a different person. Why do people always stand me up? Like I genuinely don’t get it. I just got here, I don’t wanna go to a party by myself, especially not my first one. I’m literally sitting in my room like an idiot fully done up. I’m so mad and sad. This girl is in my friend grp, I’m gonna have to see her again VERY soon. Probs tomorrow. I genuinely trusted her, how do I even deal with this. I don’t want to talk to her, or even see her anymore. I’m lowk a pushover who has a history of bullying, am I just gonna stay a doormat for the rest of my fucking life.

i’m so sorry this happened to you :( i truly truly hope that it was just a misunderstanding and that they had no intentions of doing that to you, because that’s just really unkind, but I 100% relate with the feelings of embarrassment and frustration you’re expressing! no one deserves that and especially since it’s your first year ( i’m assuming ) and first party too. 

please try not to dwell on it too much and honestly no company is better than bad company, if they really did stand you up on purpose then those aren’t the type of girls you want to be associating with anyways. you’ll find your people soon, i promise uu!! and if you ever need anyone to talk to pm me im a first year life sci student here :)",comment,66

I really hope it was just a mix up and not on purpose because that’s so unfair, especially when it’s your first time trying to go out like that. don’t feel bad for not going alone either, that was honestly the smart choice annddnndnd tbh no company is better than bad company, if they left you hanging then they’re not people you should have to rely on anyways. you will find your real people soon and when you do it’ll feel so much better than this.

These are NOT your people. You are also not a doormat, you are a somebody. If you do not have the courage to say something the  n don't but do not try to be friends with these people anymore. Whatever your interest or likes are, find groups on campus or elsewhere of people with similar interests and go from there. 

Never double text another person again. If you are supposed to go out with someone and you tried calling or messaging to confirm and no reply, plans are off.

We can not control what people do or how they behave but you can control how you respond. All the best to you!

Don’t force things. I understand you want to have fun and go to parties, but the fun only lasts for so long. You are lucky to be at a great university, apparently one of the best, focus on taking care of yourself and your studies. Partying should be the last thing on your to do list, and if you make it your last priority, that’s when opportunities just so happen to appear. Also, a frat party sounds horrible…. so don’t feel bad.",comment,2

People don’t meet “their people” right away. And you know how overwhelmed you’re feeling right now? They are too! It’s only a few weeks in, everyone is trying to figure out which way is up!

I’m a PhD student (in my thirties) who just started as well- I’d be happy to chat over coffee sometime next week if you’re feeling a little unsettled so far, I spent several years working with first year students, so I think I have some decent insight!

While you wanted to party and socialize, sadly you were the one who got ghosted.

People have times that never make sense and i fully understand how you feel because i was once thou person who meased up someones feelings. 

I learned by failing and may you learn that you deserve friends who really love you, learn not by the fact that the party was a fail but that your journey will never end, literally!

Everyone thinks oh its over in 4 years, man it couldnt be farther from the truth. The last social connection on indeed will lead you to your first social party and that will probably have better fun then a uni party.

You'll maybe meet a 100 soulmates at 100 at a bingo match

And they are soulmates cuz you all like knitting.

I do think it was the right choice to not go alone to my first frat party after all the allegations. Imma give myself a badge of responsibility for that one. My frnd grp frnd texted me back the next morning apologizing profusely and explaining that after she left 2 hours before we planned to meet, she had set a 1 hour alarm to take a nap, and had passed out, and slept through the alarm. She was feeling tired and though the nap would recharge her, but she woke up feeling worse (yknow that feeling when you’re body is screaming that it needs wayyy more rest than a tiny nap). She was sleeping and did not see any of my texts, and had to go home for the weekend to rest and possibly go to the hospital. Idk abt the other girl, and frankly, Idc, I’m too busy to dwell on things like this. I just needed to rant. I ended up going to another 2 parties in one night with the other members of the same frnd group and it was fun asf. Again, thank you sm for your support. i’m glad she’s not a bully, a hater, or a terrible person. Have wonderful lives y’all",comment,1
