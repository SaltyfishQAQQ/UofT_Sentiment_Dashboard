Every single one of us who has thought of, or gone through UofT, gets thoughts like these. A lot of us changed programs despite doing great in school, some dropped out, others took time off. This is not an isolated issue.

Would it help to talk a bit more? Everything you're saying is valid, but you dont need to go to UofT to become a cop especially after Doug Ford made it easier for people.",comment,53

I want to tell you that you had a vision knew your path, and you could achieve that and get into this school! That’s amazing!
Going through hard time is never problem as it seems, it’s more like life is trying to make you stronger and you can only choose how to react to that.
also as someone who went through the same experience I highly recommend reaching out and using the resources on campus such as health and wellness, you can call them book an appointment and talk to a professional there ( I tried that and they are very helpful)
Here is more resources from student life, they exist to help you essentially:

Im not telling you to drop out but with my circumstances, life just hit me like a brick with all sorts of family and job issues. I was a straight A in hs and got in with a 91 average, but i wasnt prepared for how hard first year classes was going to be, so imagine academic stress compounded with post hs life and on several occasions, i was dangerously close to just calling it “quits”. Everyone has a different story, im sure most of us can handle it cuz everytime i go to campus, most students seem happy and content with themselves but i couldnt, and i decided that my mental health was more important. 

Talk to someone in student services, a counsellor to be exact, not an academic advisor unless you wanna get judged and cross examined and make your anxiety worse. Talk to your TAs as well if you’re comfortable enough cuz a lot of them have your genuine interest at heart if you open up to them.",comment,5

It doesn’t matter where you go for undergrad.

I went to Guelph, not far from Toronto, but in a whole different world. I didn’t feel pressure to get the top marks in the class (actually, I wasn’t a great student in undergrad and I still got into grad school). Especially if you’re used to consuming American TV shows that are all about getting into the “best” school… it’s not really such a thing here.

I was often one of the higher performing students in undergrad, but not a good tester. I was dealing with a lot of crap going on. And I still managed to get into a good masters program. (Now I’m a PhD student here, so yes, eventually I learned to keep on top of my work, but it didn’t come easily!)

First year is brutal everywhere, but when you’re used to being the smartest kid in the class, it’s a shock when you’re not. But you also don’t need to be. It’s okay. Your first year isn’t for thriving, it’s for surviving! I honestly dont know if I could still survive five undergrad classes now!",comment,6

Perhaps I can offer a retrospective.

It is hard. You are doing a hard thing. No one argues that UofT is a super fun cute easy time and anyone that says so is lying.

That being said, you are, what, 4, 5 weeks into the most dramatic and drastic change in your life to date? Of course it's hard. You're not used to it yet. You have not yet discovered a routine that works for you (study habits, food habits, exercise/ recreational habits). You have not yet found that balance. It's like trying to run a marathon without training and being devastated that you aren't able to. It takes time to build habits in academics and strike a work-life balance.

When I graduated high school (now a decade or so ago), I was also an A+ student. On Honour Roll, top ten in my class. Grades are largely over inflated in high school so you may get into your program so It is understandable that the sticker shock is very real for you. In my degrees, I have failed, deferred, CRNC courses. And I am still standing.

Dropping out is not the answer. The long term emotional and financial repercussions will be so much more unbearable than you sitting down and having an honest conversation with yourself about what you need to do to succeed here.

Seek out study groups. Attend office hours. The first rule of holes, academic or otherwise, is to STOP DIGGING.

Exercise as much are you are willing or able.

Eat well.

I think your generation faces some more difficulties than mine. We did not have TikTok's and reels showing us what others claim to be doing and how ""successful"" they are. Turn off that noise. Focus on you. Your academics and extracurriculars. Your community.

Access additional services that others have mentioned.

Anyways, I wasnt the best in high school but I tried and ended up going to uoft. My advice is, that you know its a too school in Canada right? Take that into consideration. It’s going to be difficult because there is competition. We are the Harvard of the North. It’s not easy being in this school and I get it. But also be proud of yourself. Start with daily affirmations. You did it, you got into the top school of Canada. Take your negative thoughts and flip it.
