After writing about what I did that day, I also give it a score from 1 to 10. Thankfully, I haven’t had any 1s yet, though I’ve come somewhat close.

There’s no specific criteria for my scores. Generally, if I felt good, was social, made new friends, or had a really fun time hanging out, I give it a high score. However, if I wasn’t social and stayed in my room the whole day, I’d probably give it a 3 or 4.

For example, on September 2 (the first day of classes), I ate breakfast with my roommate, made several new friends throughout the day, and played some fun games with a bunch of people. While it might sound simple, I had so much fun that day, and looking back, I still hang out with several of the people I met then. This was my first 10/10 day.

The average score for September comes out to 6.82/10. I'll probably do this for October as well.",submission,75
