There are 2 streams of professors at U of T, teaching and research. There are also sessional instructors and grad students who teach.

Do some undergraduate research and get the best out of your education. Also go to your tutorials, your TAs are quite capable (if not more) at teaching the content than your professor.

They do care about education to the extent that they are producing people who are at the top but not as much for people who can’t adapt and fall behind. They need to churn out researchers after all and UofT still manages it despite these problems. Profs care about the ones that intend to work with them in the future. For the ones that do well, the expertise of the profs are useful. 
Getting everyone on the same level creates even more competition for a few spots so the incentive is just for people to rise to the top I guess, sadly.

Same for pre Med and Pre Law. More people wanting to be doctors and lawyers than can be sustained by bringing everyone up to the level to all compete for Med and Law school",comment,8

They can choose when they apply I guess, but you have to remember to get to the point they are at (masters + PhD + usually a post doc) they were doing majority research and very few people would pursue academia just to teach; I'm saying this as one of the few that did.
