I’m amazed by how much 🤢 - inducing moments I’ve experienced in just two days alone. 

There’s constantly people who are coughing (mouth open, wet cough). Some may attempt to cough onto their fist, elbow or inside their shirt… sure, the germs aren’t going to be as pervasive as if you had coughed in someone’s face, but a great deal of them still “sprays” onto the surrounding surface and air; wear a mask. 

There’s persons blowing HARD into napkins. I get it, you a got a runny nose, and this is the standard… but is it really THAT hard you have to blow? I’ve seen people deal with allergies but never heard the dump truck mufflers I hear in class. Then they place their snot painted napkins onto the table. They don’t wipe the surface after. They don’t have any container to put it in. Just on the table. Ps, ALWAYS use sanitizer before eating as the table you placed your hands and items onto could’ve been ground zero for this. Mind you, the person doesn’t sanitize their hand after touching and curling up the napkin and repeatedly using it. 

I’ve seen some people pick their legit nose and bite their nails RIGHT next to me. Some dude was digging his scalp - no dandruff but like his head was leaning over to my side and a few cm from my shoulder. 

I actually swear this is some kind of intimidation or dominance tactic. How and why would you be so consistent with this. I’ll die inside if I cough in class even slightly loud - some of yall letting it rip. 

Now, fault isn’t 100% on these folks. I’m sure they’d rather not being sick (barring y’all who picking yourselves.. ew) but bruh. 

Some guy offered his hand to shake mine then used that same hand to take a napkin and blew into it. I wanted to cry dawg.

Just goes to show that having a lot of money doesn't mean you have class. 

All that these people would need to do is wear a mask, which you can get for free at the entrance of Gerstein.

My tinfoil hat theory is that some of these people want to make you sick so you miss classes, fall behind, and free up spots for POSt or research opportunities down the line.",comment,49
