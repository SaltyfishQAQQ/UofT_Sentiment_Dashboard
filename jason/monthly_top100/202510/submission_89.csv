I have no motivator to go to school(like no class crush or anything to make the day brighter). I tried going to the math learning centre for help but just realized I can’t even ask questions properly. Like I understand but I don’t at the same time. and then I ask ChatGPT to explain the math and I literally just want to give up because not even AI is explaining it correctly. Like I wish I could study with someone and discuss ideas but then I’m rlly scared of meeting new people and generally don’t meet people who I click with. I did join a club and signed up for a few things but generally I never met someone I click with. why is it so hard to find someone similar. crashing out yet again

edit: any mat223 students out there, where are yall?",submission,46

People just scared to reach out first, and even if u do take the initiative half the time they have like no conversational skills. Also for some reason the culture here is to basically avoid others and mind your own business. You ever notice that if u get to class early, as people start coming in they choose to sit as spaced out apart as possible? It could just be the specific classes I'm in but it's an interesting phenomenon.",comment,29

Classes are just a place for study. It's not high school where you form and bond friend groups even if there are groups. 99% of ""friendships"" you make in uni stays in uni, because everybody is grown up enough to know not to open up to everyone like they're a kid and this is UofT. If you want friends you should join clubs with similar hobbies. ",comment,10

MAT223 is eating me alive right now. I can't even ask the right questions, so I haven't gone to the math centre. I'm starting to think I need to fully relearn everything.  I should've joined an art-related elective, at least then I'd have something at least tangentially interesting.

I hear there's a comic book club opening soon, I might join that to meet some people. Most of the clubs I find interesting seem Chinese-dominated, and to be honest I'd probably embarrass myself trying to socialize with my shitty Chinese. It is what it is.",comment,3

They are free crafting workshops on Thursdays where people from all over campus, from many different departments, come together to create something they have never tried before. There's very little pressure to make conversation, you can just show up as you are, create, and just be. Might be worth a try! https://harthouse.ca/events/get-crafty-2025-26/2025/10/02/",comment,2

That being said I didn’t meet my best friend until almost the end of fall sem. My other friends were because we were classmates and it grew from there. The only thing is you have to put yourself out there. Talk to people during your classes. Have opinions and be not afraid to express them. You might find someone who will agree with you and then your conversations go from there. And honestly try to romanticize the campus and studying, it’ll be easier that way. And try to stay optimistic, it’s been one month of uni, only one month of getting used to uni compared to high school. So don’t be too hard on yourself because getting used to uni is a process. I only got used to it the summer after my 2nd year. So it definitely takes time. Just know who you are and what you’re here for and honestly you will just attract the friends that are right for you.",comment,1

Try to remind yourself that things are gonna get better, look around and look at all the third and forth years who have a social life and are able to balance everything, they were once in your shoes too. Also as a tip dont make a class crush a motivator to go to school, you willingly made a choice to be here and although some courses you might not have willingly chose you knew u had tl take them before you applied. Theres like over 50000 students at this school across all campuses your sure to find a few that click with you. If you did it in highschool with like 50 times less people you can do it in uni. Good luck and try to remind yourself your doing this for you!",comment,1

I joined the uni a bit late so that probably doesn't help, but all of like the pending work from the classes I missed + lack of motivation is just really starting to get to me. I tried working in the library but that doesn't help much either now. I'm currently in mat137 and mat223, and even though mat137 is relatively fine, mat223 has just been straight up horrendous for me. I really don't get how others find ts easy. I tried joining a study group but barely anyone shows up to those either...
