Anyone find it hard to find someone who wants to be in a serious long term relationship?,Noetic_Acorn,nhlq56b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nx4m2d/anyone_find_it_hard_to_find_someone_who_wants_to/nhlq56b/,1759521274.0,"There are people out there that want serious, long-term relationships, even within this generation, and even at UofT. The problem, however, is a widespread lack of maturity, communication, and mutual respect. 

Another important point to consider is that people don't want to deal with the negative consequences of rejection. This is a double-edged sword, since on the one hand life is about taking risks to some extent, while on the other hand people are often not respectful in declining an advance, even in situations where the advance is modest and respectful.

The worst part, above all, is that people don't tell each other how they really feel. Emotional constipation doesn't serve you in the long-run. If you have a question, ask it. If you have a worry, learn to express it in a reasonable way. Not addressing looming problems or uncertainty will only lead to more pain in the long-term, on top of all the time you've wasted.

Specific to UofT is this weird stoicism where so many people are afraid of showing any vulnerability out of fear that someone will ridicule or exploit said vulnerability. This creates a culture that makes it very difficult to connect with others, since vulnerability is an important and unavoidable part of connection.",comment,48

There is *plenty* of time to find a partner later, and honestly people change so much in their early 20s that it’s often best to settle down a bit later in life.

Idk who is telling you that uni is the best place to find a husband but that sounds like some backwards tradwife bible belt nonsense to me. 

You can still be open to meeting someone without trying to force it.

You're still generally right about older guys going for university/college girls being creeps, though, but it's because of the gap in life experience.
