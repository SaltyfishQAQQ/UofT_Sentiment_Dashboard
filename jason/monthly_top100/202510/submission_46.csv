"Academic integrity case — pressured into admitting, unsure if I can appeal",Puzzled-Respond-7007,1nvoszb,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nvoszb/academic_integrity_case_pressured_into_admitting/,1759363385.0,"Hi everyone, I’m looking for some advice because I feel like I was treated unfairly in an academic integrity process at my university.

Recently, I was called into a meeting about two essays I submitted at University of Toronto.  The original concern (from what I understood) was about possible plagiarism/AI use. But in the meeting with the Dean’s Designate, the focus shifted — he claimed I fabricated sources or cited improperly. That wasn’t what I was initially told.

During the meeting, I was pressured to “admit” to committing an offence. The Dean’s Designate even said something like, *“if you use Grammarly, you are no longer writing by yourself.”*  which doesn't make sense because writing centres, Google Docs spelling check or a thesaurus are technically unauthorized aid. I told him I did use Grammarly, but only for grammar/spelling — never for generating content or citations. (As far as I know, Grammarly doesn’t even fabricate citations.)

I tried to explain that the article I cited was real but may have been taken down, and that I wasn’t fabricating anything. I even submitted evidence, but I don’t think they reviewed it. I felt cornered and basically admitted guilt because it seemed like the only option to avoid things escalating.

Now I’ve received my sanctions:

* 0 on both essays
* 0 in the course
* 1-year annotation on my transcript

When I asked about appealing, the response I got was basically: *because you admitted to committing an academic offence, you can’t appeal the “finding of guilt,” only the sanctions.* They also said that “not wanting to go to tribunal” isn’t a valid reason for admitting falsely.

I’m confused and frustrated because:

1. The allegations kept changing (plagiarism → fabrication → Grammarly misuse).
2. I wasn’t fully informed of my rights (like appeal rights, how evidence is reviewed, etc.).
3. I genuinely believe the Dean made factual errors about Grammarly.
4. I felt pressured to admit when I didn’t believe I had actually committed the offence they were accusing me of.

At this point, I’m not sure if appealing is worth it or if I should just accept the sanctions. Has anyone been through something like this? Is it possible to challenge the process if I felt it was unfair, even though I “admitted” under pressure?",submission,103

Definitely contact them as soon as possible to explore options.

As a prof, I'd also recommend to the subreddit in general that students consider divesting from Grammarly as a ""CYA"" move, especially if you're in courses with an anti-AI policy.

Grammarly has been leaning more and more on branding itself as an AI tool to generate text -- early on with ""Grammarly Go"" but now just integrated in general -- to the point that their website [homepage](https://www.grammarly.com/) explicitly invites people to ""Work with an AI partner that helps turn your thoughts into writing that’s clear, credible, and impossible to ignore,"" while their [students](https://www.grammarly.com/students) page lists it as ""One powerful AI writing surface for any assignment,"" and sitewide and in advertisements they boast all the ways its AI can humanize, rephrase, cite, and generate text on users' behalf etc.

It's going to be exceptionally difficult under those circumstances for any student who admits to using Grammarly to not also be taken as knowingly admitting to use of an AI tool, even if they only used it in the same way they'd use a spellchecker from 2007. (For greater clarity: I'm explaining this interpretation, not defending it). Meanwhile, the lines are only getting blurrier over time: AI is being shoved into every nook and cranny of most software, while AI itself is such a bloated and underdefined term.

But even with all that blurriness, Grammarly is a very explicit case of a product branding itself as an AI tool to generate and edit writing for users, and where students will be assumed to 'have reasonably known' that given the explicit branding. And whereas many departments are working hard to mitigate AI use, it's probably best to avoid it on a principle of precaution in favour of other alternatives, unless you can get it in writing from your instructor that it's authorized. (And even then, keep really robust draft histories!).",comment,48

When you were invited to the meeting, you were sent a copy of the code (which is also publicly available). When the meeting began, the Dean's designate would have read a portion of the code out loud, and verbally confirmed that you had read the relevant portions of the code. If this didn't happen, you may have grounds for an appeal. If this did happen, you acknowledged that you were aware of your rights and cannot use that as an excuse. 


You were entitled to consult with counsel and did not seek it. Consequently, you acted under pressure and confessed. It's pretty hard to retract a confession once you've given it.


If this had happened in a criminal setting, you'd be in hot water right now. While the consequences here are less severe, so too is the burden of proof and your ability to appeal. Unless there was serious misconduct by the Dean's Designate, and you can prove that misconduct, you likely have no recourse. ",comment,29

Just appeal and prove to them grammarly doesn’t do that.


If u didn’t commit an offence you gotta see it until the end. Don’t let them walk over u like that


I’ve been through the first step of an offence they just try to throw shit at a wall and hope it sticks. They literally try to manipulate you like one of those police interrogations in a movie. Bro tried to use the REID technique on me",comment,26

And yes flubbing a citation is technically plagiarism, but it’s so petty that no professor would ever flag a student for that. Especially if there was an effort made…NOW, if the article doesn’t exist at all anymore, then it can be a little suspicious. AI does sometimes wrongly give you fake paths or equivalent. So it does make sense they would start questioning Grammarly which does citation generation. But if you found evidence of the article existing elsewhere maybe under another journal or website then it’s solid proof. BUT 

You shouldn’t have admitted.  This is the whole point of these lil meetings. To save everyone time by getting the individual to admit regardless of the actual offence. You should’ve have stood your ground.",comment,4

Assuming you're citing primary literature, this is a wild claim. Journal articles don't just disappear from the internet. This feels like a very thin defence, and I would also flag it because citing a fake source is very clearly a violation of U of T's academic integrity policy and doesn't leave you with much recourse IMO.",comment,13
