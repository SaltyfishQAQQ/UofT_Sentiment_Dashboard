Roommate etiquette and how to act when you live with people,Major-Persimmon-3087,1nrfro9,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nrfro9/roommate_etiquette_and_how_to_act_when_you_live/,1758928037.0,"I dont want to generalize people or put people in a box but i have really noticed that a lot of international students don't understand etiquette. This morning when I was taking out the trash my roomate came running out and tried to stuff more garbage down the bag even though it was full. I told him if he could wait for me to put a new bag into the bin so that he could dump it there instead. He said no cause im already going out anyway but i said how am i supposed to close it now? with his response being ""not my problem its yours"". i was actually bemused and unfortunately lost my temper.

I started screaming about how he never takes out the trash or flattens anything so how can he judge or make that point when he doesn't do anything. I already was mad about him not doing it but i sucked it up because i just couldnt care enough. but him making the whole thing this morning pushed me over the tipping point. Am i wrong and should i just have been the bigger person?",submission,65

You are his roommate not his housekeeper. It was an absolute jerkass, douchbag response anyways if he really said that, and I'm assuming you had already raised your dissatisfaction prior.",comment,36

It's the both of your responsibility, and frankly if he's really that much of an asshole as to not being able to just carry it and throw it out somewhen public, then he deserves to get chewed out.",comment,12

You displayed the correct reaction. Don’t let people walk over you due to your kindness. Sit down with him one day and ask him politely to help out, may be he might change. If not just make a complaint.",comment,3
