"If you want to talk to someone, just talk to them and put in the work",Noetic_Acorn,1nsv8gx,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nsv8gx/if_you_want_to_talk_to_someone_just_talk_to_them/,1759083007.0,"I understand why this sub is getting an influx of these posts given that it's the beginning of the year, but the answer to your dilemma is rather straightforward: if you want to talk to someone, talk them. About anything.

Analysing the probabilistic outcome of social success and going through the Reddit peer review process to reevaluate your approach strategy isn't going to give you what you want. You're intellectualizing human connection which is a messy, non-linear process.

If there's a person in your class who you're interested in talking to, sit close to them, try and make eye contact, and say ""Hey, how's it going?"" Be the person who breaks the ice and makes someone feel seen. Ask them what they got as an answer for homework assignments or practice questions. Ask to borrow a pen or charger.

""But I have social anxiety!"", you might be thinking to yourself as you type a response. The brutal reality is this topic has been oversaturated in public discourse and people are burnt out of giving special consideration to that. In simpler terms: the average person next to you doesn't really care. They care about their own social anxiety, but not yours, and you probably feel the same way. In an ideal world we'd all talk about our feelings and be respectful of others when they do the same, but this is not the current reality we live in.

People want to talk to others that make them feel good and that don't make them feel like they have an extra responsibility to manage on top of a full course load. Therefore, if social anxiety is a genuine barrier you're going to have to work on this in private with a therapist. Alternatively, you can attend a wellness group where you can work on this with other people in your situation, and even possibly make some friends along the way.

Also, don't make people work for your attention, whether you initiate the conversation or the person you're talking to initiated. Nobody has time or patience for this game, and it doesn't serve you.

Full honesty: taking the risks in initiating conversation doesn't always work out. There is a high chance that someone will scoff at your most genuine and well-intentioned efforts. Unfortunately, that's just life. You can't win everyone over, but you don't have to. All you really need are 3-5 good friends and 1 relationship, if you want. These are manageable numbers. 

If you just want to keep your head down, do your work, and get through the 4 years, don't feel ashamed about this. Know your limits and what you feel like you can realistically handle.

It's tough out there, but not impossible. Face the facts for what they are, take the risks, and put in the work.",submission,44
"If you want to talk to someone, just talk to them and put in the work",Annual-Extreme7944,ngpz7pi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nsv8gx/if_you_want_to_talk_to_someone_just_talk_to_them/ngpz7pi/,1759094745.0,I’m sure many ppl have no problem initiating. The main issue is that after initiating most ppl have no idea how to contribute to a conversation?? Start off by asking abt their program and courses but they will literally reply like they’re being held hostage. I think that’s probably the biggest reason y many get discouraged and just give up… Most ppl seem to think “I’m an introvert” but if someone does all the work for u by approaching u first yall will still refuse to open up. ATP like op said u just want others to work for ur attention… nobody got the patience for that.,comment,18

My younger brother went to Mac, which used to be a very lively and social school, and he ended up coming home every weekend because literally no one on his dorm floor made an effort to speak to anyone else. I think he went to one or two parties in Hamilton but largely stayed inside his social circle from high school by coming home every weekend (so did all his friends for that matter).

Whereas my sister just started out at Laurier and hasn't come home at all. Laurier is three hours away, and none of her dorm roommates are from the GTA, though she has some Toronto friends.

They spend a lot more time away from home, their socialization is a lot better.

My anecdotal experience at my undergrad institute (not in the GTA) is that the GTA kids were generally the most awkward and hardest to have a conversation with. But because we were far from the GTA, it got better throughout the years, and by the end they actually did not relish the idea of going back to Toronto and still in fact come visit regularly when possible.",comment,4

I have always, consistently been the person to initiate with classmates or ask them about the class or their lives. Doesn’t matter in this school.

Hart House offers a lot of free, low-pressure, drop-in programming for U of T students across all departments. It's a very welcoming, inclusive place that understands how difficult it can be to talk to others and form authentic connections. I really do encourage people to drop by and check it out for themselves. It might be a social risks that pays off. https://harthouse.ca/events/week",comment,2

So many ppl are not interested; they come to class and go home immediately with no intention of socializing. It’s way easier to meet people when you join clubs/go to events where people are expecting to socialize. I dont think I made a single long term friend in my undergrad classes, they all came from the clubs i joined or projects i worked on.",comment,2
