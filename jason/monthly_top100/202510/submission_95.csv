I'm looking to apply to life sciences this fall, and I've always been pretty mediocore at school if I'm being honest. I always keep up my grades in the low-high 90s, but I put in the least amount of effort if that makes sense. I don't have the best study habits but I can lock in under pressure.

How are your experiences so far with UofT? 

In this subreddit I've also only seen people talking about how they want to drop out and hate this school. UofT has always been one of my dream schools but I'm not so sure if I'll survive. 

Do I need to study for 5 hours everyday and sacrifice my social life for 70s?

i've enjoyed my time at uoft and have nothing bad to say. it's academically rigorous, but more than manageable. nobody is saying you have to sacrifice your social life and studying a few hours everyday is the norm at any university you go to.",comment,58

Clearly, with 90s you will be able to succeed at UofT. But maybe you will be getting 70s. Or even 60s. You may even fail a course. Or maybe you will still be getting 90s. Or maybe you will be one of the people who switches out from natural sciences to humanities. 

University study is supposed to be work. You are supposed to study to learn (as in, not just for classes). Your grades do not tell the whole story. You should be thinking about making connections between what you study in one class and another. And between what you study for one class and what you study on your own outside of class, just because that's what you do. (Those who don't do this may be the ones you see with the shocked look on their face while they work at a cafe saying that they got 90s in high school and then a degree but no job). 

It's all about the journey. 

The bigger issue is that students who made very little effort in high school but still achieved very high scores have not developed study habits and strategies (ones that university profs assume have been developed). They burn out in university. Or they just continue doing very little and flunk out, refusing to believe that they need to actually stop their social life long enough to study (this last group is often in the ""It's because my teacher doesn't like me!"" crowd, not realising that a lot of the time your teacher doesn't even know you. Because it isn't high school. That's not the primary role of teaching in universities). Or they turn to reddit with fears of going bald from working at studying as if it were a full-time job. 

The students in high school whose grades are usually a little lower who worked really, really hard to get their grade in high school will continue to work really really hard in university (often for a lower grade than in high school for the first year or two). 

Maybe they won't become lawyers, or doctors or k12 teachers. But at least they usually won't just sit there at some non-management retail role until they're thirty years old, spending their time complaining and assuming that somehow someone will just give them the job they ""deserve"" (because they [and an astonishing percent of everyone else] got 90s in high school). 

They'll go do a postgrad with a placement (or even multiple postgrads) at one of the Ontario colleges, and work at getting somewhere doing something that is in some way fulfilling to them.",comment,4

You cannot coast in programs widely considered to be difficult. The people who do are likely those who will drop out early on anyway to make a start-up.

> Do I need to study for 5 hours everyday and sacrifice my social life for 70s?

If you want to do well, you will need to study for far longer than you did in high school. As for your social life, your best bet is to weave it into school life, like making friends with people in your classes and studying with them.

A 90 in the education climate within the past 7 or so years is not worth what it once was.

A lot of people talk about gradeflation, but they aren't aware of what causes it. A number of highschool teachers are being told to mark easier so that the kids have higher averages that look better on university applications. This either comes at the request of administration, parents heckling teachers for ""not realizing how smart my precious angel is"", or even kids going nuts when they receive anything lower than a 90.

The problem is that universities change their admission criteria year-to-year based on a wide variety of factors, many of which are kept hush hush. When they started seeing that all these applying students were getting low to mid 90s, they had to raise the bar. Whereas an 80 10 years ago would have been considered solid enough, the new benchmark is 93 and above. 

This problem is made even worse by the lack of marking standards across schools, even ones within the same board. As such, you end up with some schools having graduating classes with ridiculously high (inflated) averages, whereas other schools might not have inflated the marks as much. 

There are a lot of arguments happening beyond the public eye between universities and schools when it comes to admission.",comment,3
