I pay 64k CAD TUITION per YEAR. On top of that i have to pay like 15-20KCAD living expenses. WHY can the university NOT give me FREE PRINTING ARE WE SERIOUS. I understand the concern of printing 500 pages or stuff but why don’t they give like a small credit to students? That’s how it was managed in my previous schools, and in some you didn’t even have a limit.

AND WHY DO I HAVE TO BUY SO MANY TEXTBOOKS THAT COST $100 💔🙁. For almost every class, and that BS of “you need to buy the wiley plus access”. WHERE DOES ALL THE MONEY I PAY FOR TUITION GO TO?????

Don’t print at libraries because those have a printing cost associated to them, print from the computer labs (like the ones in SF and GB). As a student you have a printing quota already included within your tuition.

2. Try asking your colleagues if they have found the textbook pdfs online, most often if it’s a common major then there’s a drive with the necessary books downloaded. Or just search online there are plenty of sites for that. Alternatively sometimes you can find the book online (sometimes even free to download) directly from the library website, just log into your student account. I personally use the engineering library website but I’m sure any uoft library website will do https://library.utoronto.ca/library/engineering

Overall, if you’re not required to submit online problem sets associated with the textbook (like the ones that come with wiley) then you really don’t have to buy the book, save your money.",comment,23

In fact colleges and universities are a large Ponzi scheme used to for gate keeping jobs and force a loop cycle. Where universities pay and cooperate with big corporations, in turn those big corporations give preferential treatment to graduates of said specific institutions. 

It is their job to force you to pay an expensive tuition, and most of the time. You’re there not because of the lectures/education, but for the degree or certificate. Most professors do a horrible job at teaching and conveying knowledge whether it’s deliberate or not. Those people certainly does not deserve such an expensive salary.

There's a reason why in-province domestic tuition rates barely increase while international students are asked to pay thousands of more dollars per year when universities are constantly demanding more and more money.

[A comparison of postsecondary enrolment trends between domestic and international students by field of study](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/36-28-0001/2023009/article/00003-eng.htm)

""This study examined the relationship between changes in domestic student postsecondary enrolments and the influx of international students during the 2010s. Positive relationships between changes in domestic and international student enrolments in STEM programs at universities and BHASE programs at colleges were found when institution-specific characteristics, aggregate time effects and demographic changes were considered. Also, domestic enrolments in non-degree postsecondary BHASE programs were positively correlated with the influx of international students, not only within the BHASE programs but also at the institutional level. Although this finding may be partly because of common shocks boosting enrolments of both domestic and international students at the same time, **it is consistent with the notion that international students who pay three to five times higher tuition fees may subsidize domestic students in some postsecondary programs.**""

The provincial government actually freezes in-province domestic tuition (the actual program fee rate hasn't increased over this past year while ancillary fees have increased for everyone) but the universities like UofT constantly need more money to keep up their global ranking by outputting more and more research. That's where international students come in: by making them pay more, **UofT can satisfy more of its research and projects to keep up their global ranking without having to fight/beg the province and domestic students for more money.** Universities like UofT need to keep up rankings because it is a massively effective marketing tool; so many students out there simply want to chase prestige.

[Provincial funding itself only made up 32.5% of general university funding in 2020-21](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/o1/en/plus/1896-who-pays-university-education) and universities have generally become more and more reliant on tuition to make up for it.

The issue isn’t about being “fortunate” or “complaining"", it’s about transparency and proportionality in how tuition revenue is allocated, especially given the staggering fees international students pay. U of T markets itself as a globally competitive institution, and that includes the expectation of adequate academic resources and support infrastructure. Pointing out disparities in services (like the absence of even minimal printing credits) isn’t entitlement; it’s a legitimate critique of institutional priorities and value distribution.

Yes, international students choose to study abroad, but that choice doesn’t negate their right to critique inequities within the institution they are actively financing. The *“you chose this”* rhetoric functions as a deflection from legitimate structural concerns. Our (international) school fees are already massively inflated, in most cases even far exceeding the real per-student cost of education, and is often used to subsidise institutional budgets, including domestic tuition gaps. International students aren’t asking for charity; they’re questioning the justifiability of paying premium fees while basic academic services remain inaccessible. As for taxes, international students indirectly contribute through rent, local consumption, and other economic channels. The books we buy have taxes, the meals we eat have taxes. Framing this purely as a matter of national entitlement ignores the broader reality that universities like UofT rely on international enrolment to sustain their operating budgets; Because let's be honest, the taxes your parents paid for *many many many many years* don’t just fund post-secondary education. They’re distributed across public health, infrastructure, social services, housing support, and even emergency accommodation programs. Only a fraction of it directly supports universities. So, why the hostility? International tuition substantially sustains these institutions. It’s like telling someone who significantly contributes to your country’s economy to *“go back to their country”* simply because you refuse to acknowledge that this place can do better. So no, this isn’t about *“attitude.”* It’s about asking the institution to do better. That's all.",comment,2

If international tuition was truly being used to lower domestic costs, we’d likely see tangible reductions or improvements in access and resources for domestic students, but that hasn’t really been the case. What’s really happening is that **provincial funding cuts have forced universities to rely more on international tuition,** and that revenue often gets funneled into research and capital projects to maintain prestige rather than directly easing the financial load on domestic students.

So yes, international students do “keep the lights on,” but it’s mostly to **sustain the university’s ambitions and image,** not to subsidize domestic tuition in any meaningful way.",comment,2

The point I am trying to make is that if international tuition did not ""keep the lights on"" the way it is doing now, universities like UofT would be fighting the government for more funding, whether that's through more direct provincial funding (costing Canadians more through taxes), or more likely since tuition is the majority contributor towards funding nowadays, higher tuition from domestic students. This is especially important when universities are become more and more hungry for producing quality research and programming.

It ends up being a cycle: the university reflects a positive global image in some way (nobel prizes, research breakthroughs, alumni as founder of big company, etc.) --> more students are attracted to join the university as a result --> more money is pumped into university initiatives (more university programs like ASIP, hiring higher quality faculty like those yale law professors that uoft poached a few months back, etc.) --> a couple of those new students are successful and spread the word and grow the university image --> repeat

Without international students, universities like UofT could not compete on the global scale it does without demanding more money from domestic students. In that sense, international students subsidize domestic tuition.

I am emphasizing that UofT, as an institution, aims to compete at a global scale first and foremost. It could not do this either without international tuition, or without asking Canadians for significantly more money.

I remind you that access to credit is also a privilege.
It makes me laugh a little at people who live beyond their means (and are proud of it), but complain about having to pay for what they themselves chose.",comment,1

Education should be one of the top priorities for which you should spend your money on, it’s called an investment for a reason. 

Also, taking on loans anywhere outside of north america is relatively easy fyi.",comment,1

So like that? Ha ha ha . Yes, having to go into debt for ""something"" is living beyond your means.
