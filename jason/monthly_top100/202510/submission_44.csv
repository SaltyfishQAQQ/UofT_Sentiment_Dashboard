While I can’t really fix that (sorry), I can try to help by arranging some sorta hangout to have people meet people! 

Curtesy of u/brihere, who suggested the idea, I’m gonna sit at a bench at the Earth Sciences Centre mini forest (dm me if you can’t find it) and talk to anybody who comes by who says hello. Maybe we’ll be friends, or maybe (if other people also come) you’ll meet a friend! I’ll be there **tomorrow (Sept 29th) at 4:30pm and Wednesday (Oct 1st) 1:30pm.**

There’s only one rule: *no excessive generic work/school talk*. The one thing I’ve learned is that overly talking about work is how shallow relations form. Though that doesn’t exclude more specific topics that might be related to school (e.g. something cool you’ve learned, a prof that’s really passionate). Just try and stay clear from generic “what programs are you in” stuff. 

To help, I’ve compiled a list of questions that hopefully can drive conversation:

- what’s a passion project you’ve been up to? Could be serious, could be unserious. Could be big (an online store) or could be small (collecting coins)

- what’s something you’ve learned in class you find super interesting? Can be from any subject, but assume ppl don’t know anything about it. Talk about what it is, what it means, and why it’s cool.

- what’s something you’ve been learning about generally? E.g. cooking, skateboarding, archery, anything goes. Has it been as interesting as you expected? Harder?

- any hot takes you have? Could be something super serious (there must be aliens) or super unserious (I hate matcha - this is true). What are hot takes you think are stupid?

- what’s a subject you know a lot in? Can be anything from history to chemistry to drawing to fashion. What’s something you wish other people knew about said subject? What’s some misconceptions people have about this subject?

- what’s something that’s been on your mind recently? An unanswered question, an annoying roommate, an idea you had

And for reference, I’m a third year economics and public policy student. If you wanna get me started, ask me about Canadian education policy (wrote an essay about it not too long ago!)

Edit: whoops forgot to add the time",submission,104

It’s rare to see someone take initiative to actually help people connect offline. Love the “no generic work talk” rule  makes it way easier to have real conversations. Hope lots of people show up!,comment,9

I’ll be sitting there in a blue sweater and beige pants.,comment,3
