I also see him everytime at late night nearly every time i come (like 3 am or smtg). He once called my friend to pick up a thing for him that he fell off on the floor, but he did not say it in a nice way. He just said “pick up” like a command which did not feel great. I also saw him yelling at a person but i dont know the context. I’m just curious 😯",submission,48
