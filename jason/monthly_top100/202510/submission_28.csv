Answer for the derivative WIFI name? #Pset 222222222,Kreizhn,ng0aiog,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nplk7t/answer_for_the_derivative_wifi_name_pset_222222222/ng0aiog/,1758744536.0,"This doesn't make a lot of sense. The derivative in this case is an operator, and should act on a function. 3x\^2 + 2x + 4y\^2 -5y -10 = 0 is not a function per se. It could define an implicit function, in which case it would make sense to differentiate that. Per the implicit function theorem, if F(x,y) = 3x\^2 + 2x + 4y\^2 -5y - 10, then the zero locus of F will locally define a function y=f(x) satisfying F(x,f(x)) = 0 anywhere that the y-partial is non-zero (so basically all points except 5/8 ). In that case, you can just implicitly differentiate as usual.",comment,66
