Is UofT really harder than any other universities?,Zealousideal_Farm495,1nuo8oo,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1nuo8oo/is_uoft_really_harder_than_any_other_universities/,1759264032.0,"I’m a 4th-year Psychology Specialist student, and I’ve been struggling with the fact that my GPA feels low compared to some of my friends at TMU or York. Mine is only a 3.5, while many of them in York or TMU  have around a 3.8 or even a 4.0.

Honestly, I’ve seen some of their tests from York and TMU before, and they looked really easy—almost like they were asking questions that felt too basic. That made me believe that York and TMU might just be easier schools overall.

But lately, I’ve started doubting myself. Instead of feeling confident that my program is more demanding, I catch myself thinking that maybe I’m just not that smart, and that UofT isn’t actually as hard as I make it out to be. I keep going back and forth between telling myself it’s because of the school’s difficulty and worrying that I’m just making excuses for having a lower GPA.

I want to quit. I lost my passion for research, and sometimes, I want to end my life because I feel so dumb. I just want anybody to tell me the reality because my cognitive ability is screwed nowadays.",submission,55

Here's a comparison to a random American university; you can see how hard it will be even to get a ""decent"" GPA.

In UMich, \~ [90% of students get a grade of at least a B](https://rossweb.bus.umich.edu/academics/bba-grading-scales-distribution/) (\~ 80%) 

In UofT, \~ [25% of students get a grade of at least a B+](https://rotmancommerce.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/RC-by-the-numbers-2023-24.pdf) (\~ 80%)

Even in Ontario, Western Ivey adjusts the class [average at 80%](https://westerngazette.ca/news/what-s-up-with-the-ivey-bell-curve/article_6f93b976-aa07-11ec-aab5-03e46f335119.html#:~:text=marks%20to%20an-,average%20of%2080,-per%20cent%20for) instead of UofT's 60-70% class average. Suppose you are the admissions office for a master's program or a recruiter from a prestigious company. In that case, you will not be able to factor in the significant GPA deflation this school has and treat both candidates equally.

It’s just an unfortunate reality that going to UofT will give you a lower gpa than if you went elsewhere due to grade deflation, something of which the outside world will never know…",comment,43

I’ve had a couple friends in tmu show me their assignments (we’re in the same program) and sigh………. 

their workload to me seemed a lot easier. 

I also noticed that usage of AI is not that regulated, like you could submit an essay purely AI and their TA & professor will not catch on. 

Their professors to me seem more lenient when it comes to extensions & special privileges. I had a friend transfer from TMU sociology to UofT sociology and she was shocked when her UofT professors denied her a extensions for not reading the due date properly (11:59 am instead of 11:59 pm)

You’re allowed to feel upset and a bit unmotivated. Just remember you’re being held to a higher standard. It is a competitive school.",comment,50

I totally agree that tests, exams etc are way easier at other schools

However the experience at UofT teaches you something EVEN BIGGER. Once you get this degree, you likely have better discipline, and a much better experience once you get a job b/c of how hard you had to learn at UofT. That experience isnt really recieved elsewhere.

Keep your head up man, congrats on making it to yr 4 ur almost there🐐",comment,38

I know a quite few of classmates and friends who transferred from York University, Waterloo, or UBC, to UofT, but as far as I hear from them, they were telling that UofT is very demanding and tough, and very difficult to catch up with. It is also not surprising at UofT to spend an extra year or years to finish.  You are almost there, so please be confident and believe yourself.",comment,3

I'm in grad school at UofT, but my prof knows my alma mater well, another Ontario uni, and they mentioned that up until recently that the UofT department largely considered themselves to be behind my alma mater until a few key retirements there. 


It was funny because professors from my alma mater described my current UofT program as needlessly elitist and mean and I always took that to be little dog syndrome, but it sounds like they were right... ",comment,7

Atleast you have a better shot at making some connections with the faculty and participate in some research

I was like you before, super discouraged after graduating U of T with a psych degree and unable to find any jobs, but eventually with hard work things turned around and now I am doing something I enjoy and making $$, thanks to the interest I started with in psych",comment,3

Honestly, uoft has it easier (coming from stem) compared to the 'better' uni but is so much harder than the no name one - it's always a comparative thing and I would say don't worry too much. You're at one of the best unis in the world and once you're done with your course and are out in the real world, you'll come to appreciate the struggle.

I’m amazed by it still but the big issue most have is that you have to seek the help. If you’re an outgoing and social person UofT will be liveable but if you try and do it all on your own you could struggle quite a bit,comment,1
