uoft is a great place! i hope you find some happiness here and make the best of your situation!",comment,80

Everyone literally just lies, whether its about their average or course loads, everything is way easier than expected

It won't actively ""hate"" you per se, but there's a lot less support that what other universities seem to have. Ultimately just polarizes between people who can and can't naturally socialize

I have yet to meet anyone who is thriving at UofT and didn't attend: 
- A private school
- IB program 
- Rigorous after school program
- A school in another country with a more robust education system

I've spoken to a number of professors and instructors that are genuinely concerned by the state of education in Canada, particularly in math. Even the ones who want you to succeed unfortunately can't do much given how thinly they're spread across all the different hats they wear.",comment,12

I think the size of UofT is what gives students a feeling of coldness rather than anything else. We feel like just a number, which isn’t the case in the rest of Ontario. I’ve seen this bleed into my interactions with faculty and administration especially.",comment,13

everyone's a little different, but i would say a big one for me was learning my limits. at uoft, there's objectively not enough time to do all the work you're assigned (if you're taking more than four courses at a time), so knowing yourself and not pushing past your limits is a big one! it will always lead burnout and depression (in my case), which are really, really hard to recover from, especially if you still have schoolwork to deal with on top of it.

i would really say be gentle with yourself. if you're able and if you need to, there's no shame in taking three courses a semester! there's also no shame in taking more than four years to graduate!",comment,1

I think it does boil down to large size and strained staff; like I didn't have a class with less than 100 people until one in 3rd year, and TAs always have barely enough time for their one hour with 30 kids. 

Then there's also a few other things like commuters, language barriers, decentralized club/event communications, disorganized academic advising, etc. that just kinda culminate.

Again none of these outright hold anyone back, but if you can't naturally strike up conversations, they are difficult to get over.",comment,2
