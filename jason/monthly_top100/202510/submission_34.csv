We haven’t been together for long but we both feel like we’ve never meet anyone so in sync

I don’t think this is replicable though. There’s a reason why I was going to quit dating apps, and it’s literally a one in 70 billion chance that we met each other. I really don’t expect this being a reliable formula for romance.",comment,3

No chances! But at queens the only white man that approached me was in first year at a so-called club on the main drag on so-called downtown Kingston to say “are you ok?”. He was nice but a bit nerdy. Anyways that’s kind of a cutsy story! We kinda kept in touch later but it didn’t work out. Does that help? 🥂😎🐕🐕🙏🎄🇨🇦❤️,comment,1
