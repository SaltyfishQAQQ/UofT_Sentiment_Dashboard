The best step would be to talk with your college’s registrar; ideally the main registrar. I’m not sure which college you’re in, but I’m in UC (University College), and Ryan, who I believe is the director, is exceptionally helpful. 
You could also reach out to the accessibility center, they might be able to support you too. 
If you need to go back home, they might be able to help you attend classes online. 
Wishing you the best 🙏",comment,13

You can literally in the meantime walk to any family doctor and explain ur situation with INDUCED REAL PHYSICAL STRESS cuz this is a real issue that you need help and aid for. Not stress about skipping. Plz be ur best advocate a lot of ppl are assholes I hope you get an extension. Talk to the prof irl even be genuine this will also build real world skills once u graduate,comment,2
