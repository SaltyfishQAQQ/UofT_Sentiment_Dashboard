"University lore, does UofT have any interesting folklore?",schanino,1o1seu4,https://www.reddit.com/r/UofT/comments/1o1seu4/university_lore_does_uoft_have_any_interesting/,1759970917.0,"I was talking to a friend at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and he was telling me about some strange folklore that happens on his campus. For example, there’s “Tunnel Bob,” a guy who hides in the winter tunnels to look at girls. He wasn’t fired because he’s the only person willing to work inside the heat vents. There’s also the “Sullivan baby,” a secret baby born in the Sullivan residence basement. Now, all that remains there are pregnancy tests and condoms. And then there’s the entire university’s culture of hating its own sports team.

I was wondering if we had anything similar that we could share with people, something cooler than Robarts being alive or the McDonald’s in AA UTSC.
