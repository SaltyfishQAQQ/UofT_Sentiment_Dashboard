and dont compare yourself to others only compare yourself to who you were yesterday and how much you improved focus on your grades and gpa and try to find friends and built a social circle as for everyone else its al noise theres an idea called signal to noise ratio by steve jobs in your waking hours of your tasks should be signal and signal i what needs to get done today priorities like work studying exercising to do list and important things you have to finish today noise everything else goals future plans social life miscellaneous tasks thinking what other ppl are doing and comparing yourself with them once you do this you get closer to the goal daily and actually accomplish a lot and before you know it you reached that goal take university for instance if you think about the fact that you need credits to get your bachelors and this gpa and to make post if you havent for example and etc etc youll always be stressed have anxiety fomo and think about what other people are doing and procrastinate cuz youre full of noise and your mind is thinking about the noise cut away all the noise and theres millions of differences between each person and no one is the same everyones environment background personality work ethic social circle network connections luck circumstances are different i can tell you from firsthand experience and seeing this with my own eyes time and time again dont feel like youre behind and other people are doing better than you majority of students that have a great empty resume are not that bright and its a lot of fakery imitation and fooling people going on i have several friends at uoft that if you go on their linked in profile and other social media youd think theyre ceo of chase bank or chairman of the federal reserve or a billionaire entrepreneur or ceo of fortune or a world leader in politics but theyre failing university have no routine or schedule wake up at noon and theyre doing so many universal things that looks nice and productive and that theyre successful but its all for looks and its all noise at the end of the day see why your goals are and focus on them is it grad school law or medical school focus on your gpa and boost your grades as much as you can cuz thats of what matters youre a university student and your job is the university and studying thats the priority any extra time you have join student clubs university events job fairs grad school fairs build your resume and update it and apply to a dozen jobs a week but again thats secondary right now priority is great grades i used to think like you but once i set goals with a timeline and deadline and broke it down into steps then im signal daily and get closer to my goals daily and i never think about other ppl or if theyre doing better than me whats popular trading or try to copy and emulate them cuz i have my goals and know what it takes to achieve them and get there and im on track the reason you feel this way is because you might not have a well defined goal plan or end result you want to achieve badly and strive towards daily a goal without a deadline timeline and plan is only wishful thinking and lying to yourself break the goal down and tell yourself what does it truly take what actions do i need to implement what habits to develop and what to do daily to get increments closer to that result or goal then implant the signal to ratio daily you dont have to do signals and noise thats just an example do or and you be so busy and productive that you wont even have time or energy to think about others and work lent care less what theyre doing or are up to have a sense of urgency but with yourself and your life not against someone else and what theyre doing believe me a lot of your peers and ppl you see that have it all figured out dont have shit figured out theyre just trying so many different things at once and hope one sticks only difference is theyre doing and taking action even though that action is without planning and all over the place which can help them hence the linked in profiles with dozens of accreditations certificates volunteer and student club experiences that of employers dont care about and they care about your degree real world work experience not being the head of a student club and some care about your gpa if its hyper competitive and they ask for it also having great people around you is key friends are overrated if its just fake friendships and wasting your time in social circles pick and choose the people you associate with carefully and asses if theyre value to your life if theyre genuinely good people if they have the same values and principles you truly are the average of the people you hang withthats a cardinal rule and fact but friendships and being social cant be forced let it come to you and itll happen naturally just be open to socializing and communication and try to network and connect with classmates in lectures tutorials and another great way to meet friends and intervening people is at the gym or any event the university offers final tip update your resume monthly and make tweets to it and make it ai optimized i forgot the correct scanning algorithm but majority of businesses and employers use ai to scan resumes for what theyre looking for whether that name be this is cuz they get hundreds of resumes and it makes it easier albeit cold and heartless and they might miss bright candidates doing this go to office hours a lot and create a relationship and somewhat friendship with your profs try to do research with them or work with or volunteer for them reference letters from profs is worth an entire linked in profile and all the jargon you see on there become friends with your profs essentially and before you know it your circle is intellectuals and people that can add value to your job prospects,comment,29,NEU,"{'NEG': 0.005035837646573782, 'NEU': 0.7668988704681396, 'POS':

yourself with them once you do this you get closer to the goal daily and actually accomplish a lot and before you know it you reached that goal take university for instance if you think about the fact that you need credits to get your bachelors and this gpa and to make post if you havent for example and etc etc youll always be stressed have anxiety fomo and think about what other people are doing and procrastinate cuz youre full of noise and your mind is thinking about the noise cut away all the noise and theres millions of differences between each person and no one is the same everyones environment background personality work ethic social circle network connections luck circumstances are different i can tell you from firsthand experience and seeing this with my own eyes time and time again dont feel like youre behind and other people are doing better than you majority of students that have a great empty resume are not that bright and its a lot of fakery imitation and fooling people going on i have several friends at uoft that if you go on their linked in profile and other social media youd think theyre ceo of chase bank or chairman of the federal reserve or a billionaire entrepreneur or ceo of fortune or a world leader in politics but theyre failing university have no routine or schedule wake up at noon and theyre doing so many universal things that looks nice and productive and that theyre successful but its all for looks and its all noise at the end of the day see why your goals are and focus on them is it grad school law or medical school focus on your gpa and boost your grades as much as you can cuz thats of what matters youre a university student and your job is the university and studying thats the priority any extra time you have join student clubs university events job fairs grad school fairs build your resume and update it and apply to a dozen jobs a week but again thats secondary right now priority is great grades i used to think like you but once i set goals with a timeline and deadline and broke it down into steps then im signal daily and get closer to my goals daily and i never think about other ppl or if theyre doing better than me whats popular trading or try to copy and emulate them cuz i have my goals and know what it takes to achieve them and get there and im on track the reason you feel this way is because you might not have a well defined goal plan or end result you want to achieve badly and strive towards daily a goal without a deadline timeline and plan is only wishful thinking and lying to yourself break the goal down and tell yourself what does it truly take what actions do i need to implement what habits to develop and what to do daily to get increments closer to that result or goal then implant the signal to ratio daily you dont have to do signals and noise thats just an example do or and you be so busy and productive that you wont even have time or energy to think about others and work lent care less what theyre doing or are up to have a sense of urgency but with yourself and your life not against someone else and what theyre doing believe me a lot of your peers and ppl you see that have it all figured out dont have shit figured out theyre just trying so many different things at once and hope one sticks only difference is theyre doing and taking action even though that action is without planning and all over the place which can help them hence the linked in profiles with dozens of accreditations certificates volunteer and student club experiences that of employers dont care about and they care about your degree real world work experience not being the head of a student club and some care about your gpa if its hyper competitive and they ask for it also having great people around you is key friends are overrated if its just fake friendships and wasting your time in social circles pick and choose the people you associate with carefully and asses if theyre value to your life if theyre genuinely good people if they have the same values and principles you truly are the average of the people you hang withthats a cardinal rule and fact but friendships and being social cant be forced let it come to you and itll happen naturally just be open to socializing and communication and try to network and connect with classmates in lectures tutorials and another great way to meet friends and intervening people is at the gym or any event the university offers final tip update your resume monthly and make tweets to it and make it ai optimized i forgot the correct scanning algorithm but majority of businesses and employers use ai to scan resumes for what theyre looking for whether that name be this is cuz they get hundreds of resumes and it makes it easier albeit cold and heartless and they might miss bright candidates doing this go to office hours a lot and create a relationship and somewhat friendship with your profs try to do research with them or work with or volunteer for them reference letters from profs is worth an entire linked in profile and all the jargon you see on there become friends with your profs essentially and before you know it your circle is intellectuals and people that can add value to your job prospects,comment,3,NEU,"{'NEG': 0.005015924107283354, 'NEU': 0.7664451003074646, 'POS':

23:50:34,heres my thoughts as a 5th year uoft student well uoft is a research intensive university and produces a lot of research compared to all canadian unversities and even the top best universities globally it is the most prestigious univeristy in canada and ranks 21st globally and is the only canadian university consistently ranking in top and only canadian univeristy ranking in top even like i mentioned its a research intensive university where a lot of focus and resources is on research output rather than quality of teaching classrooms and student engagement so majority of professors for undergraduate programs and courses are involved in research and write scholarly articles publish books work on studies and contribute to scholarly journals although quality of teaching is still exceptional its not the universities main focus their main focus is research for one there is not much of a fun univeristy experience due to the scale of the university and how many students it has it has satellite campuses both equally prestigious and collectively uoft has students annually due to the large scale of the university and even the st george campus alone which is scattered around the heart of downtown toronto and the fact that there is tens of thousands of students at st george alone there is no sense of community you might meet someone or make a friend but rarely see them or never see them at all classes can be students easily even for levelsecond year classes although by 3rd and 4th year classes due get smaller with level classes being students or lessseminars and below its very academically demanding and challenging especially for undergrad a uoft undergrad writes more research papers than their counterparts at tmu york or western in the same program and theres a lot of competition among students to get into their majors and specialists and this is also spread into the student culture professors also do tend to mark on a curve and departments tell them there is a very limited number of as they can give note not saying its impossible to get as or a high gpa but its very difficult and you need exceptional organization work ethic disciple and hours and hours of studying much more effort to get a high gpa than any other university in canada that being said st george is a bit more prestigious not because of the quality of education but because the same programs uoft mississauga or scarborough offer st george has higher standards for entry for undergrad this is due to main factors its location and amenities beautiful and historic campus in the short of downtown toronto and multiple gyms more than a dozen libraries and dozens of food courts close to bars offices shops entertainment etc etc in fact many hollywood movies that portray harvard or princeton are filmed on st george campuscuz filing in canada is cheaper than us side note even utm has a very modern aestehtic and beautiful campus surrounded by erindlae forest and movies like downsizing and shows like gen v were filmed there secondly st george is more sought after by applicants due to the many co op research and work opportunities on campus and around campus youre in the heart of downtown toronto the 4th largest city in north america and the business financial and culture hub of canada st george campus offers more programs and more courses per program although utm and utsc students can still enrol in st george classes and vice versa but st george students get priority in st george classes and vice versa there is an emerging and alarming rise in students not finishing in years due to the demanding nature of the university and some take extra classes to either boost their cgpa for grad school law and med schools or they drop or withdraw form courses in first and second year or some like fail a course in their first or second year best thing to do is take credits in fallwinter and in summer and doing that for years to finish in years instead of taking credits in fallwintera regular academic year which most new first years foolishly do the uoft degree is very much valued tho not just in canada but top firms and companies in us and top grad schools and law schools in us value it a lot and hold it with great regard and prestige majority of uoft professors are ivey league graduates or studied at oxford and cambridge and if they arent ivey league or oxbridge graduates they at least taught at oxbridge or ivey look schoolsand majority like i said are actively doing research and have dozens of scholarly articles books and studies published uoft also has the fame because of their name being the oldest university in canada and their research output and the quality of that research the college system at st george for instance is also inspired by oxford and cambridge its a great university and the best in canada but if you werent the best student in high school and dont have great work ethic discipline and studying skills dont go there its easier to get accepted than to graduate from uoft for your undergraduate degree while its still hard to get in and in fact much harder than any other canadian university graduating is even harder because of all the reasons i mentioned,comment,3,NEU,"{'NEG': 0.008885077200829983, 'NEU': 0.8272930979728699, 'POS':
